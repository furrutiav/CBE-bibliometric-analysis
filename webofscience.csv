The findings of key competencebased articles confirm that competence discourse in education has become a highly rated topic of debate from 1999 to 2013. In the two last decades, there has been a gradual increase in articles based on research combined with a decline in articles of a descriptive nature. The main contributions of articles on competency-based education are significantly in line with topics related to reflection on competence discourse and education policies that should be implemented.

To bridge this gap competence-based curricula were developed with instructional designs as authentic learning contexts and self-directed learning. In this project we explored final year Bachelor Nursing (BN) students' experiences in learning in a newly developed curriculum, and their knowledge quality outcomes and the degree of agreement with knowledge requirements. An instrumental multiple case study was conducted with interviews, concept mapping and a domain knowledge list. Results show that a third of the participants had positive learning experiences and got high appraisals for their knowledge quality. Similar to the medium and low scoring participants, they developed instrumental knowledge but integrated other forms of learning into a system of meaning, which is needed to solve non-routine problems in future practice. Medium and low scoring participants did not profit from learning in authentic contexts and self-directed learning. In conclusion, developing sufficient professional knowledge in a constructivist competence-based curriculum is influenced by students' intrinsic motivation to build a strong knowledge base, by their perception of how to learn and use professional knowledge, and their expectations of the degree of supervision and guidance by the teacher. It is recommended to evaluate the extent to which the intended curriculum is being taught.",,,,,,,,,,,59,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2022,15.0,1,,,,,21,47,,10.1007/s12186-021-09274-4,,SEP 2021,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000697077200001

The article distinguishes between policy-critical thinking and civic-critical thinking. Relying on analyses of curriculum and policy documents, it is concluded that while in the Swedish context critical thinking competence (or ability) seems to be much more implicit than explicit, in Kosovo, the national curriculum makes explicit references to thinking competences as a form of policy-critical thinking and civic competencies as a form of civic-critical thinking. Thus, students in both contexts have opportunities to develop critical thinking skills.

This move, beyond what any document can deal with, does not seem to find its way into everyday school practice easily or with instant results. This paper explores encounters and clashes between policy and practice regarding a competence-based curriculum framework. We refer firstly to the notions about information processing and digital competence held by international organisations and the Spanish and Catalan Ministry of Education, and the implications of said notions for teaching. Then, from evidence collected through class observations, interviews with students and teachers, and documents analysis in a case study, we draw on four teaching and learning scenarios where ICT is regularly used. Promoting students' digital competence is one of the key competences prescribed in the curriculum; however, our study showed that the backgrounds and educational views of teachers, as well as the teaching culture and organisation of schools, should be deeply challenged to foster this competence.",,,,,,,,,,,29,17,18,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2016,5.0,1,,,,,57,63,,10.7821/naer.2016.1.157,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000382830000010

First, we analyze the necessity of artificial intelligence education at the fundamental education stage and the status quo of artificial intelligence education in China. Next, we elaborate the students' key competencies which is composed of knowledge competence, team competence and learning competence, and design the curriculum of artificial intelligence at the fundamental education stage. Finally, through collecting students' questionnaires, we analyze the relationship between the curriculum of artificial intelligence and the cultivation of students' key competencies.

For this, the study uses qualitative data from three schools (one each in South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand). The results indicate that a transformative approach, not an additive approach, is required. That is, teachers tend to restructure existing curricula to develop students' key competencies instead of considering the latter as a new teaching component. In terms of instructional methods, teachers are likely to believe that more engaging and participatory instructional methods would help their students to practice and develop diverse aspects of their competencies. Further, the principal's efforts to enhance communication and interaction with teachers is crucial to constructing local definitions of key competencies and shared visions for integrating such competencies with school curricula and instruction.

Given the changing and complex demands in public health, we study the relative importance of generic and field-specific competencies during the transition from education to the public health field. A self-explicated approach and a choice-based conjoint analysis were used to elicit preferences of employers for key competencies. The results show that employers value generic competencies relatively higher than field-specific competencies for master level graduates entering the public health field. The results are relevant for the adjustment of training in public health. Universities should continue to train master level graduates in public health with high-level cognitive skills.

These changes have been creating new demands for more adaptable, multi-skilled and creative labour. To meet the demands, it seems necessary to reduce the gap between academic education and vocational education; to raise the general education background of vocational education; to widen the route from vocational education to higher education; to deploy competence-based curriculum development mechanisms; to strengthen the co-operation between the education authorities and employment organization as well as industries; to decentralize the delivery system and to involve employers more in the process of TVET.

Since then, key competences have been integrated into the official curriculum in Spain. The objectives of the present study are: a) to describe the strategies used most frequently by physical education teachers to incorporate key competences in their programmes; and b) to identify the profiles of teachers and schools that promote the inclusion of key competences in their physical education programmes. Data were collected via a questionnaire administered to a sample of 2051 physical education teachers in primary and secondary schools in Spain. The results show that while teachers include key competences in their programmes, they do not usually do so explicitly. The competences most frequently included are: social and citizenship skills; autonomy and personal initiative; learning to learn; and knowledge of, and interaction with, the physical world. To develop these competences, lesson plans often aim to integrate knowledge, skills and attitudes, apply problem-solving approaches, and foster the transfer of learning to everyday life. The lack of interdisciplinarity emerges as a negative aspect. Factors favouring the inclusion of competences are the provision of competence-based training for teachers and the presence of a coordination system for dealing with competences in the school. The conclusion drawn is that merely including key competences in the official curriculum is not enough; reinforcement and correction of all the aspects mentioned are essential to ensure that adequate attention is paid to competences in physical education programmes.",,,,,,,,,,,88,11,12,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2016,22.0,4,,,,,506,525,,10.1177/1356336X15621497,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000386010000007

This paper aims to discuss the qualities of competence-oriented educational processes and the recent movement towards competence-based curricula in higher education. Design/methodology/approach This study follows a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology to explore the concept of competence within the context of educational science. The subsequent thematic synthesis analyses the findings of reviewed publications regarding graduate attributes in competence-oriented higher education and their perspectives and working-life expectations on exit profiles. Findings Interest in competence-oriented education, training and learning has grown in recent years, resulting in numerous theoretical and technical pedagogical applications in higher education. Nonetheless, ambiguous terminology presents a significant challenge, which is demonstrated by the inconsistent language of the study's results. Moreover, there is an obvious need for teachers' in-service training.

In medical education, extensive literature exists about validated competency frameworks for example, the CanMEDS competency framework. In contrast, comparable literature is limited in nursing, midwifery, and allied health disciplines. Therefore, this study aims to investigate (1) the completeness of the CanMEDS Roles, and (2) the relevance, formulation, and measurability of the CanMEDS key competencies in nursing, midwifery, and allied health disciplines. If the competency framework is validated in different educational programs, opportunities to support CBE and interprofessional education/collaboration can be created. Methods A three-round online Delphi study was conducted with respectively 42, 37, and 35 experts rating the Roles (n = 7) and key competencies (n = 27). These experts came from non-university healthcare disciplines in Flanders (Belgium): audiology, dental hygiene, midwifery, nursing, occupational therapy, podiatry, and speech therapy. Experts answered with yes/no (Roles) or on a Likert-type scale (key competencies). Agreement percentages were analyzed quantitatively whereby consensus was attained when 70% or more of the experts scored positively. In round one, experts could also add remarks which were qualitatively analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results After round one, there was consensus about the completeness of all the Roles, the relevance of 25, the formulation of 24, and the measurability of eight key competencies. Afterwards, key competencies were clarified or modified based on experts' remarks by adding context-specific information and acknowledging the developmental aspect of key competencies. After round two, no additional key competencies were validated for the relevance criterion, two additional key competencies were validated for the formulation criterion, and 16 additional key competencies were validated for the measurability criterion. After adding enabling competencies in round three, consensus was reached about the measurability of one additional key competency resulting in the validation of the complete CanMEDS competency framework except for the measurability of two key competencies. Conclusions The CanMEDS competency framework can be seen as a grounding for competency-based healthcare education. Future research could build on the findings and focus on validating the enabling competencies in nursing, midwifery, and allied health disciplines possibly improving the measurability of key competencies.",,,,,,,,,,,59,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,APR 10,2022,22.0,1,,,,,,,260,10.1186/s12909-022-03308-8,,,,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines",,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000779951400002

However, the perspective of future employees also seems to be worth discussing; hence this research covers university students currently entering the labour market. Ten competencies identified as key in the labour market are examined: problem-solving, creativity and innovation, analytical and critical thinking, active learning and teaching, interdisciplinarity, emotional intelligence, social intelligence, intercultural competencies, virtual cooperation, digital competency. The study aimed to determine the respondents' opinions and beliefs about selected key competencies on the labour market, their willingness to develop them, and their declared level of these competencies. The survey was carried out using the quantitative method, using the CAWI technique, on a sample of 352 respondents - students of the University of Lodz. The results indicate that the students mostly share the view that the competencies indicated as being key will be expected by employers in the labour market in the next five years. Moreover, for most of the competencies being studied, they assess their current level to be high and see the need to develop them for professional purposes.

Afterwards, a sample of 150 syllabi from different disciplines of five Chilean public universities were analysed, all of which stated the use of learning outcomes and competences in their learning models. Using a three-point Likert scale derived from the aforementioned criteria and their indicators, a comparison was made between the actual practices reflected in the syllabus design and the previously established criteria. Results show a gap between the declaration of a competency-based curriculum and actual syllabus outlines. Moreover, there are important differences among disciplines.

It specifically focuses on the key competencies of 'thinking' and 'relating to others', and explores how teachers in an urban intermediate school (year 7 and 8) planned and integrated learning objects into a wider 'community' social studies topic, and the impact this integration had on student competency development. Outcomes from the study indicate that learning objects can, for some students, provide a motivating and engaging learning experience through which thinking capabilities and relationship skills can be enhanced, but that such development is dependent upon several factors including the design, content, and level of interactivity of the objects, how closely they align with learning goals, the careful selection of student groupings, and how access to the learning objects is organised and managed. The study also revealed some issues with the use of new digital data collection tools, particularly related to the accuracy of coding of visual information, and how to best translate this into text format for publication without 'diluting' its richness and meaning.",,,,,,,,,,,31,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,,2010,26.0,5,,,,,626,642,,,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000280527900004

The aim of the research was to examine teachers on self-assessment of competencies that were crucial for innovating the teaching process. The sample of respondents included 1300 elementary and secondary school teachers in the territory of Southern Serbia. The instrument used was a five-point TCS scale of attitudes, with a total of 48 items (individual competencies). The results of the analysis showed that teachers, based on their self-assessments, highly value all diverse groups of competencies, which fully confirms the general hypothesis. The results also showed the existence of statistically significant differences in the degree of expression of attitudes about competency groups with regard to independent research variables, within special hypotheses, based on which the first was rejected, the second partially and the third and fourth special hypothesis fully confirmed.

We aimed to construct a competence inventory applicable as an instrument to measure the content validity of workplace based assessment tools, such as portfolio. Methods: A Delphi study was carried out based on the CanMEDS Roles Framework. In three rounds, experts (N = 25-30) were invited to score the key competences per CanMEDS role on relevance (6-point Likert-scale), and to comment on the content and formulation bearing in mind its use in workplace based assessment. A descriptive analysis of relevances and comments was performed. Results: Although all competences were scored as relevant, many comments pointed at a lack of concrete, transparent and applicable descriptions of the key competences for the purpose of assessment. Therefore, the CanMEDS roles were reformulated in this Delphi procedure as concrete learning outcomes, observable and suitable for workplace based assessment.

The urgent need to train citizens, who are actively committed to the principles and values of sustainability, derives from these problems. The local point of this issue has two main aspects: the first lotuses on transformative action as a nurturing dynamic of the training process; the second considers the competencies that education should aim to promote. On the one hand the paper reviews the updated typology of competencies which, described as 'transformative', are included in the Learning Compass 2030 (OECD, 2019). This adds complexity to the training proposal of the DeSeCo model (OECD, 2005). On the other hand, there is an analysis of the significant aspects of the typology of key competencies for sustainability, as promoted by UNESCO (2014; 2018a). From a reflective consideration of both typologies, the lack of elements (capacities) necessary to reach a critical awareness of species - whose training significantly affects what each individual can become - is evident. The so-called 'existential competencies' of Edgar Morin (2016), which point to the most radical core of the human being, are then proposed as complementary to strengthen the consistency of the model. These competencies are not explicitly included in the, otherwise laudable, initiatives which international organisations and institutions are deploying in order to bring the Education 2030 agenda to fruition. However, it is necessary to focus attention on them within the framework of a truly transformative quality education. Therefore, incorporating them into the competency model dominant on an international level is imperative in order to radically address the gravity, and urgency, of current socio-ecological problems. Anthropological substrate, provided by a biocentric humanism, is required to carry this out. This is a substrate committed to the moral responsibility which requires preserving the dignity of life in its extraordinary diversity.",,,,,,,,,,,60,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,JUL-DEC,2021,33.0,2,,,,,107,128,,10.14201/teri.25375,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000659193200006

The following two questions were addressed: Q1. What kind of sustainability competences do participants acquire in the Master Class? Q2. What is the role of PBL in the learning outcomes? Design/methodology/approach The study is based on an ex ante open-ended survey and post-ante interviews addressed to the participants. The data were analysed using the qualitative content analysis. Findings The findings show that the Master Class contributed to most of the competences under study. However, unlike in previous studies, systemic thinking is highlighted as a fundamental rather than a parallel core competence. Furthermore, the results also emphasise the role of emotions, which is insufficiently acknowledged and accounted for in sustainability education. Research limitations/implications - The study focussed only on the learning outcomes of the participants (students) and not the other parties (such as company and researchers). Practical implications - Future research should focus on affective dimension as a stepping stone to the transformational learning. In addition, the role of the systemic understanding in sustainability education should be highlighted as a core competence. Social implications - The study revealed the overall positive impacts of the co-creation in university business collaboration to the participants' sustainability competences. Originality/value The study presents an empirical case study where the various competence frameworks were applied with a result of confirming the validity of the existing key competences, in particular the systemic understanding and showing the role of the affective dimension in the transactional learning.",,,,,,,,,,,53,12,12,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 4,2019,20.0,6,,,,,965,984,,10.1108/IJSHE-11-2018-0215,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000489022400001

At the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University, a structured medical didactic qualification programme prepares and trains future tutors for their responsibilities. This programme consists of four modules: 1. medical didactics and group leadership, 2. subject-specific training, 3. performance of tutorial courses as well as 4. collegial advice and reflection on the tutors' activities. The aim of this study is to systematically analyse and present the development of role competencies for medical tutors based on the CanMEDS Physician Competency Framework through the didactic qualification programme.MethodsWe applied a qualitative research approach to detect CanMEDS role competencies acquisition within the tutor qualification programme. The CanMEDS framework describes key competencies, grouped thematically under seven professional roles. Two tutors and three training coordinators independently assigned the individual modules of the tutor qualification programme to the key competencies of the CanMEDS framework. Tutors and training coordinators compared and discussed the allocations within the groups in a consensus finding process. All authors analysed the findings in order to find out the so-called hidden curriculum. The views of both groups are presented separately.ResultsThe training programme promotes the acquisition of competencies in all seven CanMEDS roles. The roles of the scholarand the leaderare promoted in all modules. In addition, the first and fourth module focus predominately on the role of the collaborator, the second on the role of the medical expert and communicator, and the fourth on the role of the professional.ConclusionsThe systematic analysis through assignment of the CanMEDS roles to the individual modules of the tutor qualification programme documents the comprehensive acquisition of competencies, not only with regard to the tutor activity, but generally with regard to the later role of the physician. The reflection on one's own competency acquisition can support the promotion of corresponding competencies in the qualification programme and their transfer into the professional practice later.",,,,,,,,,,,33,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 4,2019,19.0,,,,,,,,187,10.1186/s12909-019-1636-5,,,,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines",,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000470289200002

One of the areas affected by these changes are the foreign language competences necessary to efficiently deal with study and job related practices and, correspondingly, to succeed in the job market. Along with the change in student needs comes the demand for change in the organization of language classrooms and instruction. Young people, facing a deluge of information and unlimited access to resources, are challenged by the changing needs in processing the material. A qualitative approach to information is required with a growing focus on information processing, analysis, critical evaluation and implementation in practice. Similarly, the need for efficient communication skills such as negotiation, argumentation or presenting seem to be more in demand than grammatical precision or encyclopedic knowledge.

The goal is to provide evidence for the improvement of existing and the thorough design of new EBL formats in sustainability programs. Design/methodology/approach This comparative case study focuses on the first semester of three graduate sustainability programs at Leuphana University of Luneburg, Germany and Arizona State University, USA, for two of which EBL was a core feature. The study compares the curricula, the teaching and learning environments and the reported experiences of one student cohort from each of three programs and synthesizes the resulting insights. Student interviews were combined with student self-assessments and supported by in-vivo observations, curriculum designer input, instructor interviews and course materials. MAXQDA was used for data analysis following a grounded theory approach. Findings EBL influences students' reflective capacity, which impacts the development of key competencies in sustainability. Qualitative analysis found four key themes in relation to the students' learning in EBL settings, namely, discomfort, time-attention relationship, student expectations of instructors and exchange. The intersection of these themes with curricular structure, student dispositions and differing instructor approaches shows how curriculum can either support or interrupt the reflective cycle and thus, holistic learning. Research limitations/implications With the focus on the first semester only, the students' competence development over the course of the entire program cannot be demonstrated. Learning processes within EBL settings are complex and include aspects outside the control of instructors and curriculum designers. This study addresses only a select number of factors influencing students' learning in EBL settings. Practical implications Early engagement with EBL activities can push students to leave their comfort zones and question previous assumptions. Designing curricula to include EBL while encouraging strong intra-cohort connections and creating space for reflection seems to be an effective approach to enable the development of key competencies in sustainability. Originality/value This paper investigates the experiences of students in EBL through a key competence lens. The study combines student self-perceptions, instructor reflections and in-vivo observations. Data collection and analysis were conducted by a researcher not affiliated with the programs. These factors make for a unique study design and with data-driven insights on the seldom researched competence-pedagogy-curriculum connection.",,,,,,,,,,,47,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 25,2021,22.0,2,,,,,237,253,,10.1108/IJSHE-08-2019-0242,,DEC 2020,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000599177600001

Drawing on critical policy research, I examine three international policy events in which experts convened to discuss, debate, and co-construct ideas related to competencies in education. I argue that by structuring the assessment of knowledge and fixing meanings, the OECD, along with networks of experts, has created and diffused a particular social imaginary of a globally competent learner. Given the complexity and uncertainty of the world today, increasing the global and intercultural knowledge and awareness of the world's students is vitally important.

Then, I situate the discussion of KCs within the sociological critique of the new mode of learning deemed essential for a knowledge society'. I identify KCs' potential to naturalize the (re)production of inequalities through schooling and argue that this can be further compounded by the extraction of KCs from the lifelong learning policy discourse. Finally, I ground these expositions in the specific policy context of Japanese education, highlighting how KCs and its decoupled articulation pose a difficult policy dilemma for Japan's Ministry of Education attempting to address the widening class-based inequalities through schooling. Hence, this study critiques the contemporary school curriculum reform driven by KCs by tracing the flow of this concept from the international policy discourse down to the level of a national policy development.

A sample of 1793 students and 125 school leaders from 125 schools was used. The findings show variation in digital competence both between students and between schools. Results from a multilevel analysis showed that higher levels of mastery orientation and self-efficacy (i.e., motivation) and the students' family background (i.e., language integration and the number of books at home) were predictors of students' levels of digital competence. Additionally, when school leaders reported higher levels of culture for professional development among the teachers at school, increased levels of digital competence were found among students.

In this qualitative multiple case study, 30 rural teachers from Zimbabwe's 10 provinces shared their views as well as strengths and weaknesses of the competence-based curriculum. Implicit in the teachers' descriptions of effective curriculum implementation were their perspectives on effective classroom instruction. Such perspectives offer much insight into challenges experienced in curriculum implementation for rural schools. Using teacher agency as a theoretical framework, findings of the study revealed that teachers lack support regarding proper infrastructural facilities, and schools lack human, financial, and material resources for successful curriculum implementation.

Each short case study considers: the political context in which the developments emerged; the ways in which thinking has been framed within the national curriculum, assessment and examination system; and the successes and challenges of the approaches taken to embedding change. Comparing and contrasting three different national systems provides important insights into the priorities, commitments and resources allocated to supporting a focus on thinking as a valued curriculum goal and outcome. In particular, it highlights the need for greater coherence between curriculum, professional development, pedagogy and assessment policies generally.

The problem is twofold: the first difficulty is the relationship to the general issues regarding competence and its assessment; the second difficulty is the assessment of competencies in cross-curricular education in diverse contexts such as school and work. Design/methodology/approach - The European key competence for lifelong learning of the sense of initiative and entrepreneurship and the European qualification framework (EQF) are convenient to benchmark the outcomes of enterprise education. In order to assess and develop competence in vocational students, educators should design real life problem solving situations, which are new for the students and closely related to their vocations. Findings - The study describes an assessment process of the learning outcomes in terms of knowledge, skills and competence. While the authors tested knowledge by giving the students open-ended questions, the authors assessed the skills and competence with a practical problem concerning the students' vocational discipline to be solved in groups. Research limitations/implications - The paper calls for a better alignment between work experience, teaching for competence and assessment of key competences - such as the sense of initiative and entrepreneurship - taught as a cross curricular subject. Originality/value - The assessment makes use of a theoretically grounded definition of competence, and considers varied forms of evaluation of entrepreneurship education. Educators can use it across Europe as it refers to a common background, the European key competences and the EQF, and it promotes the students' transitions to work and mobility. It is rigorous, and, at the same time, adaptable to the context. It is meaningful for the various stakeholders at various levels: students, employers, schools, workplaces and institutions.",,,,,,,,,,,41,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,,2016,58.0,7-8,,,,,797,814,,10.1108/ET-02-2016-0038,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000382546500010

Based on the qualitative case study approach, the analysis of teacher evaluation protocols considered teachers' opinions in the context of achieving learning outcomes with the use of teaching activities and methods. The paper also analyzes teachers' opinions about the required changes in the planning and implementation of the teaching process as well as their professional development. For the learning success to increase, it is important for teachers to emphasize with their competences the organization of pupil-centered activities in achieving learning outcomes that change the approach to the planning of teaching. The focus of contemporary teaching should be on problem solving, active involvement of pupils in the teaching process while respecting the pupils' interests, experiences, needs, motivations, prior knowledge, and expression of creative abilities. The teaching process focuses on constructivist teaching and the conceptual approach using collaborative methods and forms of work, technology in teaching, formative evaluation, and innovative approaches, whose intensity and complexity varies in different circumstances. The results indicate that teachers recognize the potential of a contemporary competence-based approach and pupil-centered learning and teaching by achieving learning outcomes. Emphasis is placed on collaborative methods and forms of work, the introduction of digital technology and autonomy in the selection of content activities.

Design/methodology/approach This qualitative study conducted an explorative experiment to elaborate on forms to advance a pedagogical approach that embeds sustainability. The design of the pedagogical project was explorative and interdisciplinary, using a predefined framework on key competencies for sustainability. Findings The findings showed that an interdisciplinary approach can create a learning setting that stimulates students' problem-solving competencies for sustainability-related issues. Students were trained in the five key sustainable competencies addressed by Wiek et al. (2011). Moreover, although it is not always possible to arrange an interdisciplinary pedagogical setting, this might be a key condition for the development of students' key competencies regarding their understanding of the SDGs. Addressing the SDGs from an interdisciplinary perspective paved the way for the development of students' strategic competencies, including systems thinking and anticipatory competencies. Practical implications The pedagogical project, as an interdisciplinary explorative experiment, was shown to be a potentially suitable method to counteract cherry-picking approaches to teaching the SDGs at HEI.

Advancements in instructional science and educational technologies call for an updated conceptualization of 'flexible thinking' to address current educational challenges. Echoing this need, the goal of this study was to re-conceptualize flexible thinking and to generate a valid and reliable instrument for measuring an individual's inclination to think flexibly in contemporary learning situations. A Six-stage study was designed to assess and validate the new instrument. As a result, the Flexible Thinking in Learning (FTL) scale was generated, consisting of three subscales: Acceptance of new or changing technologies, Open-mindedness to others' ideas, and Adapting to changes in learning situations. Within the framework of the current study, findings confirmed the FTL scale's content, construct, and concurrent validity, indicating stability across populations and over time. Consequently, the FTL scale may serve as both a research instrument and a self-assessment tool. It may assist in the evaluation of learners' inclination to think flexibly or in explaining individual differences regarding the utilization of new learning methods. Yet, generalizability should be carefully considered and additional studies should be conducted to examine the FTL scale among learners from different age groups and academic background.

Questions sought responses related to demographics, the relevance of five sustainability competencies to the participant's employment, the degree to which the five competencies had been developed within the students' project and capabilities participants felt were important to their careers. Findings - Clearly supported was the relevance of all five sustainability competencies, especially that of interpersonal competence. Practical implications - A problem-based learning (PBL) design guided the students' project and the findings indicate that these designs can be effective in delivering the five capabilities discussed. Interpersonal capability appears to be strongly developed, probably because PBL typically involves teamwork, often across disciplines. Nonetheless, those running these PBL-based subjects could note that careful design may be needed to ensure the development of systems thinking, anticipatory and normative capabilities.

Then, critical incidents technique, classroom observations, and focus-group interviews are applied to identify SCC components reflecting real science education contexts. As a result, we develop an SCC model with 10 components and 24 subcomponents.

With greater understanding that social justice and a critical orientation to education are not only important but also the duty of educators to enact (Kubota & Miller, 2017), some advocate the placement of LTI development at the center of language teacher education (LTE; De Costa & Norton, 2017a; Varghese et al., 2016). However, the conceptualization of such intentional models of LTE needs development (Varghese et al., 2016). This article begins to conceptualize such an LTE program.

This paper begins with a definition of key/core skills, followed by a discussion of how they relate to transferable skills. A review of literature regarding the transference of skills from tertiary settings to workplaces in South-East Asia reveals that most literature of the region addresses key competencies rather than the transferable skills that employers value. Transferable skills are further analysed in the context of networked spaces of learning and the theory of connectivist learning. A case study of one networked classroom (NC) of an Australian university in Singapore is presented, highlighting how engagement in problem-based and project-based learning contributes to the development of transferable skills. Results indicate that the spatial and material resources of the NC intersect with practice-based learning experiences assisting students in skills acquisition by providing a teaching and learning space in which to apply transferable skills.

Research on entrepreneurship started in the field of economics, although in recent decades the individual skills and attitudes it involves have become more important and there has been more interest in teaching and learning about the subject. Although some research has found a positive relationship between Entrepreneurship Education (EE) and entrepreneurial behavior, the relationship is not clear and the results are contradictory. The level of entrepreneurial initiative shown prior to any EE seems to be the variable that best explains the different results. Objective: The aim of this paper is to determine which individual differences can best identify those university students with a strong entrepreneurial attitude. Method: The sample was made up of 514 students from six Spanish universities, who were divided into two groups corresponding to individuals with high and low entrepreneurial intention. A step-by-step logistic regression analysis was performed resulting in a model in which the variables of emotional repair, low neuroticism and agreeableness were significant. Results: This model allows us to correctly forecast 62.20% of cases. Discussion: These findings are important for work on models that allow us to identify the profiles of potential entrepreneurs.

It investigates whether mindfulness training can cultivate the ability to introspect and stimulate the development of KCSCs. Design/methodology/approach Two independent studies were analyzed. Data were retrieved from interviews with participants of a consumer-focused mindfulness training (Study 1, 11 participants), as well as from diaries of students attending a university seminar with mindfulness training (Study 2, 13 students), and made subject to qualitative content analysis. Findings Both studies show a clear intersection between both constructs and suggest that mindfulness training can contribute to the development of KCSCs and learners' ability to introspect. The studies also demonstrated that introspection is not equally related to all competencies and that KCSCs must not be reduced to introspection. Research limitations/implications - Both KCSCs and introspection are complex and latent constructs and hence challenging to observe. The research understands itself as a first exploratory approach for empirically investigating this complex relation. Originality/value While increasing (self-)reflectivity is at the core of competence-based education, a systematic engagement with the practice of introspection as a means to enhancing reflectivity is surprisingly lacking.

A subset of 108 written test-answers were subjected to an explorative analysis focusing on generic and professional writing competencies. A more text-based and trans-contextual working life for many professions requires not only profession-specific communicative competency, but also a stronger engagement in generic literacy practices. The need for written communication with customers, clients and colleagues across workplaces and countries has increased and the use of understandable language when communicating with non-peers is required.

A competence can be defined as an integrated and stable network of knowledge and know-how, with normative behaviors, procedures and types of reasoning. However, without a theoretical conceptualization of building and mobilization processes, the components of a competence are considered as isolated and not interconnected. In the health and physical education (HPE) setting, too few empirical studies have analyzed how teachers would contribute to the development of student's competence. The aim of this forward-looking article grounded on an experiential and cultural framework consists in clarifying and illustrating a conceptualization of the dynamics of development of competences among students considering the teacher activity. This theoretical framework seems to offer heuristic possibilities for the examination of teaching and learning practices which contribute to the development of the key competences, particularly when a competence is read as an experience that integrates multiple dimensions. Based on audio-video recording of PE lessons and self-confrontation interviews with the teacher and a student, the results of the present study strengthen the criticism of the definition of competence emphasizing the relevance to adopt a holistic approach corresponding to the articulation of intertwined resources (i.e. motor, methodological and social) students allocate to act in PE groups. Furthermore, the results show that the competence building depends on various roles students have the opportunity to play in PE (i.e. observer, tutor). Finally, our results underline the importance of identifying the specific characteristics of the teacher activity designed to structure the learning environment to train students to acquire new competences transferable in society.",,,,,,,,,,,30,10,10,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 4,2019,24.0,4,,,,,390,403,,10.1080/13573322.2017.1397507,,,,"Education & Educational Research; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism; Sport Sciences",,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000462033900006

Until now, OIC has been explored in the young entrepreneurship research field. However, entrepreneurship researchers until now have not fully explored OIC. According to several authors, the research on complex problem solving (CPS) in the cognitive research field might contribute to understanding OIC. In this paper, we review the link between OIC and CPS by comparing the cognitive and entrepreneurship research fields. We argue that those who excel in identifying opportunities share core characteristics with high-level complex problem-solvers. We propose to conduct empirical research in the future to investigate the relation between OIC and CPS within a work context in order to gain more insight into OIC.

This has led to calls for increased competencies of teachers. Testing, assessment and evaluation have previously been a central practice of educational psychologists but it is now expected to be a key competence of all teachers and other professionals working in schools.

Project-based learning has become a widely recommended pedagogy for sustainability education. It is hypothesized that through collaboration, student autonomy and real-world application, students develop key competencies for sustainability. This paper also aims to examine the connection between project-based learning and competence development on a program level from the student perspective. Design/methodology/approach This two-year comparative case study follows the project-based-learning journeys of nine graduate sustainability students from three programs: the Master's of Sustainability at Arizona State University, the Master's of Sustainability Science at Leuphana University of Luneburg and the Global Sustainability Science Master's, an ASU and Leuphana collaboration. Over four semesters, the students each took part in four competence-oriented self-assessments and interviews to map their perceived learning throughout their programs. Additional contextual information was gathered from program and course materials and descriptions, instructor interviews and in vivo observations. Findings The defining aspects of project-based learning including collaboration, student autonomy and real-world connection do contribute to students' self-perceived competence development. Student-driven and program-driven project-based learning experiences equally foster this result, as long as the pedagogical challenges of balancing support and student independence associated with each are mitigated through instructor actions, program design or individual student coping skills. Originality/value The results of this research can support higher education institutions in designing sustainability programs aimed at competence development through project-based learning. The focus on the curricular and program level combined with repeated overtime student-reported attribution to specific courses and activities bridges the gap between individual course case studies and theoretical recommendations for curriculum design.

Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual paper explores a new learning strategy to promote the Relational University. This exploration designs an experimental infrastructure named SIE. This infrastructure promotes the link between work-based learning and social innovation to develop four key competencies: heuristic, epistemic, relational and experimental skills. Findings - There is little attention in the literature about work-based learning and social innovation. The conceptual framework provides a program on Social Innovation Capitalization (SIC) in the framework of the SIE.

It is emphasized that the need to prepare students with twenty-firstcentury skills through STEM-related teaching is strong, especially at the elementary level. The authors present selected previous experiences, publications, research into the study topic, and review examples of primary school robotics and programming curricula, as well as associated educational activities. The authors stress that workshops, using kits to build and programme robots, are a modern form of interdisciplinary education of children and youth. Design/methodology/approach - The rationale for conducting such activities in schools is found in the European reference framework in the context of training of key competences. Classes in robotics - if properly taught - will have an impact on the development of mathematical literacy and scientific-technical information and social competences. At the same time, competence is understood to mean a combination of knowledge, skills and attitudes appropriate to the situation. Besides, an analysis is presented of basic legal regulations in this matter as well as results of a survey, conducted in Poland and Ukraine among in-service teachers and prospective teachers. Findings - The study was carried out with the participation of 91 primary school teachers and future teachers in the province of Silesia and at the University of Silesia in Poland, and in Ukraine, at Borys Grinchenko Kyiv University. The survey contained 15 questions about the pedagogical research Robotics and children. The study was carried out to determine the needs of modern education to introduce the basics of robotics in the educational process of primary school.

However, the 2008-2009 revision of the Course of Study (the national curriculum in Japan) shows that the Japanese government was really concerned about the decline of Japan's ranking in the previous PISA assessments and revised the Course of Study in response to children's skills which the PISA aimed to measure (key competencies).

Design/methodology/approach - The paper builds upon a constructivist approach, combining a literature review, a desk research on key publications and reports and a socio-political analysis to reveal the specific context in Flanders, Belgium. Findings are then connected to earlier insights from research on organisational change for sustainability. Findings - The paper provides a number of PD initiatives that focus on sustainability in general and in a single higher education (HE) institution. Framing such initiatives as an organisational change process offers insights on how elements of empowerment are currently incorporated in PD initiatives and how it can strengthen them to lead to the further integration of sustainability competences in HE. Research limitations/implications - Limitations are linked with the kind of sources used in the constructivist approach. The analysis only looks at written reports on the topic, albeit it also builds upon the first-hand experiences of educators in the HE institution focused upon in the case. Practical implications - There is a need to frame PD initiatives as an organisational change process towards sustainability with specific attention towards empowerment. Without this framing, PD approaches comprise the risk of being left in the margins or being understood as single initiatives without any connection to the bigger picture, i.e. the transition towards sustainability in HE. Social implications - Interlinking PD and organisational change provides opportunities to frame the sustainability transition within the university in a wider societal context.

Young people have the opportunity to bring about desirable changes through environmental behaviours and attitudes. The goal of this study is to better understand the scope of nature relatedness as an attribution interacting with pro-environmental behaviours for Turkish pre-service early childhood teachers. We examined the associations between the domains representing nature relatedness and also sought to identify any differences in nature relatedness with respect to their year of enrolment in a teacher education program. The participants were 402 students attending an Early Childhood Teacher Education Program at one of the two public universities in the capital of Turkey. A Turkish-adapted version of the Nature Relatedness Scale developed by Nisbet, Zelenski, and Murphy was administered to gather the data. Participants were found to have a mostly positive external nature-related worldview. Furthermore, the statistical analysis indicated non-significant differences in their nature relatedness with respect to the year of enrolment in the teacher education program. In terms of the relationships between the constructs representing nature relatedness, the internalized identification with nature was positively correlated with two constructs which refer to his/her physical familiarity as well as attraction to nature, and how individual's relationship with the environment is provoked by his/her behaviour. This research indicates that pre-service teachers, who are regarded as important agents for the future implementation of sustainability education, are actually lacking in their nature relatedness constructs and need to develop key competencies in a field that presupposes that they have already acquired sufficient experience of physical and emotional interaction with nature.",,,,,,,,,,,63,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2,2019,28.0,4,,,,,343,357,,10.1080/10382046.2019.1651040,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000490544600007

Since the process of language acquisition does not only include acquiring linguistic and communicative elements but also developing psychosocial skills, L1 communication is emphasized as the first and most important out of eight key competences in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Vijece Europe, 2005). Therefore, all the participants within the educational process are expected to encourage the development of language competences - firstly communicative and then linguistic competence. A child enters the language communication process by means of listening and imitating adult speakers of a language community, after which the processes of repetition and understanding, and the act of speaking are triggered. After finishing preschool, school-age children develop more complex language skills such as reading and writing. However, the basic skills of listening and speaking should still not be neglected. Unfortunately, the teaching experience and scientific research (Aladrovio-Slovaek, 2011; Cvikic, Pavlicevic-Franic, & Aladrovic-Slovacek, 2015; Jelaska, 2005; Pavlicevic-Franic, 2005, 2011) point to the fact that it is precisely the basic language skills of listening and speaking that are not being sufficiently included in the teaching process. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to articulate the immense importance of the receptive skill of listening and the productive skill of speaking within the process of learning and teaching Croatian, since they are the basic linguistic skills necessary both for acquiring the Croatian language and other school subjects.",,,,,,,,,,,21,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2018,20.0,,,,2,,287,308,,10.15516/cje.v20i0.2322,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000454544700011

Thus, science education should reflect the trend of social development and prepare students to think about and make wise decisions on major social topics related to science. As an aspect of the societal dimension of science, socio-scientific topics (SSTs) have a great influence on social development. In order to prepare students to participate in modern social life effectively, shape the society in a sustainable way, and become responsible citizens in the future, what major SSTs should science curriculum relevant to students and the society focus on? In this study, the famous forecasting method, the Delphi method, was used to explore the above-mentioned question. Thirty-three experts who came from Chinese universities and scientific research institutes were invited to make effective decisions based on the backgrounds of social development and students' all-round development demands during a three-stage Delphi process. The results showed that six level-one SSTs that referred to the generalized and superior socio-scientific fields and thirty corresponding level-two SSTs that referred to their specific and inferior topics achieved consensus and should be emphasized in the science curriculum. The six level-one SSTs are environmental issues, safety and health, resources and energy, ecological system, biotechnology, and new materials.

Specific focus is oriented towards strengthening research competences for sustainability. Design/methodology/approach - Following a hermeneutic-interpretive methodology, this paper builds upon a critical literature review to demarcate the theoretical framework and an in-depth analysis of a case study exploring the interrelations between both types of competences. Findings - The paper discusses current issues in the integration of competences and explores the contribution of research-based methods to acquire competences for sustainable development. The analysis shows that research skills are often mentioned to contribute to this acquisition, though from a general perspective, or from the sidelines of the learning process. A holistic view on how both concepts are linked is missing. Research limitations/implications - First, the complex nature of competences and their integration in higher education could lead to difficulties in interpreting and analysing them. Second, the analysis is based on a single-case study, limiting possibilities to generalise the results. Third, this study is not looking at curriculum practices in these fields. Practical implications - There is a need to holistically (re-) frame research competences within the concepts of education for sustainable development and, to a wider extent, sustainable development. Social implications - Framing research competences within the concept of sustainable development enables a thorough and conscious, rather than coincidental, acquisition of competences for sustainable development.

The present-day education system has failed to nurture the kind of creative people who can play leading roles in development or to produce citizens of a good character and democratic tendencies. We need to look at education from the standpoint of expanding the totality of possibilities for national development. The current educational system of Korea can be characterized as one of manpower-centered education. In this system, education functions to produce the human resources needed by the nation, and there is a strong belief in the classification and selection of high-quality human capital via the school system. We can think of an educational model that is parallel to the current system of manpower classification and selection and call it competency-based education. In this model, the identification of individual ability, talent, and aptitude is deemed to be the most important, and the key task of education is self-actualization through recognition and cultivation of such talents and abilities. What educational values should be pursued within a new competency-based paradigm? First, we can reduce the relative weight of subject-centered education and introduce a competency-based curriculum in order to teach key competences for life. Second, new intelligence theories must be introduced into education in order to foster the development of students' talents, aptitudes, and potentials. Third, we can make use of positive psychology, which is a newly emerging field, the core concept of which is the belief that happiness in life depends on one's ability to develop and maintain positive feelings and emotions.",,,,,,,,,,,29,24,25,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2007,8.0,2,,,,,337,341,,10.1007/BF03029267,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000249166100016

The paper is framed in a theoretical approach, viewing students' participation in scientific practices, and the development of higher-order thinking as necessary goals of science education. We argue that the focus on competencies, characterized as the ability to apply knowledge and skills in new contexts, involves a major change towards knowledge transfer and higher-order thinking skills. Some issues emerging from the analysis relate to the implications of assessment criteria and the challenges involved in its implementation, to the trends in teacher professional development and the difficulties related to the current economic crisis and to the results of the diagnostic evaluation and time frame needed for reforms to have an impact.

The communication recognizes active citizenship as one of the four broad and mutually supporting objectives of the lifelong learning strategy. Accordingly, civic competence, which equips individuals to fully participate in civic life, has been identified by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union as a key competence to be given priority in all member states in the years to come. The article introduces the core principles of a European study aiming at investigating, from a comparative perspective, ways in which adults can achieve competencies relevant for democratic citizenship. Furthermore it presents and discusses selected of findings. The findings suggest that, in spite of the shift from education to learning for democratic citizenship within the European discourse, the emphasis on lifelong learning and the consequent equal recognition of in-school and out-of-school learning activities, most empirical research in the field of education for democratic citizenship remains primarily concerned with school-aged pupils.

To date lyrics of popular English songs could serve not only as a source of information but as an instrument to form an ideology, system of values or attitudes of young people all over the world. The attention is paid to allusions performing in the song lyrics of Pink and Lady Gaga. An allusion is an indirect reference, by word or phrase, to a historical, literary, mythological, biblical fact or to a fact of everyday life that authors assume the listeners know as their background knowledge, but non-native speakers lack this. Therefore the aim of this paper is to show how allusion analysis in song lyrics helps to learn the American and British culture. In developing this paper, the authors analyzed existing theories on allusions, examined song lyrics of famous performers for the presence of this stylistic device. This analysis provided the theoretical foundation for proposing the most common types of allusions in Pink and Lady Gaga song lyrics. The authors used a theoretical approach in drawing on existing literature to advance theory in the areas of stylistics, lingua culture, developing key competences and English language learning. The article presents the authors' conclusion that the most common types of allusions in Pink and Lady Gaga song lyrics can be contingently divided into three groups: religious (biblical) allusions with different semantic and emotional coloring; allusions to the social facts and allusions to the political facts. Most of them are linked to external and internal policy of the United States. It should be noted that the allusions by these performers refer to cross-cultural issues. So for adequate recognition of the majority of allusions, it is essential to have a social and cultural competences and knowledge of the various phenomena of the United States and modern Britain. Allusion analysis in Pink song lyrics shows through her songs it is possible to learn global social and political topics. Songs by Lady Gaga reveals the modern US world of business, fashion, and glamor - so-called Burlesque time.

The paper argues that achieving this weaving in the science learning area requires an understanding of the nature and importance of epistemic thinking. Epistemic thinking is pivotal to interpreting the Nature of Science (NOS) strand of the science learning area in ways that support learning outcomes related to informed participation in society (i.e. citizenship competencies). Such current and future participation is signalled as important by NZC. However creating a learning programme congruent with this intent requires schools and teachers to undertake a sophisticated weaving of the various high-level NZC components with the strands and sub-strands of the science learning area. Since many classroom teachers are unlikely to possess the knowledge about science that is needed, or even to be aware that there is 'something more' to thinking competencies that they should be addressing, the provision of appropriate forms of professional learning support is vital. Without such support thinking in general, and epistemic thinking in particular, is likely to remain 'everywhere and nowhere' as a specific outcome of science learning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It further investigates to what extent such competences can affect students' belief in the new environmental paradigm (NEP) and pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs). Design/methodology/approach The data was collected through an online survey conducted in 2021 among the students of an international research university based in The Netherlands. The final sample (N = 262) consisted of all the students who completed the survey and claimed that they had taken at least one course that addressed sustainability. Linear regression models were used to examine the relationship of sustainability education and students' competences, as well as their pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. Findings The findings reveal that the strength of universal, broadly applicable pedagogies is positively related to the development of students' sustainability mindset/framework as well as their sustainability action/communication. The results also reveal that developing students' competences on sustainability mindset/framework is directly related to their belief in the NEP and PEBs. Originality/value To develop an integrative pedagogical approach requires understanding how a HEI's engagement in sustainability can impact students' attitudes and behaviors, but little research has actually measured the development of students' competences. This study fills this gap through empirically testing how different pedagogical approaches can affect students' sustainability competences differently.

This assessment is to be officially introduced in August 2014. Novice members of a national rater panel to assess Year 8 pupils' texts were studied during three of their successive training sessions: in June 2011, November 2011 and April 2012. My purpose was to conduct an exploratory investigation into how the rating practice of novice raters might develop during such a preparatory stage. The raters in this study mainly assessed in pairs, and data sources were assessment dialogues. The analysis of transcripts showed that rater behaviour changed only to a minor extent towards an increased use of shared assessment resources. The quality of the assessment dialogues did not change much either, leaving the impression that raters often reached consensus without much discussion. Since reliable scoring is a collective task, however, it is argued that a more balanced use of resources, both those attained from teacher practice and those attained from being a member of a national panel, may together with more exploration-oriented dialogue be necessary to achieve sufficient reliability.

Teachers have to understand peculiarities of organizing such a game form of activity in a digital school. The purpose of the study is to theoretically prove and experimentally test the effectiveness of using mobile game applications in the quest genre in order to form necessary competencies of future specialists in a digital school environment. The research methodology is the analysis and synthesis of psychological and pedagogical work, methods of mathematical statistics, and methods of psychodiagnostics. The pedagogical experiment of the study is the assessment of the formation of basic competences which provide the base in the field of computer science, cybernetics and artificial intelligence required by the state and society. Results of the study. The study proves the didactic potential of mobile applications which are able to support the quest technology in order to achieve high-priority objectives in the project Digital School. The authors describe ideas of the methodical approach, which reflect the necessary changes in the support of students' cognitive activity through mobile game applications in the quest genre. The study shows levels of differentiation of education depending on the individual and age characteristics of students and the choice of digital means. The authors prove that the quest technology, focused work to solve education tasks, motivates future professional activities, and also with the help of modern digital means, contributes to the development of such necessary cross-professional competencies of future specialists as project activities, systems thinking, interaction and interindustry communication. In conclusion, the authors confirm that the inclusion of mobile game applications in the quest genre in education activities will help to form key competencies and skills that meet the priorities of the digital school and are most in demand by society.",,,,,,,,,,,36,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2019,8.0,3,,,,,613,626,,10.13187/ejced.2019.3.613,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000486437000014

The competence to handle this heterogeneity - the so-called intercultural competence - is a key competence for all children and youths. Sports and physical education (PE) are often considered as a particular field for enhancing intercultural competence. However, until now there is no theory-based empirical study that proves this assumption. Purpose: This study was designed to examine the effects of a standardised, theoretically driven programme in PE on the development of underlying cognitive concepts of intercultural competence: acculturation attitudes and attitudes towards cultural diversity. Research design: The research design consists of a quasi-experimental design with four measurement points. The intervention group (N=69; mean age=11.6 years (SD=0.60)) followed standardised and theory-driven intervention lessons following the didactical guidelines of the concept of Intercultural Movement Education' (IME). The developed games tend to trigger crises' with the aim to insecure students. These experienced insecurities were afterwards reflected upon with the students. The internal control group (N=63; mean age=11.8 years (SD=0.62)) and external control group (N=93; mean age=10.8 years (SD=0.69)) were taught in a unspecific manner. The impact of the intervention study programme was tested with a reliable and valid questionnaire. Results: A significant time by group interaction effect for the subscale assimilation/segregation' of acculturation attitudes was found in boys and in girls. The attitudes increased significantly after the intervention. For the girls, the intervention group showed also a significant decrease of the attitude integration'. No significant impact of the intervention study on the attitudes towards cultural diversity could be identified either with boys or girls. Discussion: The effects of the study are ambivalent. The significantly increased assimilative attitudes can be interpreted as a need for a sense of security. This is also underlined by the decrease of the integration attitude that values the maintenance of cultural integrity. It must be critically discussed whether the crises' were too intense and not adapted to the children's skills to overcome them. Second, we have to critically analyse whether the discussions with the students about their experiences were sufficiently focused to debrief the students. Summary for practitioners: The competence to handle heterogeneity - the so-called intercultural competence - is a key competence for children and youths. Sports and PE are often considered as a particular field for enhancing intercultural competence. However, until now there has been no theory-based empirical study that proves this assumption. This paper describes the development, implementation and evaluation of an intervention programme on intercultural learning in PE along the didactic guidelines of IME. This programme tries to trigger crises' that stimulate the students to react and think about their self- and world relations. The statistical analyses show that the crises' were probably too intense as the students' scores in assimilation attitudes increased.

We then summarise and compare a qualitative investigation of RadioActive101. This showed positive results, with important similarities and differences between the two contexts. Participants reported that RadioActive101 was motivating and contributed to the development of contemporary skills, and also stimulated improvements in psychosocial dimensions such as confidence (self-efficacy) and self-esteem. This investigation informed the development of an original recognition system for non-formal learning that maps EU Key Competences for Lifelong Learning to radio practices and activities that are recognised through electronic badges.

J,"Benade, L",,,,"Benade, Leon",,,Shame: Does it have a place in an education for democratic citizenship?,EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY,,,,Article,,,,,,democratic citizenship; virtues education; reintegrative shaming; restorative justice; shame,GUILT,"Shame, shame management and reintegrative shaming feature in some restorative justice literature, and may have implications for schools. Restorative justice in schools is effective when perpetrators of wrong-doing can accept and take ownership of their wrongful acts, are appropriately remorseful, and seek to make amends. Shame may be understood as an ethical matter if it is regarded to arise because of the contradiction between the wrongful act and the individual's sense of self and self-worth. Shame management (that is, seeking reintegrative over stigmatising shaming) can be regarded to reflect a form of social responsibility as it contributes to community restoration by repairing ruptured social relationships. The notion of shaming and acknowledgement of harm thus assumes norms of acceptable community behaviour, attitudes and relationships, and is therefore also an ethical matter. Successful restorative practices in schools depend on the school-wide existence and practice of such norms, and mesh with virtues education, stimulated by the contemporary demand of many national curricula to promote so-called key competencies. Although the concepts of restorative justice and reintegrative shaming serve as a context for this article, its chief impetus was provided by an evaluative study of a group of New Zealand schools, in the course of which notions such as shame, reintegration and exclusion became evident. The chief purpose of this article is to consider and problematise shame from the perspective of the philosophy of education, and ask whether the concept of shame has a place in schools, whose important aims ought to include the development of democratic citizenship.",,,,,,,,,,,37,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 7,2015,47.0,7,,,,,661,674,,10.1080/00131857.2014.880644,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000354776100003

Learning techniques can improve academic success and help students cope with stressors. To support students' learning process medical faculties should know about learning techniques. The purpose of this study is to analyse the preferred learning techniques of female and male as well as junior and senior medical students and how these learning techniques are related to perceived learning difficulties. Methods In 2019, we conducted an online survey with students of the undergraduate, competency-based curriculum of medicine at Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin. We chose ten learning techniques of high, moderate and low utility according to Dunlosky et al. (2013) and we asked medical students to rate their preferred usage of those techniques using a 5-point Likert scale. We applied t-tests to show differences in usage between female and male as well as junior and senior learners. Additionally, we conducted a multiple regression analysis to explore the predictive power of learning techniques regarding perceived difficulties. Results A total of 730 medical students (488 women, 242 men, M-age = 24.85, SD = 4.49) use three techniques the most: 'highlighting' (low utility), 'self-explanation' (moderate utility) and 'practice testing' (high utility). Female students showed a significantly higher usage of low-utility learning techniques (t(404.24) = -7.13, p < .001) and a higher usage of high-utility learning techniques (t(728) = -2.50, p < .05) than male students (M = 3.55, SD = .95). Compared to junior students (second to sixth semester; M = 3.65, SD = .71), senior students (seventh semester to final clerkship year; M = 3.52, SD = .73) showed a lower use of low-utility learning techniques (t(603) = 2.15, p < .05). Usage of low-utility techniques is related to more difficulties (beta = .08, t(724) = 2.13, p < .05). Usage of moderate-utility techniques is related to less learning difficulties (beta = -.13, t(599) = -3.21, p < .01). Conclusions Students use a wide range of low-, moderate- and high-utility learning techniques. The use of learning techniques has an influence on the difficulties perceived by students. Therefore, they could benefit from knowing about and using high-utility learning techniques to facilitate their learning.

Learning a language is more than just acquiring knowledge about a new linguistic norm and its rules: it is above all, a vehicle for communication, an open channel to the world and a new scope with which new cultures are explored and different views and perspectives are discovered and shared. This paper aims at exploring task-based learning approach for language instruction and presenting a study on the benefits attributed to this approach, relating them to existing trends in current educational innovation.

Ocean i3 is a cross-border project with the aim of achieving sustainability in the oceans by training students to become environmentally concerned and responsible professionals. This study explores the perception of students and teachers regarding their participation in Ocean i3 and their understanding of employability. A qualitative methodological approach has been used, based on a case study in which semi-structured interviews have been carried out and the Elevator Pitch presentation technique has been applied. Nine students and four teachers from the University of the Basque Country and the University of Bordeaux have been interviewed. The results highlight the importance of the participants' first contact with the project, the need to be explicit regarding competences that favour employability during the development of the experience, and the need to increase and reinforce internships at social entities located in the territory.

However, some studies highlight teachers' difficulties to integrate it in a classroom context. For instance, introducing creativity in overloaded school curricula may be a hindrance to developing it. Teachers have to implement other 21st-century competencies (the 4Cs) at the same time as well. These educational objectives can be considerable in terms of time and means for teachers and thus do not encourage them to develop these competencies. The purpose of this article is to present links, essentially theoretical, made by researchers between creativity and other 21st-century skills (e.g., critical thinking, metacognition, and collaboration). We considered that if creativity shares some characteristics with other competencies, it can be possible that, by applying only a teaching-for-creativity approach in classroom, we can also contribute to developing the other C as well. So choosing only creativity can be a way for teachers to develop their pupils' skills without falling behind in their curriculum. In this article, we will also discuss our hypothesis taking into account limits from teachers' classroom practices.

There has been growing interest in the intersection between performance and cognitive science (McConachie, B., and H. E. Hart, eds. 2006.

This paper will analyse the ambiguities inherent in stage images of contested cities to explore how these may reveal unconscious insights into the image-makers' perception of their home environments. An image of Sarajevo, for instance, ostensibly about the Winter Olympics, prompts consideration of the city's internal divisions. An image of Belfast, ostensibly about the Titanic, suggests the limitations of the city's Peace Process. Taking Boal's idea that stage images should be felt rather than read, this article explores the fine line between feeling and meaning in the understanding of Image Theatre and suggests that alongside literacy and orality we now also need to include imageracy', the ability to interpret and understand images, as a key competency for the modern world.",,,,,,,,,,,15,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2017,22.0,2,,,,,186,201,,10.1080/13569783.2017.1286977,,,,Education & Educational Research; Theater,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000399927200002

Just under half of the universities' statements contained references to sustainability, while all the literature derived sustainability capabilities, except for systems/holistic thinking, are represented to some degree. Those most strongly represented included understanding of social justice and equity; skills in communication and cooperation; and having commitment to social justice and equity. Practical implications - Apparently, in Australian universities, the framework for the development of sustainability capabilities is broadly in place, but not all have sustainability capabilities in place.

The result of this trend is the modification in the Polish education system of the IT subjects' core curriculum, under which teaching programming is planned at every stage of education. While teaching the skills of programming is important, it is not an easy task to achieve and hence it poses many methodological challenges. Researchers in this field are increasingly turning to new experimental methods, such as eye tracking techniques that allow to gain an insight into cognitive mechanisms and thus can provide objective information about the process of learning programming. The article discusses the results of authors' own study, in which the state of declarative and procedural knowledge of students related to the forms of algorithm presentation was diagnosed. The questionnaires along with the tasks included in them, which the students solved in a traditional way and with the means of eye tracking techniques, were used in the study to track the process of solving comparable tasks presented on a computer monitor. The indicator of operational knowledge was the effectiveness of problem solving. The research was conducted on a group of 48 third-grade junior secondary school students. The obtained results (low level of correct answers) indicate that the situation in the area of learning the algorithmic skills of students requires improvement. The measurement data obtained using eye tracking allowed for an in-depth analysis and interpretation of visual activity of students. Therefore, it seems that eye tracking can be considered as a complementary research technique, enriching the state of knowledge on cognitive mechanisms that are triggered in the process of solving algorithmic problems.",,,,,,,,,,,22,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,2018,,2,,,,,10,18,,10.15219/em74.1347,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000448466400003
J,"Hipkins, R; Bull, A",,,,"Hipkins, Rosemary; Bull, Ally",,,Science capabilities for a functional understanding of the nature of science,CURRICULUM MATTERS,,,,Article,,,,,,,LITERACY,"This article begins by making the case that the New Zealand curriculum component known as the Nature of Science (NOS) has generally not, thus far, achieved its stated intent of helping students think differently about science and its relevance to their lives. We argue that NOS components in curricula have tended to become positioned as additional content to be learned, at least partly as a consequence of well-meaning curriculum support initiatives that aim to build teachers' own NOS knowledge. The result is that NOS is added to an already overburdened curriculum, potentially making science even more abstract and inaccessible for some students than it already is. Having outlined the nature of the problem, we then describe a recent initiative that endeavoured to address the NOS challenge in a different way. We began by asking how a NOS focus might contribute to changes in teaching and learning that more deliberately focus on supporting students to build their science capabilities so that they can become the informed citizens that The New Zealand Curriculum (NZC) identifies as the overarching goal for science learning. This curriculum initiative introduces science capabilities as a set of ideas for teachers to think with. The capabilities were derived from the intersection of the generic key competencies in NZC, the NOS strand from the science learning area, and the NZC purpose statement for learning science, which emphasises citizenship. However, as we outline in the final section of the article, it is proving very hard to expand views of learning as content acquisition to include the participatory sensibility that the addition of capabilities implies. The idea of capabilities makes intuitive sense to teachers but using them as classroom prompts to think more deeply about NOS with their students is still a work in progress.",,,,,,,,,,,29,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,2015,11.0,,,,,,117,133,,10.18296/cm.0007,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000377607400007

Teaching students about unacknowledged feedback loops in complex systems should prevent them from choosing the most obvious intervention without considering unwanted side effects.The current study aims to report the effects of teaching a systems perspective, applied to transport systems, on students' opinions and expressed paradigms. The following questions are addressed: Do students adhere to the techno-centric paradigm, believing technology, innovation and growth can solve all types of threats for sustainable development, while neglecting low probability, high impact events? Are paradigms held by students coherent? Can teaching lead to a change in opinions and paradigms held by students? Design/methodology/approach - Measures for several systems concepts (i.e. functional stupidity, paradigms and fragility) are taken across a wide sample of university students. Posttests of some key items are taken for a subsample that followed a sustainability and systems perspective in a course on transport economics. Findings - A large share of students think that technology can solve different types of problems in sustainable development (a kind of weak sustainability), but their paradigms tend to be a mix of conflicting opinions. Though student opinions on topics that were explicitly treated in the course have changed, neither a wider paradigm shift nor significantly more coherent paradigms can be confirmed.

Research increasingly acknowledges that medical students in clerkships need others to regulate their learning. The concept of co-regulated learning captures this act of regulating one's learning by interacting with others. To effectively cultivate such skills in students, we need to increase our understanding of co-regulated learning. This study aimed to identify the purposes for which students in different phases of clinical training engage others in their networks to regulate their learning. Methods In this social network study, we administered a questionnaire to 403 medical students during clinical clerkships (65.5% response rate). The questionnaire probed into the composition of students' co-regulatory networks and the purpose for which they engaged others in specified self-regulated learning activities. We calculated the proportion of students that engaged others in their networks for each regulatory activity. Additionally, we conducted ANOVAs to examine whether first-, second-, and third-year students differed in how they used their networks to support self-regulation. Results Students used others within their co-regulatory networks to support a range of self-regulated learning activities. Whom students engaged, and the purpose of engagement, seemed to shift as students progressed through clinical training. Over time, the proportion of students engaging workplace supervisors to discuss learning goals, learning strategies, self-reflections and self-evaluations increased, whereas the proportion of students engaging peers to discuss learning strategies and how to work on learning goals in the workplace decreased. Of all purposes for which students engaged others measured, discussing self-reflections and self-evaluations were consistently among the ones most frequently mentioned. Conclusions Results reinforce the notion that medical students' regulation of learning is grounded in social interactions within co-regulatory networks students construct during clerkships. Findings elucidate the extent to which students enact self-regulatory learning within their co-regulatory networks and how their co-regulatory learning behaviors develop over time.

Design/methodology/approach - The effects of the EYE tool are analyzed by means of questionnaires. Through a qualitative codification process and quantitative analysis, the authors have reflected on the effects of the EYE tool and on the empowerment process as perceived by the students exposed to the EYE at Wageningen University. Findings - Results suggest that the EYE is a comprehensive and adaptive tool, conducive to empowerment for sustainability. Adopting, only partly, an instrumental approach to education and, largely, an emancipatory one appears to be a possible and successful combination. Akey aspect contributing to students' empowerment for sustainability is the development and execution of a real-life project of own choice.

Existing higher education sustainability assessment tools rarely focus on the curriculum. This paper aims to establish and implement a tool that can measure sustainability integration within curriculum. The Faculty of Engineering and IT (FEIT) at University of Technology Sydney (UTS) is used as a case study. Design/methodology/approach A set of seven sustainability competencies are identified by means of a systematic literature review as the current knowledge of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) competencies. ESD competency integration into the curriculum is assessed by implementing a two-tier scanning mechanism. In the first step, subject outlines (SOs) are used to identify sustainable subject learning outcomes (SLOs) and assessment learning outcomes (ALOs). Step 2 involves analysing ALOs and SLOs for constructive alignment with student experience. SPSS, a statistical software, is then used to statistically reflect the results. Findings An initial scan of SOs found that stated ESD outcomes made up 22.4 per cent of FEIT undergraduate courses. A more detailed investigation which involved assessing subject material and student experience for the seven ESD outcomes resulted in a 7.7 per cent sustainability integration into the FEIT undergraduate courses. SPSS produced tables showing individual competency distribution over course candidature year. Lifecycle assessment was invisible from the curriculum. Research limitations/implications Case study outcomes are limited to UTS, and therefore, specific-study outcomes cannot be generalised. This study attempted to trace sustainability learning outcomes through the curriculum. However, a more detailed study should also assess subject pedagogy and artefacts as these may enable or inhibit sustainability competency. Originality/value Study developed several methods to establish and evaluate subject level ESD claims.

As models of school development and school effectiveness found teacher professionalization to be a key element with regards to student achievement as well as teachers' in-class use of new technology, the present research project conducts secondary analyses using data from the lEA International Computer and Information Literacy Study 2013 (ICILS 2013) regarding internal and external teacher professionalization. Particular emphasis is placed on the implementation of new technologies in class in a comparison between the education systems of Germany and the Czech Republic. A Latent Class Analysis serves the purpose of establishing a teacher typology with regards to technology-related professional development. This typology is subsequently used for further analyses of additional factors that show a correlation with the teachers' use of computers in class. These include the teachers' ICT self-efficacy and their emphasis on teaching ICT skills. The results show two different types of teachers across both countries. Teachers who participate in professional development use computers more frequently in class, put more emphasis on teaching ICT skills and have a stronger sense of ICT self-efficacy.

Until now, research on problem solving focused on the relationship between analytical and complex problem solving, but rarely took into account the structure of problem-solving processes and metacognitive aspects. This paper, therefore, presents a theoretical framework, which describes the relationship between the components of problem solving and strategy knowledge. In order to assess the constructs, we developed a virtual environment which allows students to solve interactive and static problems. 162 students of grade 10 and the upper secondary level completed the tests within a cross-sectional survey. In order to investigate the structure of problem-solving competency, we established measurement models representing different theoretical assumptions, and evaluated model fit statistics by using confirmatory factor analyses. Results show that problem-solving competency in virtual environments comprises to three correlated abilities: achieving a goal state, systematical handling of variables, and solving analytical tasks. Furthermore, our study provides empirical evidence on the distinction between analytical and complex problem solving. Additionally, we found significant differences between students of grades 10 and 12 within the problem-solving subscales, which could be explained by gaming experience and prior knowledge. These findings are discussed from a measurement perspective. Implications for assessing complex problem solving are given. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, so far it is difficult to assess individual's cognitive workload independently from performance to adapt learning environments accordingly. In the present study, we aim at identifying learners' cognitive workload induced by addition tasks of varying difficulty using electroencephalography (EEG). To this end, a classifier using specific features in the EEG-signal is trained to differentiate between different levels of task difficulty significantly above chance level and with high consistency over all participants. Importantly, our model even allows for the prediction of cognitive demands induced by the addition tasks in a cross-participant approach. Closer inspection of the crucial EEG features indicates that oscillations in the theta and alpha band recorded from parietal electrodes are most reflective of current task difficulty.

The field of learning theories has also experienced advances. Findings from neuroscience have promoted a new understanding of what really happens in the brain when we learn. At the same time, the fact that learning increasingly takes place in virtual communities led George Siemens (2004) to propose connectivism as a learning theory for the digital age. Similarly, Roberto Carneiro (2010) suggested a theory he called generativism which aims at describing collaborative learning with digital technologies and open educational resources. These theories might be better able to describe and explain lifelong learning than classical learning theories. In the field of digital technologies, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have recently received a great deal of attention.

A total of 29 problem situations were designed and included within five stories related to the daily life of any adolescent. A total of 102 adolescents and young people were interviewed and asked how they would react to these problem situations. The responses were subjected to a content analysis in order to select the most frequent responses indicative of different levels of competence development. Ten experts then assigned the problem situations to one of the eight competences proposed by Arnau et al.

However, there are difficulties in mastering the foreign language. As before, the main ones are: the lack of active oral practice, the absence of the environment for foreign language communication, and the presentation of educational material in textbooks without taking into account the principle of individualization and differentiation of education. The solution to this problem is possible through applying the ideas of developmental teaching at the lesson. The purpose of this study is to substantiate theoretically and test experimentally the effectiveness of using the ideas of developmental learning at the foreign language lessons to develop students' communicative competence. The leading method of the research is a pedagogical experiment aimed at revealing the level of the development of students' communicative competence. The content analysis of foreign language textbooks was also used to identify potential options to apply ideas of developmental learning. Results of the research: The article presents a selection of topical projects aimed at students' partially exploring and research activities that form the communicative competence directly; there were developed lessons to introduce the ideas of the developmental teaching at the lesson. It is proved that the projects assembled in the textbook contribute to building interdisciplinary connections, stimulate the development of the communicative competence and, on the whole, favour the development of the student's personality. Relevance of the study: The study proved the effectiveness of using the ideas of the developmental teaching to develop students' communicative competence.

Results show that although preschools have relatively low access to computers and teachers have relatively low ICT competencies, they declare similar ICT related obstacles and impacts compared to their colleagues in secondary schools. Also, results show that preschool students seem to use computers in the classroom more frequently than their peers in primary and secondary schools and that the activities they implement are focused on developing key curriculum related areas implementing tasks that can be associated to the exercising of key competencies and skills. This specialised use of computers in preschools, which is much more focused than the activities with computers reported by teachers in higher levels, could be explained by the relative low variety of educational software available in these preschools, the availability of the computers in the classroom rather than in labs: the special type of teaching and learning activities implemented at this age level and/or due to the relative lack of teachers' ICT competencies. On the one hand, these results highlight the need for further research, and on the other, it constitutes an interesting lesson for policy designer that tend to advocate for considering computers as multipurpose technologies that should be used across subjects, levels and teaching strategies. In this case, computers seem to play a very specific and concrete role in preschools classrooms that, eventually, contributes to improve students' outcomes, which highlights the potential of considering the use of computers, software and other technologies to improve specific subject areas at particular levels while designing ICT in education policies for this age group.

Design/methodology/approach - The pedagogical model is based on the principles of education for sustainable development and focuses on the establishment of a repeatable platform for dialogue between students and mentors, members of the mentoring team, the local community, external members of the consulting team of experts and foreign master's degree programmes, in the process of producing students' projects. The proposed method addresses several dimensions, including: the education of students, teachers, professionals and local experts, the establishment of a network for cooperation and collaboration and the delivery of practical and usable results. Findings - The paper provides a comparative overview of the pedagogical model's application in producing the final master's degree projects of three generations of students, as well as its alignment with the needs of re-defining the role and reach of the profession of urban planner in an environment of post-socialist transition. The model was improved, enhanced and optimised through this process and then corroborated with its practical implementation.

The analysis is based on a review of the recent literature on the NOS, and especially on the results of a previous Delphi study in which 31 experts were asked to propose key aspects of scientific competence for citizenship. The present study involved three stages: identification of NOS themes in the experts' initial proposals, analysis of how their importance ratings of these themes changed over the course of the Delphi rounds, and analysis of variability among the experts according to their professional group. We identified 12 NOS themes that, in line with recent publications in this field, included those related to the practice of science.

As in other countries, a medical residency is not obligatory to practice as a doctor. In this context, this paper aims to clarify what and when competencies in communication and professionalism should be addressed, shedding light on the role of university, residency and post-residency programmes. Methods: Brazilian family physicians with diverse levels of medical training answered a questionnaire designed to seek a consensus on the competencies that should be taught (key competencies) and when students should achieve them during their medical training. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and correlation tests. Results: A total of seventy-four physicians participated; nearly all participants suggested that the students should achieve communication and professionalism competencies during undergraduate study (twenty out of thirty competencies - 66.7%) or during residency (seven out of thirty competencies - 23.33%). When competencies were analysed in domains, the results were that clinical communication skills and professionalism competencies should be achieved during undergraduate medical education, and interpersonal communication and leadership skills should be reached during postgraduate study.

Lately, a new model of teachers' diagnostic competence and therewith a new measurement method focusing on diagnosing students' learning behavior in an interdisciplinary approach have been developed. They can build a basis for promoting teachers' diagnostic competence. However, some questions relevant to promoting teachers' diagnostic competence concerning students' learning behavior still remain unanswered: Which values do teachers-on-the-job in contrast to preservice teachers with or without teaching experience gain through experience and which are the relevant variables that lead to a high level of diagnostic competence focused on learning behavior? Thus, this study aims at enlightening these issues. In a sample of 293 participants (93 German grammar school teachers, 107 German teacher students in their second phase of teacher education, and 93 German preservice students in their first phase of teacher education), teachers' diagnostic competence concerning learning behavior as well as teachers' motivation, attitude, self-efficacy, knowledge, and reflection on experience concerning diagnosing was measured. Motivation, attitude, and knowledge were found to be substantial positive predictors of diagnostic competence concerning learning behavior, with differentiated predictions for teachers' experience. Reflection on experience and self-efficacy unexpectedly was not found to be relevant. Teachers-on-the-job were generally better at diagnosing their students' learning behavior than were preservice teachers without teaching experience.

University sustainability programs intend to provide integrated education that fosters the key competencies students need to solve real-world sustainability problems. Translating sustainability competencies into effective pedagogical practice in integrated academic programs is not straightforward. This work builds on a previous study by both expanding the competencies evaluated and considering additional demographic characteristics. Design/methodology/approach - The paper summarizes previously identified key sustainability competencies and describes teaching methodologies used to foster these competencies in students. Development of competencies in students during a semester-long course is assessed using a pre-/post-test based on two case studies. The implications of the findings for teaching practice and overall program structure are discussed. Findings - Based on the assessment methods used here, four of the five sustainability competencies evaluated in this study developed differently in students according to gender, disciplinary affiliation and age. Females improved interpersonal competence more than males. Systems thinking competence improved for students associated with the three disciplinary affiliations considered in this study: sustainability major, sustainability minor and business major. Anticipatory competence improved for sustainability and business majors only, but not for students minoring in sustainability and majoring in other disciplines. Finally, normative competence improved for younger students only. Research limitations/implications - Insights for teaching practice and overall program structure are based on assessment of one introductory transdisciplinary sustainability course. Much additional work is needed to draw strong conclusions about general teaching practices and program structure for sustainability education. This study provides a flexible and field-tested rubric for further evaluative work in other sustainability courses or degree programs. Practical implications - Universities incorporate sustainability into their undergraduate curricula in many ways, ranging from certificates to entire degree programs focused on sustainability. The results of this study suggest that educators pay attention to gender diversity, classroom teaching practices, disciplinary perspectives and student attitudes and developmental stages as they figure outhow to make sustainability part of undergraduate education. This information may help create more effective sustainability courses and academic programs, which may maintain the viability of current sustainability programs and promote the institutionalization of sustainability in higher education. Originality/value - This research contributes to undergraduate sustainability education by providing insight into how sustainability education might thoughtfully be integrated into academic programs. It also offers an assessment approach for use by other sustainability educators to evaluate effectiveness of teaching practice and overall program structure based on five key sustainability competencies commonly cited in the literature.",,,,,,,,,,,156,20,20,,,,,,,,,,,,2015,16.0,4,,,,,537,575,,10.1108/IJSHE-01-2013-0005,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000357391700010

There is a lack of knowledge, how non-experts like medical students solve clinical problems. It is known that they have difficulties applying conceptual knowledge to clinical cases, that they lack metacognitive awareness and that higher level cognitive actions correlate with diagnostic accuracy. However, the role of conceptual, strategic, conditional, and metacognitive knowledge for clinical reasoning is unknown. Methods: Medical students (n = 21) were exposed to three different clinical cases and instructed to use the think-aloud method. The recorded sessions were transcribed and coded with regards to the four different categories of diagnostic knowledge (see above). The transcripts were coded using the frequencies and time-coding of the categories of knowledge. The relationship between the coded data and accuracy of diagnosis was investigated with inferential statistical methods. Results: The use of metacognitive knowledge is correlated with application of conceptual, but not with conditional and strategic knowledge. Furthermore, conceptual and strategic knowledge application is associated with longer time on task. However, in contrast to cognitive action levels the use of different categories of diagnostic knowledge was not associated with better diagnostic accuracy. Conclusions: The longer case work and the more intense application of conceptual knowledge in individuals with high metacognitive activity may hint towards reduced premature closure as one of the major cognitive causes of errors in medicine. Additionally, for correct case solution the cognitive actions seem to be more important than the diagnostic knowledge categories.",,,,,,,,,,,27,11,14,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 24,2016,16.0,,,,,,,,303,10.1186/s12909-016-0821-z,,,,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines",,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000389276400003

It presents a capacity building framework that can be accommodated in various levels of design curriculum development. The framework allows for a macro-view on the key clusters of competencies for ecodesign while allowing for alignment with quantitative and qualitative approaches to evaluation and assessment The proposed framework does not intend to be universally prescriptive, and it should provide a context for the development bespoke educational programmes and activities. Design/methodology/approach - The research utilises a variety of data sources and methods to provide answers to the research questions. Empirical data were collected through the course of a two-year programme of capacity building with design educators in Wales. This two-year programme incorporated a series of workshops and scoping discussions with teaching staff. Additional data were collected through a literature review and best practice scanning. Thus, the research did not follow a linear process. Instead, it was performed according to an iterative process, evolved by interaction between a theoretical foundation (capacity building, ecodesign education) and empirical material (workshops, literature review). Findings - Design education may need to situate itself away from the traditional art or engineering setting to facilitate greater interdisciplinary learning. This repositioning of design education will allow for multidisciplinary relationships with other schools and communities such as social science, business or planning. There will be a role for the promotion of international design institutes that provide a more concentrated experience of the value of design and design education. Research limitations/implications - This paper sought to explore the context of capacity for sustainable development as it relates to design education. It briefly highlighted some gaps in the literature on capacity building for ecodesign education along with proposing a conceptual framework of key competencies. The intention is to initiate a discussion on the means by which these can be integrated into mainstream design education, lifelong learning and entrepreneurship training. Originality/value - There is no similar framework presented in the literature.

Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Uganda between June and September 2016 to assess the teaching methods and teacher training needs for secondary school agriculture curriculum. Data were collected from 80 agriculture teachers and 57 administrators from 60 secondary schools, randomly drawn from 25 districts in Uganda. The data were analysed with descriptive statistics. Findings: The findings show that there about 10 key competences required by the teachers to thrive in their profession. These range from traditional classroom teaching to community outreach and linkages with agribusinesses which is in tandem with outcomebased education beyond the classroom walls. Respondents highlight lack of practical agriculture skills and exposure to the modern farming practices. Theoretical implications: This paper examines role of formal inservice teacher training based on theory of change and proposes using professional learning communities for school-level improvements.

A functional construct implies that specific acts of writing and their purposes constrain what is a relevant selection among the semiotic resources that writing generally affords. In this article, we present the specific criteria that are currently being introduced in Norwegian teaching and assessment of writing, as well as selected aspects of their development. The article builds on an assumption that assessment criteria have such educational importance that even their origins, intellectual trajectories and underpinnings should be given attention in educational research. In this context, the article presents elements of a rare approach, in that national 'norms of expected proficiency' at politically predefined educational grade levels have been grounded in sustained collaboration with experienced teachers of writing across the curriculum, and may thus be viewed as yet unofficial 'standards'. In the first step, a combination of existing curricula and literature review of writer development was used to tentatively draft a first set of criteria for the grades included in a 2005 national test of writing (grades 4, 7, 10 and 11). In the second step, such criteria were developed through an iterative, long-term process where initial criteria were confronted with the judgements of experienced teachers. Through 'think aloud' assessment interviews, pairs of teachers across Norway were asked to assess specific cases of students' writings and voice criteria for their judgements, both within and across a series of domains. In the third step, interview transcripts were used to search for criteria used by several pairs of locally situated teachers across geographically distributed schools. Criteria thus identified were pooled into a refined set of 'national standards' that were subsequently tested out in everyday classroom contexts. On the basis of this confrontation with educational reality, the set has been further refined to form the version presented in this article. The Norwegian case raises a range of issues related to curriculum development, 'standards' and educational sustainability.",,,,,,,,,,,25,10,10,,,,,,,,,,,,2016,27.0,2,,,,,229,245,,10.1080/09585176.2015.1134338,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000381708500005

The goal of this qualitative study is to focus on John Dewey's concept for reflective inquiry as well as on the interpretations of his ideas by other authors. The intention is to merge these interpretations into a whole for two reasons: 1) to reconstruct John Dewey's model for reflective inquiry, to adapt this model to the peculiarities of Science education practice. To realize this goal, a comparison should be drawn between the meanings of key concepts from Deweys texts and those in the texts of his followers and reviewers. As a result of this interpretive framework, the authors of this paper abandon the general understanding that the stages of reflective thinking comprise a main component in Dewey's concept for reflective inquiry. The emphasis moves to the connection between reflection and the actions in the course of inquiry. On the basis of reconstructing Dewey's model, the authors suggest ideas for actualizing and activating students 'reflection before, during and after completing different types of experiments.",,,,,,,,,,,33,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,2015,63.0,,,,,,29,39,,,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000453752400004

While the manager's role is one of the seven key competencies, there is still no formal management course in most postgraduate curricula. Based on a needs assessment we conducted, several themes were identified as important for a possible management training program. We present the results of the pilot training we performed to investigate two of these themes. Methods: The topics knowledge of the healthcare system and time management were developed from the list of suggested management training themes. Fourteen residents participated in the training and twenty-four residents served as control. The training consisted of two sessions of four hours with a homework assignment in between. 50 True/false-questions were given as pre- and post-test to both the test and control groups to assess the level of acquired knowledge among the test group as well as the impact of the intervention. We also performed a qualitative evaluation using evaluation forms and in-depth interviews. Results: All fourteen residents completed the training. Six residents in the control group were lost to follow up. The pre-and post-test showed improvement among the participating residents in comparison to the residents from the control group, but this improvement was not significant. The qualitative assessment showed that all residents evaluated the training positively and experienced it as a useful addition to their training in becoming a medical specialist. Conclusion: Our training was evaluated positively and considered to be valuable. This study supports the need for mandatory medical management training as part of the postgraduate medical curriculum.

To equip students with inter-and transdisciplinary competencies is highly demanding for educators. Educators must not only know how to teach students such competencies, but need to be experienced in inter-and transdisciplinary research and must have some technical knowledge about inter-and transdisciplinarity. This paper aims to show how university educators can be supported in their teaching. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is a case study based on research and on experiences in interdisciplinary teaching and in supporting educators in their interdisciplinary teaching. Findings - The paper presents a competence framework of interdisciplinary competencies to guide university teachers that has been developed, implemented and refined in interdisciplinary study programmes belonging to the field of ESD. It shows how the professional development of educators could be addressed referring to the experiences in these programmes. The measures presented consist for one thing of interdisciplinary processes among the educators and of measures directly supporting educators in their teaching for another thing. Originality/value - The case study the paper refers to is of special value, first, because the experiences are based on long-standing research and on two decades of experiences. Second, because considerable efforts were made to deliver coherent and consistent interdisciplinary teaching in which interdisciplinarity was not only a teaching subject for the students but showed by the educators as well so that the educators involved did not only talk about competencies for inter-and transdisciplinary collaborations but also set an example in their own doings.",,,,,,,,,,,34,14,15,,,,,,,,,,,,2017,18.0,5,,,,,630,647,,10.1108/IJSHE-02-2016-0030,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000405476500001

Despite the multiple studies that address this issue, it is necessary to continue improving research in this area, deepening the assessment of teachers' digital competencies and design, on this basis, more practical and personalized training programs that respond to the needs of teachers in the digital era.",,,,,,,,,,,57,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 10,2022,19.0,1,,,,,,,8,10.1186/s41239-021-00312-8,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000753373600001

Accepting that something needs to be measurable to be systematically improved, the authors explored how measures relate to potential targets. This paper aims to focus on dispositions to think critically (active open-minded thinking and fair-minded thinking in appraising reasoning) as measures and explored how they related to sustainability concern as an indicative educational target. Design/methodology/approach This research included the development and testing of research instruments (scales) that explored dispositions to critical thinking and sustainability concern. Authors researched these instruments within their own correspondence groups and tested them with university students and staff in Pakistan, the USA, Austria, India and New Zealand. The authors also asked a range of contextualising questions. Findings Respondents' disposition to aspects of active, open-minded thinking and fair-minded thinking do predict their concern about facets of sustainability but their strength of religious belief was an important factor in these relationships and in their measurement. Practical implications This research demonstrates the complexity of monitoring dispositions to think critically and sustainability concern in educational systems, particularly in circumstances where the roles of religious beliefs are of interest; and suggests ways to address this complexity. Originality/value This research integrates and expands discourses on ESD and on critical thinking in diverse disciplines and cultures.

The proposal in this paper is to show how students learn and develop competences by performing practical activities and through a collaborative experience, conducted in a real-life context in the university campus. Design/methodology/approach - This paper collects together a selection of competences and sub-competences in SSR, together with the methodological scenarios that allowed their implementation. The results in the acquisition of competences, as well as the efficiency of the methodological strategies employed, were obtained from the qualitative analysis of student questionnaires and of their final academic results. Findings - Changing the teaching methods to include collaborative methodological strategies facilitates the acquisition of SSR competences. Research limitations/implications - A methodological limitation of this study is the fact that it has taken place in one academic year. The authors realize that to provide evidence of a profound behavioural change (which goes beyond the improvement of a habit), there is a need to carry out a longer study, which is complex when working with final year students. The authors are suggesting that the University carry out prolonged studies on the implementation and assessment of competences in SSR in the University and afterwards in the work place. Practical implications - At the start of the course year, a problem was identified, namely, that future teachers lacked sustainable habit patterns. This was turned into a learning opportunity that led to a collaborative SSR programme on the campus. Social implications - Creating varied practical methodological scenarios has contributed to the development of SSR competences by the pupils. Students have questioned their lifestyles and have modified their consumption habits. Additionally, doing a transdisciplinary collaborative programme in our own campus has played a part in changing our organization for the better and has facilitated combining research and teaching.

The regional focus meets a gap in the literature. An online survey of employers in North Queensland found that they attach importance to a wide range of skills and competencies and see sustainability as a key factor in future business success. Yet, there are contradictions in terms of their support for sustainability in the curriculum and business practices, particularly when it comes to the recruitment and selection process. Furthermore, contradictions exist between the university's adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the weak interest displayed by prospective employers in graduates' sustainability literacy. This study has important implications for regional universities. A reframing of the role of sustainability education in the curriculum is warranted, where a deeper connection is made between sustainability education and the values employers already hold.

This is particularly relevant for coordinated market economies with firm-driven but collectively governed apprenticeship systems. Recent literature has identified different liberalization trajectories for these countries. For instance, segmentalism describes the increasing influence of large employers in Germany. In Denmark, state agencies manage increased flexibility in training through embedded flexibilization. In this paper, we identify a new form of embedded flexibilization, characterized by polite employer domination. We find this trajectory of liberalization in Switzerland, which represents another training system heavily based on firm involvement. We illustrate our argument with the example of short-track apprenticeship training, which has been expanded in all three mentioned countries in response to ongoing liberalization and deindustrialization pressures. In Switzerland, the relevant reform was initiated by the state while business adopted a rather passive role initially. Yet, state actors eventually stepped back and delegated key competences to employers, which implies that the employers' camp asserted their interests in the end while tolerating some concessions for the benefit of disadvantaged groups.

In order to aptly monitor interactions with distant learners, it is proposed that three types of regulation pertaining to socio-affective, pedagogical and multimedia aspects are required. On the one hand, this research aims at specifying these competencies and, on the other hand, it seeks to identify the relevance of reflective analysis for professional development. The context of this study is a teacher training programme for Masters Degree students in teaching French as a foreign language that provides trainees with the opportunity of teaching online to intermediate-level students of French from a North American university via a desktop videoconferencing platform. This programme first endeavours to put trainees in a professional situation by getting them to prepare and administer sessions in order to confront them with the specific challenges of synchronous online tutoring. Second, it seeks to help them to gain insight into their own activity by developing critical thinking towards their own practice. The data elicited for this research derive from the tutor trainees' interpretations of their own practice when confronted with the film of their own situated activity. The episodes chosen by the trainees to feed the self-confrontation process constitute significant units because by being told and commented upon, they elucidate how and to what extent competencies are built. Three discursive strategies have been identified and used to organise the content analysis of the data: description; expression of a difficulty; reflective review of the activity. The strategies used by trainees to verbalise their own activity can inform teacher educators about the constraints of the work situation and about the resources trainees need to deploy to face Lip to this unknown professional situation. Results indicate that trainees concentrate particularly on pedagogical aspects that distance and faulty technology have rendered complex. The encountered difficulties are equally distributed between a repertoire of competencies pertaining to language teaching and competencies more directly linked with online teaching. Finally, this study has enabled us to assess the potential of self-confrontation for teacher practice and leads us to propose directions for improving this training device.",,,,,,,,,,,42,57,59,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2009,21.0,,2,,,,166,185,,10.1017/S0958344009000214,,,,Education & Educational Research; Linguistics; Language & Linguistics,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000269987700004

To overcome this gap and to complement formal education by more informal learning settings, we developed, implemented and evaluated a web-based and socially-interactive learning platform. The platform hosts several learning games and aims at enhancing secondary school students' orthography and arithmetic skills. In a pilot evaluation (Study 1), we observed the orthography games to specifically corroborate 5th and 6th graders spelling performance. On the other hand, we only found general intervention effects with respect to arithmetic. To supplement these results by the perspective of those who may wish to use the platform for educational purposes, we also conducted a survey among teachers (Study 2). The survey provided an informative basis on the estimated difficulty and relevance of learning topics in orthography and arithmetic as well as on the use and acceptance of computer-supported teaching methods in general.

Asking questions is an important component of rich learning experiences, structurally embedded in the operations of critical thinking. Our clear sense is that critical thinking and, within that, critical questioning, is heavily context dependent, in the sense that is applied, used by critical learners in a contextualised way. Purpose: Our research deals with enhancing science undergraduates' critical questioning. We are interested in understanding and describing the nature and development of students' critical questioning. The purpose is to conceptualise critical questioning as a competency, into three domains - knowledge, skills and attitudes/dispositions. We have no interest in a taxonomic category of context-free question-types called 'critical questions'. In contrast, our view is that 'being a critical questioner' trades heavily on context. Sources of evidence: Four cases are considered as illuminative of the dimensions of science undergraduates' critical questioning. Data were collected in natural learning environments through non-participant observation, audio-taping teacher-students interactions and semi-structured interviews. Students' written material resulting from diverse learning tasks was also collected. Main argument: Our supposition is that one vehicle for achieving university students as critical thinkers is to enable them not just to ask critical questions, but to be critical questioners. We relate critical questioning to three domains: (1) context, (2) competency and (3) delivery, and propose a model based on illuminating examples of the in-classroom action. Conclusions: The dimensions of the competency-context-delivery model provide a framework for describing successful student critical questioning, showing that students' capacity to be critical can be developed. It is possible, in our view, to generate critical questioners by means of promoting a true spirit of critical inquiry. The model also gives important insights into the design of teaching, learning and assessment contexts, where critical questioning could be promoted.",,,,,,,,,,,37,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2014,32.0,2,,,,,115,134,,10.1080/02635143.2014.902811,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000337566300003

Moreover, the variety of involved stakeholders (planners, tenants, housing companies, private landlords, energy consultants, etc.) represents conflicting aims for solving this problem. This paper aims to present a systematic linkage between higher education for sustainable development (HESD) and education about energy poverty yet. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative comparative case study approach with a similar didactic approach is used. Findings Based on the literature about HESD and an overall model in general didactics, ten criteria were identified and used for an overall reflection about similar courses dealing with the topic of energy poverty. The criteria covered the learning goals, the didactical approaches and the institutional support in the forms of organisation in the courses. Research limitations/implications There was no competency measurement of the students in the described courses. Practical implications There was no evaluation of the development of students' key competencies for sustainability. However, the reflections of students and teachers revealed a positive development regarding the students' learning process, especially because they worked on a real-world sustainability problem: energy poverty.

J,"Frank, P",,,,"Frank, Pascal",,,A proposal of personal competencies for sustainable consumption,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,,,,Article,,,,,,Sustainable consumption; Education for sustainable consumption; Competency-based education; Personal competencies,POST-TRUTH; HIGHER-EDUCATION; KEY COMPETENCES; BEHAVIOR; CLIMATE; FRAMEWORK; VALUES; POLARIZATION; EFFICACY; IMPACT,"Purpose Despite advances in Environmental and Sustainability Education (ESE) scholarship and practice, ESE has not yet contributed to mitigate the sustainability-related problems it is meant to remedy. As part of an explanation, some scholars have argued that current ESE scholarship and practice overemphasizes intellectual and neglects (intra-)personal competencies as envisaged learning outcomes of ESE learning programs and activities. To date, however, such personal competencies have not been systematically specified in terms of the challenges they are meant to respond to. This paper aims to derive personal competencies from an analysis of inner challenges individuals face when engaging with the cause of sustainable consumption. Design/methodology/approach The study is conceptual and proceeds in two steps: In the first step, it analyzes existing research on challenges individuals experience when intending to change their consumer behavior and engaging in consumption-related learning activities. In a second step, a set of personal competencies for sustainable consumption are derived from the analysis of challenges. Based on the set of competencies, suggestions for future research empirically corroborating the reflections of this paper are made. Findings The discussion of challenges indicates that both sustainable consumption and consumption-related learning activities can come along with a series of affective-motivational challenges. In contrast to established competency frameworks, personal competencies emphasize the importance of affective-motivational learning outcomes instead of intellectual ones. They are defined here as abilities, proficiencies or skills related to inner states and processes that can be considered necessary to engage with the cause of sustainability. Personal competencies responding to the inner challenges of engaging with sustainable consumption include ethics, self-awareness, emotional resilience, self-care, access to and cultivation of ethical qualities and mindsets for sustainability. Research limitations/implications Given that this paper is conceptual, further research is needed to empirically inquire into the importance of personal competencies for sustainable consumption and corroborate the provided reflections. Furthermore, the study has not responded to some of the concerns a few ESE experts have expressed concerning the concept of (intra-)personal competencies more generally. To address these concerns, future research should be dedicated to empirically validating and operationalizing personal competencies, eventually leading to tools allowing for a systematic assessment of these competencies. Based on such assessment tools, pedagogical formats should be elaborated and evaluated with regard to their potential to stimulate personal sustainability competencies. Originality/value The concept of personal competencies explicitly acknowledges that current unsustainability is associated with the experience of inner, affective-motivational challenges. ESE learning programs and activities should prepare learners for these challenges. However, a specification of these inner challenges and corresponding personal competencies has not yet been undertaken.

Individual tasks of project assignment titled Temperature Measurement were conceived for guided inquiry. We also supported the IBL of pupils by interactive education strategy-Integrated e-Learning (INTe-L). The strategy was built on the role of interactive simulations and experimenting at the knowledge acquisition. The following INTe-L components were used: (a) on-site and remote experiments, (b) interactive simulations and (c) electronic study materials. The research was based the hypothesis that the project-based teaching of the topic Temperature Measurement using the IBL activities is significantly more efficient than traditional (instructivist) way of teaching. To verify the hypothesis, we carried out a pedagogical experiment on a sample of 60 respondents. The third graders were divided into two parallel groups: an experimental group (EG, 30 pupils) and control group (CG, 30 pupils). To get a relevant feedback, pre-test and post-test were developed and applied. The results attained in the EG were statistically processed, evaluated, and subsequently compared with those in the CG. The analysis of the results attained by the EG showed that their knowledge acquisition has been increased by 24% compared to CG. We have created a methodology for making simple scientific project assignments with the implementation of all components of the new integrated e-learning education strategy (real and real remote experiment, e-simulation, e-learning material). On a specific example of the topic Temperature Measurement in primary education, we have presented the possibility of using a guided inquiry in the implementation of individual experimental tasks. We have introduced a form of teamwork that allows to harmonize the teaching requirements with individual learning approach and helps to prepare pupils for planned work and independent knowledge acquisition and problem solving. The study has shown that complex IBL activities can be successfully applied at primary school 3rd grade level already. Our form of education with the wider use of modern information and communication technologies (ICT) was attractive for the learners and helped them to develop interdisciplinary relationships. The integrated e-learning has helped third grades to develop a deeper conceptual understanding of temperature and allowed them to prepare presentations to demonstrate their conceptual knowledge. The approach allowed pupils to gain key competencies in Science (discussion and presentation of results). It has also increased the pupils' interest in Science in general and helped them to understand links between different subjects.",,,,,,,,,,,74,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2021,11.0,9,,,,,,,506,10.3390/educsci11090506,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000699592700001

Coaching, broadly accepted as a training modality in medical education, has been proven a successful tool for teaching communication skills. Little research is available thus far to investigate virtual coaching on communication skills for telemedicine encounters. The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that virtually coaching residents on communication skills is feasible and acceptable. We surveyed 21 resident-faculty pairs participating in a fully virtual coaching session (patient, coach, and resident were virtual). Methods We asked 50 neurology resident-faculty coach pairs to complete one fully virtual coaching session between May 20 and August 31, 2020. After each session, the resident and coach completed a 15-item survey, including Likert-style scale and open-ended questions, assessing feasibility and acceptability. Descriptive statistics and qualitative content and thematic analyses were performed. Results Forty-two percent (21/50) of all eligible residents completed fully virtual coaching sessions. The overall survey response rate was 91 % (38/42). The majority of respondents agreed that the direct observation and debriefing conversation were easy to schedule and occurred without technical difficulties and that debriefing elements (self-reflection, feedback, takeaways) were useful for residents. Ninety-five percent of respondents rated the coach's virtual presence to be not at all disruptive to the resident-patient interaction. Virtual coaching alleviated resident stress associated with observation and was perceived as an opportunity for immediate feedback and a unique approach for resident education that will persist into the future. Conclusions In this pilot study, residents and faculty coaches found virtual coaching on communication skills feasible and acceptable for telemedicine encounters. Many elements of our intervention may be adoptable by other residency programs. For example, residents may share their communication goals with clinic faculty supervisors and then invite them to directly observe virtual encounters what could facilitate targeted feedback related to the resident's goals. Moreover, virtual coaching on communication skills in both the in-person and telemedicine settings may particularly benefit residents in challenging encounters such as those with cognitively impaired patients or with surrogate decision-makers.",,,,,,,,,,,44,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 29,2021,21.0,1,,,,,,,513,10.1186/s12909-021-02936-w,,,,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines",,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000701045700001

As policy texts are 'heteroglossic in character' (Lingard and Ozga, in The Routledge Falmer reader in education policy and politics, Routledge, London and New York, 2007, p. 2) and create circumstances in which the range of options available in deciding what to do are narrowed or changed (Ball in, Education policy and social class: The selected works of Stephen J Ball, Routledge, London and New York, 2006, p. 46), they need to be theoretically tackled in their underlying assumptions and implications. This proposal draws on an analysis of two sets of documents of the European Union: texts produced between 2000 and 2006, underlying the European Union programmes; and texts produced by a working group focusing on the key competences of Lifelong Learning (2003-2006). Initially, the framework for the analysis of different documents was grounded on the existing research in the field of educational policy. Now we attempt a secondary analysis of the collected data by transposing the borders of this particular and highly prolific field. We argue that what is outside the texts may reshape what is inside the texts. Educational theory allows us to define some conceptual tools in order to question the documents as political apparatus which open and constrain possibilities. Therefore, we will use educational theory as an arena where different matters, perspectives and possibilities may be explored and assembled. We have engaged in a conversation with both the data and some theoretical approaches. Central to this conversation are the concepts of ignorant schoolmaster (Ranciere, in The ignorant schoolmaster five lessons in intellectual emancipation, Stanford University Press, Stanford, 1991), learning contexts (Edwards, in Rethinking contexts for learning and teaching, Routledge, Oxon and New York, 2009a, b), and experience (Larrosa, in Revista Brasileira de Educacao, 19:20-28, 2002).",,,,,,,,,,,27,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2012,31.0,3,,,SI,,275,288,,10.1007/s11217-012-9294-7,,,,Education & Educational Research; Philosophy,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000305246300007

The methodology enables us to quantify this perception, which, in turn, allows us to determine: to what extent the objectives related to ESD are achieved in the degree, and to compare the learning in ESD perceived by students of different degrees. The methodology is applied to nine engineering degrees and nine education degrees in the Spanish university system. Design/methodology/approach ESD is analysed from the students' learning perception. This perception is measured by comparing the responses of first- and fourth-year students to a questionnaire about their sustainability competencies. Two indicators have been designed to analyse the results. The first indicator, learning increase, measures the declared learning difference between fourth- and first-year students. The second indicator, learning percentage, measure the amount of learning as reported by fourth-year students compared to how much they could have learned. Findings The results show that the average learning percentage perceived by students is higher in engineering degrees (33%) than in education degrees (27%), despite the fact that the average learning increase declared by students at the end of their studies in both areas of knowledge is similar (66%). Engineering students report having achieved higher learning than education students in all sustainability competencies, with the exception of ethics. Originality/value This paper analyses ESD from the student's perspective. Furthermore, to the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study that compares the perception of ESD between engineering and education students. This comparison allows us to determine the different approaches that university Professors take to ESD according to the discipline they teach.",,,,,,,,,,,48,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,APR 26,2022,23.0,4,,,,,940,959,,10.1108/IJSHE-02-2021-0060,,OCT 2021,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000705654800001

It is found that the methodology of lapbooking allows you to unlock the potential of each student in the process of creating individual or more often collective work. In particular, the lapbook forms key skills and abilities, which are required by the educational vector of the New Ukrainian School. In addition, it takes into account cross-curricular learning and social competencies, which help each individual to become successful and adapt in society. The article proves that the use of Lapbooks is reasonable not only when studying a single topic, but also as a complex, systemic type of work, as close to the project and research activities as possible. It was found out that the introduction of lapbooking at different stages of studying subjects is effective, as it covers different types of activity: pair and group work; search methods and work with information (ability to work with sources, generalize and systematize, draw conclusions, formulate own statements concisely and informatively). It is noted that the technique of lapbooking can be applied as early as preschool age with a gradual complication of high school. Consequently, the general essence of lapbooking is systematized with the help of integrative diagrams and charts. It is determined that the educational industry must be flexible to timely respond to changes in society and provide the professional market with specialists, successful and active citizens who are able not only to adapt, but also to realize themselves. The innovativeness of the lapbooking method is that it combines different areas of activity simultaneously: informational, research, design, communicative, creative, technological, aesthetic. The results of the study allow us to recommend lapbooking as the main method of work in elementary school (when studying any topic or academic subject).",,,,,,,,,,,17,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,14.0,33,,,,,,,16698,10.20952/revtee.v14i33.16698,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000722554700001

While the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) demand organisations to change practices and adapt to sustainable goals, there is a lack of understanding in how competencies can enhance these goals. The purpose of this paper is twofold: Study 1 explores competencies related to sustainability required in a work force and examines employer perceptions on the existing literature for competencies. Study 2 empirically tests the influence of sustainability scholarship on non-technical competencies in the work force. Design/methodology/approach - A mixed method approach was undertaken. A sample of managers from 39 large Australian organisations participated in the scoping study. This was followed by further interviewing executives from 12 multinational corporations in China to assess the validity of competencies and provide deeper understanding of the issues at hand. The quantitative study analysed a sample of executive responses from 229 multinationals in China using factor and regression analysis to test for the effects of mediation. Findings - The research highlights that the underlying competencies regarding sustainability influences the bigger picture within firms for attaining sustainability. The affective and cognitive growth of sustainability scholarship is governed mainly by a firm's sustainable values. Core organisational values facilitate the development of non-technical competencies. These relationships and their cumulative effect on competencies provide a theoretical framework for acquiring sustainability within organisations. Employees need sustainability scholarship for enhancing sustainability. Sustainability scholarship reflects high-level learning obtained through universities or training. The research found that non-technical competencies such as professional ethical responsibility mediate between core business competencies and sustainability scholarship. Originality/value - By exploring employer's perception of competencies, the study first makes an important contribution in addressing the need to support SDGs by bridging organisational-level competencies and sustainability literacy, which hold significant benefits for practitioners, academia and organisations at large. Second, the theoretical findings strengthen the need for embedding competencies in the curriculum. It conveys the need for sustainability literacy/scholarship to align with organisational training and learning pedagogies, in order to effectively meet industry needs. Third, it provides useful insights on employers' estimation about workplace competencies and broadens our understanding on the contribution that competencies within organisations make to this end.",,,,,,,,,,,61,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,61.0,3,,,,,310,325,,10.1108/ET-08-2018-0184,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000489720700002

This is not only the consequence of the importance of some pathogenic microorganisms, but also due to their positive and important role in processes related to human health, food production or waste recycling, to cite a few. However, the relevance of microbiology for the well-being of humankind and the planet still needs to reach beyond academic circles. Many current matters of urgency, such as environmental pollution or climate change, could partly be tackled by using green and sustainable solutions derived from microbial biotechnologies. Nevertheless, the wider public still attributes a negative connotation to microbes such as fungi and bacteria. The aim of this study was to implement service-learning as a pedagogical approach to increase scientific and microbiology literacy in society. Service-learning is a teaching and learning strategy that integrates community service and civic responsibility, fostering the dissemination of scientific knowledge. This approach is used to communicate about pressing societal issues surrounding microbes (antibiotic resistance, natural resources recycling, human microbiota, and food production among others) to an audience of pupils attending public schools. The activity of service-learning is proposed in the final year of the biology bachelor curriculum. Its purpose is to allow university students to develop and practice their lay communication skills as a key competence to be acquired during their university education. In the activity, the students developed their own concept and material for the activity and delivered it to pupils at primary and secondary school levels (pupils aged 6-15 years old). The message is also expected to be disseminated beyond the participants, when the students and pupils share their experience with family and friends. With this pedagogical approach, we intend to raise awareness regarding about the importance of microbiology and its dual roles as harmful and beneficial for humans. We also wish to increase the connection between primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions.

The aims of the administered questionnaire were to identify students' perceptions of the development of sustainability competencies; to analyse the relationship between students' perceived level of competence and the subject area, previous teaching experience and previous participation in sustainability projects; and to explore the strengths and limitations of the assessment tool used. Design/methodology/approach - An ad hoc questionnaire of 18 items was designed to analyse students' self-conception of the development of four sustainability competencies. A set of six units of competence were identified and three levels of acquisition for each unit Knowledge (referred to conceptual learning), Knowhow (related to practical skills) and Do (linked to the demonstration in action and its transferability to real-life situations). The sample included 183 postgraduate secondary teacher students from different disciplines and subject areas. Findings - The findings of this study show that students positioned themselves for the four sustainability competencies in a medium level of competence. No statistical significant differences exist between the subject areas and the level of sustainability competence.

Background In a highly active learning environment that incorporates research into teaching, the effective use of various learning strategies is considered of high importance for the successful engagement of students. Yet, this line of research has mainly focused on individual learning. Shifting from individual to collaborative learning settings, the current study investigated whether students' use of self-regulated learning, peer learning, and help seeking strategies influenced their perceptions on both the group activities and the respective outcomes. Methodology At the beginning of the course, 81 first semester postgraduate students self-reported the level of use of self-regulated learning, peer learning, and help seeking strategies by filling in the respective subscales of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). Then, groups of 3 or 4 students were formed and instructed to create several learning artifacts of different types and conduct a peer-tutoring session, based on a topic assigned to them by the teacher. Additionally, the same groups conducted a research project of their own choice within course topics. Students' final grade served as an indicator of their academic performance. At the end of the semester, students filled in a questionnaire eliciting their perceptions on the process and the outputs of the course activities. Finally, through statistical analysis of students' responses to the questionnaires, the influence of learning strategies on students' perceptions and their academic performance was examined. Contribution Our findings contribute to the literature regarding the research-teaching nexus in higher education settings. More specifically, the study shows how students' self-reported use of learning strategies affects students' perceptions on the activities they were engaged in, their achievement of cognitive learning outcomes, and their skills development in a research-integrated course design. Findings Students perceived differently the value of producing and studying learning artifacts. Students who scored higher in the self-regulated learning and peer learning subscales of MSLQ perceived their role as more active in the preparation of the presentation for the peer-tutoring session, which was the artifact that required higher level of interaction among the group members. Students' final grades were influenced partially by their self-reported use of different learning strategies. Recommendations for Practitioners Integrating research into teaching through the assignment of research-related tasks to students can promote students' acquisition of domain knowledge and research skills. The merits of this approach can be further strengthened by having students working in groups and providing the outputs of their involvement in the research-related activities as learning material for their peers. Furthermore, students' individual characteristics (e.g., use of learning strategies and preferences should be taken into account when designing course activities). Recommendations for Researchers Researchers should continue to explore the way that various learning strategies influence different aspects of the learning process, especially in the achievement of cognitive learning outcomes and the development of general skills. Impact on Society Creating learning environments that foster students' active engagement with the course material and peer collaboration should be a vital goal of higher education institutes as it can improve students' performance and promote the necessary skills for self-directed and autonomous learning, a key competence in the modern workplace. Future Research In this study, both cognitive learning outcomes and general skills were assessed by students' final grade. In a future study, distinguishing these different types of learning outcomes would allow us to examine in more detail the impact of students' learning strategies and course activities on the accomplishment of cognitive learning outcomes and general skills.",,,,,,,,,,,60,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,,2018,17.0,,,,,,345,363,,10.28945/4120,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000447125200001

Part 1 of the written exam comprises multiple choice questions (MCQ) covering basic and clinical science, while Part 2 has 18 short answer questions (SAQ) examining diagnosis and management. Candidates must pass both written components to progress to the clinical exam. Validity was evaluated using Kane's framework for scoring (marking criteria, item analysis), generalization (blueprint), extrapolation (standard setting), and implications (outcome, including pass rates). A competency-based blueprint, the Optometry Australia Entry-level Competency Standards for Optometry 2014, guided question selection with the number of items weighted towards key competencies.

Background The global shift to competency-based medical education aims to improve the performance of its trainees, including in the key competency domain of clinical reasoning. However, research on whether such education actually improves clinical reasoning is sparse. The purpose of this study is to compare assessed clinical reasoning performance in digitally presented cases of acute dyspnoea between final-year medical students from a traditional, discipline-based and those from an integrated, competency-based undergraduate programme. Methods A total of 60 medical students in their final-year clerkships participated in the study; 30 were from a discipline-based programme, and 30 were from a competency-based programme of the same faculty. The students completed a knowledge test consisting of 22 single choice items and a computer-based test of clinical reasoning with six video-based case scenarios with different underlying diseases leading to dyspnoea. The operationalized measures of clinical reasoning were the number and relevance of the diagnostic tests chosen, time to diagnosis and diagnostic accuracy. Results The two groups did not differ in their knowledge of the acute dyspnoea content domain. With regard to clinical reasoning, the selection of relevant tests, time required to make a diagnosis and accuracy of the diagnosis varied across the six case scenarios in both groups. However, the results from the measures of the clinical reasoning process did not differ between the students from the two types of undergraduate medical programmes. No significant differences were found with regard to the selection of relevant diagnostic tests (M = 63.8% vs. M = 62.8%), the time to a diagnosis (M = 128.7 s vs. M = 136.4 s) or the accuracy of diagnosis (M = 82.2% vs. M = 77.0%). Conclusions Key indicators of the clinical reasoning process, when assessed with objectively measured parameters, did not differ between final-year medical students from a traditional, discipline-based and those from an integrated, competency-based undergraduate programme in the domain of acute dyspnoea.

This instrument consists of 9 batteries with 83 items presented in the form of the five-point Likert scale. The questionnaire evaluated different aspects of respondents' attitudes towards the concept of sustainable development, but students' attitudes in relation to the items from the following subscales will be presented for this paper: understanding the concept of sustainable development, position of sustainable development in the system of higher education, sources of information about sustainable development and entities responsible for sustainable development. The study sample consisted of students from the University of Novi Sad, specifically from the faculties with accredited programs in the field of humanities and technological sciences. Findings In general, students recognized the main determinants of sustainable development and they support an integral approach to sustainability, i.e. the need to include the knowledge, values and skills for sustainable development in the higher education programs. In addition, they identified a number of obstacles and the uncertainties of overcoming them. In this regard, the students did not recognize the responsibility of the higher education institutions as the key responsibility or their own responsibility in relation to sustainable development, which can be related to their feeling of marginalization and the doubt that their behaviour and decisions can influence the development of the local society, as well as the development of the society as a whole. On the other hand, the respondents acknowledged the role, the importance and the responsibility of the mass media in the process of developing the attitudes towards and opinions about the problems related to environmental protection and sustainable development. Practical implications The results of the study indicate the students' attitudes towards sustainable development, thus making the directions for higher education reform clearer and in line with the present needs for sustainable development in Serbia. The obtained results can serve as a recommendation to the governing structures, i.e. to the relevant ministries of education and environmental protection, as well as to the universities in terms of which direction their process of planning and creating paths of sustainability should take. This is particularly important in the case of the Republic of Serbia, which is currently in the process of joining the European Union and responding to the requirements set by the process of negotiation for Chapter 27 in terms of improving the strategic framework and plans for the education for sustainable development and building the capacities in response to climate change. On the other hand, linking the results of this research with the results of similar studies around the world contributes to the further enrichment of the scientific knowledge base in this field and confirms the need for stronger and united efforts on the path to a sustainable future. It is a fact that, regardless of the national, economic, socio-political and cultural context, there is a global lack of success in shaping a humane and sustainable relationship between man and nature. Therefore, the results of this research should be considered as an invitation for new research initiatives regarding the ways to support the positive attitudes of students towards the concept of sustainable development and to facilitate their further development in the educational process, as well as in other academic domains. Originality/value This research is inspired by the fact that, in the Balkan countries, education for sustainable development has not been extensively discussed within the scientific discourse on higher education for sustainable development. This is one of the first papers to provide data about students' attitudes towards the concept of sustainable development and the need for its implementation in the higher education system in Serbia. The value of the paper lies in its potential to help understand the role that different drivers and barriers play in higher education for sustainable development.",,,,,,,,,,,43,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,21.0,4,,,,,733,755,,10.1108/IJSHE-11-2019-0336,,MAY 2020,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000531843500001

In previous research, a theoretical framework describing the underlying aspects of competence-based education was developed. In this study, three aspects of this framework were used to analyse connectivity between learning in school and learning in the workplace. These aspects were: i) authenticity, ii) selfresponsibility, and iii) the role of the teacher as expert and coach. Three stakeholder groups (i.e., students, teachers, and workplace training supervisors) involved in secondary VET programs in the field of life sciences in the Netherlands were questioned on these aspects. Based on their interviews, it is concluded that these aspects provide information about the process of connectivity. Because stakeholder groups hold different conceptions of workplace learning and often do not communicate adequately about mutual responsibilities, the implementation of these aspects of competence-based education has not significantly improved the connectivity situation. Nevertheless, these aspects of competence-based education can guide stakeholder groups in making clearer agreements about mutual responsibilities, which may improve connectivity in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,42,47,47,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2010,3.0,1,,,,,19,38,,10.1007/s12186-009-9027-4,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000282987900002

More recently, in 2013 the Tuning Latin America Project introduced the challenge to reach agreement on the education of psychologists in the region. The purpose of this research is to analyse the degree of importance and perceived achievement of the specific competences set out in the Tuning Latin America Project, among a sample of 100 advanced psychology students of a private university in the City of Buenos Aires. For such purpose, the Specific Competences Survey for students of the Tuning Latin America Project was used. All the competences obtained high ratings in terms of importance, in particular those related to professional ethics.

Design: This research is a comparative analysis of two groups. The first group consists of undergraduate and graduate students majoring in agriculture who are members and non-members of student cooperatives (n = 256). The second group consists of agricultural faculty members (n = 59). Findings: The results of this study show that students and teachers have different views with regard to the extent to which CBE principles are practiced in the College of Agriculture. Moreover, students with different learning patterns had different perceptions regarding the extent to which CBE is practiced, whereas teachers with different teaching patterns had the same perception of the application of CBE principles in the College of Agriculture. Practical implications: This study has practical implications for agricultural higher education in general and colleges of agriculture in particular. Colleges of agriculture across Iran could encourage their students to establish and engage in student cooperatives so that the 'what' and 'how' aspects of CBE are put into practice. Theoretical implications: This study has theoretical implications for CBE principles. For example, student cooperatives can be utilized by faculty members as one of the main strategies for developing CBE in agricultural colleges.

The purpose of this study is therefore to identify and explore the improvement directions of curriculum through core competence diagnosis. To achieve this, preliminary and follow-up surveys were conducted using offline questionnaires with students in the Department of Library and Information Science. According to the results of the analysis of this core competence diagnosis, the weakest competence was glocal competence, which was found to be statistically significant (t=9.095, p<.000). Among the four sub-factors of glocal competence, the ability to use foreign languages was the least developed (t=-25.286, p<.0001). There is a need to promote a variety of experiences and organize a program that develops confidence in students to converse with foreigners or to write what they wish in a foreign language.

In medical education in Argentina, in the context of international discussions around competence-based education (CBE), competence frameworks are being developed for undergraduate and postgraduate education, constituting agreed criteria that lead to the design of training programs and work as key tools to ensure educational quality. The Tuning Project and other international frameworks account for this process towards a common definition of standards beyond geographic and disciplinary boundaries. Generic competences (GCs) have acquired increased relevance in CBE discussions, whereas in medical education they involve key skills for patient safety - yet clarity in their implementation still has to be accomplished. In competence-based medical education (CBME), some changes are being hindered by the absence of a common language as well as diverging ideologies and theories. The purpose of this work was to explore conceptions and the terms used when referring to GCs by people in charge of educational planning and design of Human Resources (HR) training policies in Argentina. A qualitative exploratory study was conducted based on semi-structured interviews to key informants from different levels and fields in medical education. Interviews were conducted by one interviewer and analysed by two independent researchers. Results showed that medical educational planners have different conceptions regarding GCs and fail to share a common language to enunciate them. They acknowledge their relevance for patient safety and agree with the notion that, at this time of educational transformation, it would be useful to enunciate them separately from specific competences, although they realise that this involves potential risks in curricular design.

The study is an empirical contribution to the debate about outcome- and competency-based approaches in health sciences education. A qualitative method was used to study how teachers from 14 different study programmes designed courses before and after OBE was implemented. Using an interpretative approach, analysis of documents and interviews was carried out. The findings show that teachers enacted OBE either to design for more competency-oriented teaching-learning, or to further detail knowledge and thus move towards reductionism. Teachers mainly understood the outcome-based framework as useful to support students' learning, although the demand for accountability created tension and became a bureaucratic hindrance to design for development of professional competence. The paper shows variations of how teachers enacted the same outcome-based framework for instructional design. These differences can add a richer understanding of how outcome- or competency-based approaches relate to teaching-learning at a course level.",,,,,,,,,,,33,11,12,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2014,19.0,5,,,,,629,643,,10.1007/s10459-013-9491-3,,,,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Health Care Sciences & Services",,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000344625300002

Respondents were asked to gauge lecturers' practices of employing different methods and strategies to promote multiple intelligences and holistic learning styles and to indicate what their preferences were concerning methods that could be employed more often. Results show that lecturers promote holistic learning, despite prominence of practices that are more tied to logical and analytical skills, in the left hemisphere, with less emphasis on right hemisphere processes such as ludic activities, drama and simulations, and physical involvement.

It is argued that, although Smithers is broadly correct in his attack on the NCVQ, there are some areas of ambiguity and also ways in which the critique fails to capture the full scope of the problems. The nature and full implications of the inappropriateness of the NCVQ enterprise is illustrated through an examination of the main weaknesses of National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) and the competence-based education and training (CBET) strategy which underpins them and, in particular, by reviewing some specific problems of learning and assessment and the findings of a number of recent critical studies. In view of the seriousness of these shortcomings of the NCVQ system it is suggested that perhaps the only genuine solution to the current difficulties lies in the recommendations of the 1993 National Commission on Education report for the abolition of the present system of academic and vocational qualifications.",,,,,,,,,,,60,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,1994,20.0,2,,,,,251,265,,10.1080/0305569940200208,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:A1994PB90700008

The relationships between these variables were analysed in a sample of 894 first-year Dutch university students, using linear structural modelling. Results show that learning process factors play other roles in explaining perceived competence than in explaining earned credits. Perceived competence and earned credits, as two sides of the same coin in competence-based education, are only weakly related. Furthermore, this study shows that it is most likely that perceived competence affects earned credits, but a model in which earned credits affects perceived competence as possible causal relationship was also accepted, although the relationship remains weak. The practical implication of this study is that, as long as perceived competence and the number of credits are not related, competence-based higher education will not obtain optimal efficiency.

The competences that students should acquire during their studies include transversal competences, which are those competences related to leadership skills, problem solving, and teamwork, highly valued by labor market. This is particularly important in engineering, as these skills can influence the selection of one candidate over another. So, the evaluation and teaching of these kinds of competences are now some of the main challenges facing university professors as the corresponding learning objectives need to be set and assessed, both for study programs as well as for each individual subject, and this process is new for teachers. Focusing precisely on this aspect, our work, based on an empirical study conducted with a sample of 102 engineering students from the University Center of Merida, uses a tool to measure the progress of such students in different transversal competences.

Competence models undoubtedly pose some important, constructive challenges to traditional arrangements for developing knowledge and expertise at all occupational levels. However, CBET's impact goes far beyond this. Its processes profoundly affect how teachers and learners view learning, assessment and the purposes of education itself. CBET is also symptomatic of wider changes in notions about ownership, pluralism and breadth in post-compulsory education and training. It therefore poses a profound and forceful ideological challenge to particular educational values, and to the way teachers approach their professional role. This article uses post-16 teacher education as a focus for exploring some of these wider effects. It reviews recent critiques of CBET and argues that many are preoccupied with attempting to improve its efficiency at the expense of examining the wider political and ideological context in which it is being implemented. In order to counter the drift towards a narrow utilitarian curriculum in all sectors of the post-compulsory system, analyses of CBET will need to show its powerful effect on some important democratic traditions in learning and education.

Despite the growing interest in this competence, there are several issues requiring deep reflection, such as: What is global competence? How has it been constructed? From which approaches are the discursive processes for its construction based? And, what does intercultural education contribute to this construct? To answer these questions, this paper analyses the background, conceptualisations, approaches and theories on which the concept has been built, with special emphasis on interculturality as an educational approach and model that favours inclusion. The method used is a critical review and discursive analysis. It has been found that the instrumentalist approach to social efficiency has predominated in the conceptualisation, (at least as the underlying approach), as opposed to an approach of social re-constructionism that usually appears in the foreground. On many occasions the global competence and intercultural competence constructs are used interchangeably, although the former is more comprehensive in addressing the challenges of globalisation. Finally, it is highlighted that there are conceptual and measurement challenges and limitations that make it difficult to compare the acquisition of this competence at an international level and that therefore require more studies that systematically investigate the construction of the concept, its development and measurement.",,,,,,,,,,,53,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN-JUN,2022,34.0,1,,,,,83,103,,10.14201/teri.25394,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000702728500003

The curriculum has subsequently been developed, using backward design. Thereafter, the curriculum has been submitted for accreditation to test the successfulness of the approach. Findings A generic job profile and a competence framework such as the e-CF support the development of standardised education. The generic PVIB job profile used works well. The e-CF can be useful, but requires modifications and the introduction of sub-competences. However, the main complaint concerning the e-CF is the use of examples instead of mandatory content.

Methods: In this qualitative study students from three different health education programmes were observed while discussing clinical cases in a modified Harvard case method session. A rubric with four dimensions - problem-solving process, disciplinary knowledge, character of discussion and communication was used as an observational tool to identify clinical reasoning. A deductive content analysis was performed. Results: The results revealed the students' transition over time from reasoning based strictly on theoretical knowledge to reasoning ability characterized by clinical considerations and experiences. Students who were approaching the end of their education immediately identified the most important problem and then focused on this in their discussion. Practice knowledge increased over time, which was seen as progression in the use of professional language, concepts, terms and the use of prior clinical experience. The character of the discussion evolved from theoretical considerations early in the education to clinical reasoning in later years. Communication within the groups was supportive and conducted with a professional tone.

Yet, according to Whitehead, the ultimate goal of education should be to teach students to learn to apply knowledge. Furthermore, one is confronted with the problem that discipline-specific knowledge and skills are insufficient to respond adequately in a situation with discipline-transcending, new and unknown problems. Next to discipline-specific knowledge and skills, more general knowledge and skills are needed in the area of e.g., communication, problem-solving, use of information, analysis, decision-making. General knowledge and skills, however, offer no guarantee whatsoever that somebody also has sufficient discipline-specific expertise at his disposal. These am die problems that Nijenrode University wants to solve with a new curriculum for management education. In the curriculum developed by Nijenrode, students learn to apply heuristics in the area of general skills and meta-skills (reflecting and learning-to-learn) in interaction with a varying discipline-specific learning content. In this context, discipline-specific knowledge and skills on the one hand, and general skills and meta-skills on the other hand are, in relation to each other, both the objective as well as the means. The student learns the one thing with the help of the other and vice versa, by means of a continuing process of contextualization and decontextualization.

This study examined what information program directors use and how they value this information in making a judgment of residents' performance and what residents think of this process.MethodsSixteen semi-structured interviews were held with residents and program directors from different hospitals in the Netherlands in 2015-2016. Participants were recruited from internal medicine, surgery and radiology. Transcripts were analysed using grounded theory methodology. Concepts and themes were identified by iterative constant comparison.ResultsWhen approaching semi-annual meetings with residents, program directors report primarily gathering information from the following: assessment tools, faculty members and from their own experience with residents. They put more value on faculty's comments during meetings and in the corridors than on feedback provided in the assessment tools. They are influenced by their own beliefs about learning and education in valuing feedback. Residents are aware that faculty members discuss their performance in meetings, but they believe the assessment tools provide the most important proof to demonstrate their clinical competency.ConclusionsResidents think that feedback in the assessment tools is the most important proof to demonstrate their performance, whereas program directors scarcely use this feedback to form a judgment about residents' performance. They rely heavily on remarks of faculty in meetings instead. Therefore, residents' performance may be better judged in group meetings that are organised to enhance optimal information sharing and decision making about residents' performance.",,,,,,,,,,,52,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 8,2019,19.0,,,,,,,,13,10.1186/s12909-018-1446-1,,,,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines",,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000455210600001

Residents constitute an important workforce at many hospitals. Yet, the effect of training on residents' contribution to production in patient care is scarcely studied. This study evaluated the effects of early competency-based procedural training on residents' contribution to patient care in central venous catheterization and spinal and epidural anesthesia. Methods: The design was a non-randomized cohort study of first-year anesthesiology residents. The intervention group received additional early focused skills training while three control groups received traditional competency-based education. The residents' contributions to patient care were compared between the intervention group (n = 20), a historical control group (n = 19), and between a contemporary control group (n = 7) and a historical control group (n = 7) from different departments. The residents' vs specialists' procedural production share was compared between years within each study group. We calculated specialist time saved compared to the time spent providing additional skills training in the intervention group. Results: We found statistically significant increases in residents' vs specialists' share of total production after the intervention for epidural anesthesia: 2015: 0.51 (0.23, 0.70) to 2017: 0.94 (0.78, 1.05), p = 0.011 and central venous catheterization: 2015: 0.30 (0.23, 0.36) to 2016: 0.46 (0.35, 0.55), p = .008; and to 2017: 0.64 (0.50, 0.79), p = 0.008. Comparison between residents and specialists on production of the three procedures before and after the intervention showed a surplus of 21 h of freed specialist time per year.

This study analyzes the influence of receiving feedback by teaching associates in the context of achieving and maintaining a level of expertise in complex head and skull examination. Methods: All third year students at a German university who completed the obligatory surgical skills lab training and surgical clerkship participated in this study. The students were randomized into two groups. Control group: lessons by an instructor and peer-based practical skills training. Intervention group: training by teaching associates who are examined as simulation patients and provided direct feedback on student performance. Their competency in short-and long-term competence (directly after intervention and at 4 months after the training) of head and skull examination was measured. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics version 19 (IBM, Armonk, USA). Parametric and non-parametric test methods were applied. As a measurement of correlation, Pearson correlations and correlations via Kendall's-Tau-b were calculated and Cohen's d effect size was calculated. Results: A total of 181 students were included (90 intervention, 91 control). Out of those 181 students 81 agreed to be videotaped (32 in the control group and 49 in the TA group) and examined at time point 1. At both time points, the intervention group performed the examination significantly better (time point 1, p = <.001; time point 2 (rater 1 p = .009, rater 2 p = .015), than the control group. The effect size (Cohens d) was up to 1.422. Conclusions: The use of teaching associates for teaching complex practical skills is effective for short-and long-term retention. We anticipate the method could be easily translated to nearly every patient-based clinical skill, particularly with regards to a competence-based education of future doctors.",,,,,,,,,,,41,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 28,2017,17.0,,,,,,,,65,10.1186/s12909-017-0892-5,,,,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines",,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000397663600001

The magnitude of the impact of the pandemic on surgical training among ophthalmology residents is not known. This study aims to quantify changes in average case logs among United States (U.S.) ophthalmology residency graduates prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of aggregate, national data on case logs of U.S. ophthalmology residency graduates from 2012 to 2020. The yearly percent change in the average number of procedures performed in the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) ophthalmology resident case logs were analyzed using linear regression on log-transformed dependent variables. The average percent change from 2019 to 2020 was compared to the average yearly percent change from 2012 to 2019 for procedures performed as the primary surgeon, and primary surgeon and surgical assistant (S + A), as well as procedures for which there are ACGME minimum graduating numbers. Results Across all procedures and roles, average case logs in 2020 were lower than the averages in 2019. While average total cases logged as primary surgeon increased yearly by 3.2% (95% CI: 2.7, 3.8%, p < 0.001) from 2012 to 2019, total primary surgeon case logs decreased by 11.2% from 2019 to 2020. Cataract (-22.0%) and keratorefractive (-21.1%) surgery experienced the greatest percent decrease in average primary surgeon cases logged from 2019 to 2020. Average total cases logged as S + A experienced an average yearly increase by 1.2% (95% CI: 0.9,1.6%, p < 0.001) prior to 2020, but decreased by 9.6% from 2019 to 2020. For ACGME minimum requirements, similar changes were observed. Specifically, the average case logs in YAG, SLT, filtering (glaucoma), and intravitreal injections had been increasing significantly prior to 2020 (p < 0.05 for all) but decreased in 2020. Conclusions These findings demonstrate the vulnerability of ophthalmology residency programs to a significant interruption in surgical volume. There is a critical need for development of competency-based, rather than volume-based, requirements to evaluate readiness for independent practice.",,,,,,,,,,,16,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 4,2022,22.0,1,,,,,,,142,10.1186/s12909-022-03205-0,,,,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines",,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000764704100004

An assessment of the implementation status in Flanders from teachers' and students' points of view,TEACHING AND TEACHER EDUCATION,,,,Article,,,,,,Competence(s); Teacher training; Perceptions; Innovations; Imposed change; Elementary; School teacher education; Competency-based teacher education (CBTE); Pre-service teacher training; Educational change,LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS; PORTFOLIOS,"Since 1998, the Flanders' educational government in Belgium has been urging teacher education institutions by decree to implement competences in teacher training programs. Since then, years have gone by, and institutions have acted in order to achieve the competence-based goals. However, have they succeeded in implementing them? This is the research question that is central to the current study. An online survey inquiry was set up in eight elementary teacher education institutions using two questionnaires; one for final year elementary institution pre-service teachers, who were about to graduate at the time of completing the questionnaire (N = 218), the other for teacher trainers throughout the elementary teacher training program (N = 51). Ten years after the decree was issued, results show that competence-based education has become a reality in terms of its implementation. However, the process has not yet come to an end. Whereas some competences are clearly present in the institutions' policies and practices (e.g. teacher as guide to learning and development, teacher as subject expert), others are poorly represented (e.g. teacher as partner of parents, external parties and as a member of the educational community). Moreover, teacher trainers tend to take four different approaches to the implementation of competences (1) during internship, (2) through the institution's policy and program planning, (3) by means of their integration in both theoretical and practical components of the curriculum and finally, (4) a lack of implementation because the competences are considered insufficiently applicable by the teacher trainers. In particular, more experienced and subject expert teacher trainers tend to adopt the final approach more often than do younger colleagues and pedagogues. Student teachers' results, on the other hand, suggest important differences between institutions concerning their understanding of competences and the integration of these competences in the curriculum; suggesting different paces of adaptation between teacher education institutions. Moreover, even within schools, the trajectory towards implementation is not always clear for all members of the teaching team, nor for the students of most teacher education institutions. Consequently, there is still important work to be done in order for successful competence-based change to occur. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A quantitative study of forms, perceptions of impact and related individual and organisational factors",EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING,,,,Article,,,,,,Vocational education and training; Teacher collaboration; Collegiality; Teacher professional development and learning; Teacher survey,,"Background This study investigates teacher collaboration in Hungarian vocational education and training (VET) schools based on an online survey of teachers (n = 303). Collaboration of teachers has long been appreciated for its significant benefits including increased motivation, job satisfaction, self- and collective efficacy, as well as its role in teacher professional development and school improvement. Collaboration of teachers working in VET schools, especially in VET systems where initial VET is provided to young people and (in part) within compulsory education, appears as particularly desirable, given the special context, objectives and challenges of this sector and the spread of competence-based education. However, relatively little is known about VET teacher collaboration, especially in Hungary, where three different profiles of teachers-general subject and vocational teachers and vocational trainers-work in VET schools. The aim of our study was to provide data about how Hungarian VET teachers collaborate, which could validate prior research results on teacher collaboration as well as identify any special features of the VET context. Method Our study design was exploratory, descriptive and correlational, applying quantitative statistical analysis. We measured teacher collaboration (practice and perception of impact) and explanatory individual and organisational factors selected for our research framework by adapting instruments of previous empirical studies (most importantly, OECD's TALIS). We analysed connections between collaboration and independent variables created by principal component analysis. Results Our data show that sharing-type collaboration (professional discussions and exchange of materials) are widespread among Hungarian VET teachers. They are much less likely to participate in deeper collaborative activities that presuppose higher levels of interdependence, and they also appreciate the impact of deeper collaboration less. Female respondents participate in sharing-type activities more than their male colleagues, and middle-aged (40-55) are most active in both types of collaboration and perceive the most impact. Collaboration practices correlate most with perceptions of their impact. More frequent collaboration and perceptions of higher impact are related to teachers' sense of higher self-efficacy and relaxed, tolerant and encouraging collegial relationships. Structural barriers seem to influence only sharing and perceptions of impact. Small, but statistically significant differences in collaboration were found between the three teacher profiles. Vocational trainers (who instruct vocational school practice) showed the highest level of participation in deeper collaboration, while vocational teachers were least likely to participate and perceived the least impact. No significant associations were found between collaboration and prior or current work experience in the taught vocation. Conclusions Our results largely confirm and validate previous research on teacher collaboration in lower level and general educational contexts by providing data on VET teacher collaboration. They also note the role of some VET-specific factors, such as structural barriers and small, but statistically significant differences between different VET teacher profiles.",,,,,,,,,,,40,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 13,2021,13.0,1,,,,,,,2,10.1186/s40461-020-00108-6,,,,Education & Educational Research,,,,,,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000607545800001
