COVID-19 related remote schooling revealed that the level of digital competence for learning is not at an expected level. While schools try to overcome this issue, there is a need to understand the level of students' digital competence by assessing it. However, previous attempts to design a comprehensive digital competence test have not been entirely successful. One of the reasons might be that the focus of these tests has been too general. Therefore, the aim of this study was to create a test for assessing primary and lower secondary school students' digital competence for learning in ten dimensions identified based on earlier studies. This digital competence for learning assessment test (Digitest) was carried out with 836 third to ninth grade students from Estonian schools. IRT analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were conducted to establish the potential of the test to measure digital competence for learning and discover which latent variables can be differentiated with it. The results showed that nine dimensions describing attitudes, skills and behaviours can be distinguished with the Digitest and that the test items have good fit to assess digital competence for learning. However, the study also revealed that two higher-order dimensions of digital competence for learning could be identified: motivational and cognitive-behavioural. Thus, empirical data collected with the Digitest is initiating discussions for assessing students’ digital competence in a holistic way but also more general discussions on the concept of competence. This can help educators put greater emphasis on areas where students need further improvement. © 2023 The Authors",Distance education and online learning; Elementary education; Evaluation methodologies; Information literacy; Secondary education,E-learning; Factor analysis; Confirmatory factor analysis; Distance education and online learning; Elementary education; Evaluation methodologies; Information literacy; Learning assessment; Online learning; School students; Secondary education; Secondary schools; Students,Haridus- ja Teadusministeerium,"Adov, L., Predicting teachers' and students' reported mobile device use in STEM education: The role of behavioural intention and attitudes (2022), https://dspace.ut.ee/handle/10062/76359, Thesis; Aesaert, K., van Nijlen, D., Vanderlinde, R., van Braak, J., Direct measures of digital information processing and communication skills in primary education: Using item response theory for the development and validation of an ICT competence scale (2014) Computers & Education, 76, pp. 168-181; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behaviour: Reactions and reflections (2011) Psychology and Health, 26 (9), pp. 1113-1127; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behaviour (2012) Higgins, handbook of theories of social psychology, 1, pp. 438-459. , P.

Also, it aimed to ascertain teachers’ self-efficacy and satisfaction toward the implementation of a competence-based curriculum (CBC). The study utilized a quantitative approach. During the 2018–2019 school year, 180 female middle-school Islamic studies teachers completed a questionnaire that aimed to identify their perspectives regarding various dimensions of transition (planning, classroom implementation, and assessment) created by a CBC implementation. A Kruskal–Wallis’ test was implemented to examine potential differences in self-efficacy among participant responses to the planning, classroom implementation, and assessment dimensions related to age and experience variables. Results showed that participants had higher levels of competence in planning and classroom implementation than assessment when implementing the CBC. The novelty of the CBC and inadequate training were the main impediments regarding its implementation. Participants showed no difference in average scores by either age or experience regarding their sense of self-efficacy in implementing the CBC. The study concluded that teachers are the main cause of failure or success when applying innovative curriculum practices. Islamic studies teachers showed flexibility in embracing the new curriculum and indicated that the application of the CBC was considered a new transition within their educational practices. At the same time, experienced teachers were skeptical of the transition because of their familiarity with the objective curriculum, which they implemented for years, and the insufficient preparations and training before and during the CBC application. © 2022, The Author(s).",Competence-based curriculum; Islamic education; Objective-based curriculum; Self-efficacy,,,"Ahmad, M., (2016) A proposed training program based on teaching competencies necessary for raising the educational performance of technical schools’ teachers in Khartoum state.

But is there really a deficit in competencies that schools must address? This review of empirical studies in anthropology and cultural psychology documents that people learn and practice many key competencies in everyday life. However, the situation affects practice, and school-like assessments are situations ill-suited to eliciting everyday competencies. The inaccurate deficit model and questionable assessments paint a misleading picture of how to solve underemployment in the knowledge economy. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",21st century competencies; anthropology; cultural psychology; deficit model; OECD PISA; social and emotional learning,,,"Adair, J.K., Phillips, L., Ritchie, J., Sachdeva, S., Civic Action and Play: Examples from Maori, Aboriginal Australian and Latino Communities (2016) Early Child Development and Care, 187 (5-6), pp. 798-811; Amanti, C., (2013), International Influence and the Mexican Education System.

This study designed a dual scaffold-oriented strategy planning board game based on cognitive scaffolding and peer scaffolding and combined it with a real-time checking mechanism using mobile technology. The 68 university students were divided into an experimental group for scaffold game-based learning and a control group for case-based discussion learning to investigate the differences in learning effectiveness, flow and learning anxiety, and to explore the technology acceptance, scaffold usefulness, and activity anxiety of the game-based learning group. The results revealed that the learning effectiveness of the experimental group was significantly improved, while there was no significant difference in the control group; the overall flow and technology acceptance of the experimental group were both relatively high; learning anxiety was significantly reduced in both groups, and the experimental group did not have excessive activity anxiety. There were no significant differences in learning anxiety of the two groups. As for scaffolding usefulness evaluation, the proportion of using peer scaffolding was the highest, and the learners thought that using peer scaffolding was helpful for developing their strategic planning skills. It is suggested that the design of the game mechanism in the future can encourage learners to use the cognitive scaffolding and the mobile-based metacognitive scaffolding more often, and the quality of peer discussions may be improved through the real-time evaluation of the metacognitive scaffolding. © 2023, De La Salle University.",Anxiety; Board game; Mobile technology; Scaffolding; Strategic planning,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","Arnab, S., Lim, T., Carvalho, M.B., Bellotti, F., de Freitas, S., Louchart, S., Suttie, N., De Gloria, A., Mapping learning and game mechanics for serious games analysis (2015) British Jounal of Educational Technology, 46 (2), pp. 391-411; Bourgonjon, J., Valcke, M., Soetaert, R., Schellens, T., Students’ perceptions about the use of video games in the classroom (2010) Computers & Education, 54 (4), pp. 1145-1156; Bawa, P., Watson, S.L., Watson, W., Motivation is a game: Massively multiplayer online games as agents of motivation in higher education (2018) Computers Education, 123, pp. 174-194; Briz-Ponce, L., Pereira, A., Carvalho, L., Juanes-Méndez, J.A., García-Peñalvo, F.J., Learning with mobile technologies—students’ behavior (2016) Computers & Education, 72, pp. 612-620; Chan, H.Y., Liu, S.W., Hou, H.T., November 28 – December 1) An Analysis of the Acceptance and Anxiety of a Historical Strategic Planning Game by Combining Real Person Non-player Character Mechanism.

With this relationship in view, English language proficiency constitutes a ‘rational’ educational pathway for national and personal-level success within an outwardly meritocratic knowledge economy. Yet, in Japan, as in many other locales, English has been accused of strengthening pre-existing power relations. Accordingly, this inquiry draws on Bernstein’s pedagogic device, to address the nested fields of production, recontextualisation, and reproduction shaping educational practice. Regarding production, normative OECD discourses framing essential key competencies favour an epistemic hierarchy privileging the orthodoxy of free-market capitalism. Through unequal pedagogic reform, meanwhile, the recontextualisation of regulatory discourse limits valued forms of knowledge to learners attending prestigious mass-market institutions. This, in turn, holds implications for reproduction. Through recognition and realisation, the classification and framing of English as a ‘valid’ knowledge privilege students from middle-class households. The appropriation of English as a ‘rational’ contact point for global communication, business, and finance thereby risks obfuscating the socio-economic order determining its practice. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Bernstein; globalisation; Higher education policy; Japan; neoliberalism,,,"Aarseth, H., (2022), The implicit epistemology of metric governance.

Despite the growing interest in this competence, there are several issues requiring deep reflection, such as: What is global competence? How has it been constructed? From which approaches are the discursive processes for its construction based? And, what does intercultural education contribute to this construct? To answer these questions, this paper analyses the background, conceptualisations, approaches and theories on which the concept has been built, with special emphasis on interculturality as an educational approach and model that favours inclusion. The method used is a critical review and discursive analysis. It has been found that the instrumentalist approach to social efficiency has predominated in the conceptualisation, (at least as the underlying approach), as opposed to an approach of social re-constructionism that usually appears in the foreground. On many occasions the global competence and intercultural competence constructs are used interchangeably, although the former is more comprehensive in addressing the challenges of globalisation. Finally, it is highlighted that there are conceptual and measurement challenges and limitations that make it difficult to compare the acquisition of this competence at an international level and that therefore require more studies that systematically investigate the construction of the concept, its development and measurement. © 2022 Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca.

To address this research gap, this study adopted a key-competence-based subject knowledge learning tool, i.e. Smart Learning Partner (SLP), and conducted a quasi-experimental study to evaluate its effects among middle school students. A total of 400 participants in Grade 7 from four schools were followed for a period of two and a half years. The results on online learning engagement indicated that the manipulation generally succeeded in promoting students’ use of SLP in the experimental schools. Furthermore, the results on academic performance showed that SLP could not only directly benefit students’ learning in the first academic year but also continued to have an effect within the following one and a half years. This study contributes to the existing knowledge in two aspects: first, it extends the use of an adaptive learning cognitive map and shows positive effects in supporting the implementation of the whole curriculum; second, it presents a long-term and large-scale example of successfully integrating ICTs into the key-competence-based curriculum reform in the Chinese context. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",direct and sustained effects; Key-competence-based curriculum; learning tool; middle school; subject knowledge,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Ministry of Education-China Mobile Research Fund Project,"Albatayneh, N.A., Ghauth, K.I., Chua, F.F., Utilizing learners’ negative ratings in semantic content-based recommender system for e-learning forum (2018) Educational Technology & Society, 21 (1), pp. 112-125; Amigues, R., Agostinelli, S., Collaborative problem-solving with a computer: How can an interactive learning environment be designed?

Amid the currently advancing (technological, social, techno-social) trends, prominent attention is drawn to skills and competences, which are universal for all spheres of activity - soft skills, key competences. They are known as universal competences in Russian higher education. The aim of the article is to pinpoint universal competences (UCs) and to analyze their specific features in the context of competence-based education. Materials and methods. The authors use methods of etymological, conceptual and comparative analysis combined with dialectical and diachronic approaches and discursive reflection. The study was based on competence-based education-related documents and projects of EU, OECD, UNESCO, the World Bank as well as on monographs and articles of top experts and research groups. Results. During the study, the term of universal competences was differentiated from the associated terms (soft skills, key competencies, generic competencies, and 21st century skills); the role of universal competences was identified as a balancer in higher education for equilibrating its two missions: Preparing students for successful career and helping them become well-rounded personalities. It has been found that the terminological confusion and the lack of consensus on many aspects of competence-based education have an ambivalent character. The idea of universal competences was identified as a Russian version of a tool (and the outcome) of the integration of two opposite intentions of the national educational policy: Blending in the mainstream of the competence-based approach and retaining its uniqueness. A contribution was made to expanding the conception of universalism as the foundation for competence-based education, including the one in Russia. Conclusion. We acknowledge that the concept of universal competences can make competence-based education more balanced in Russian environment or, on the contrary, it can aggravate its inherent imbalance. © 2022 LLC Ecological Help.

In this article, we present the results of a study focusing on how the transversal competence of multiliteracy is contextually defined in Finnish local curricula in the disciplines of mathematics and social studies. The article offers new insights into the discussion between content- and competence-based educations by introducing the concept of disciplinary contextualisation. Based on the qualitatively analysed data, four different types of disciplinary contextualisation are presented and further discussed. The study also engages with the discussion in the field of multiliteracy by offering insights into the ways in which multiliteracy is rationalised, defined, and developed in the analysed disciplines. Multiliteracy contextualisations share features, but also differences, between the disciplines, illustrating the importance of taking into account the disciplinary perspective when discussing the development of competences in basic education. © 2020 The Author(s).

How competence-based education has been developed and implemented varies across education systems in Europe. The European Commission defines digital competence as one of the eight key competence standards for lifelong learning. The European digital competence framework DigComp provides a comprehensive and exhaustive framework for citizens; it has the potential to be adapted to the needs of specific target groups. Nevertheless, no current research has focused on the need for developing a common framework for primary and secondary education. To address this gap we present a digital competence framework for European primary and secondary students. DigComp and a set of European frameworks are analysed in this paper. Combining categorical analysis with the collaboration of teachers and experts in the field, we define performance criteria and components that contribute to competence by five categories, providing a framework to promote the acquisition and evaluation of digital competence. This framework can be implemented in any EU country, it incorporates the most recent theoretical advances in research on information and communication technologies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,,"Anderson-Levitt, K., Global flows of competence-based approaches in primary and secondary education (2017) Cahiers de La Recherche Sur L’éducation et Les Savoirs, 16, p. 2017. , http://journals.openedition.org/cres/3010; Calvani, A., Fini, A., Ranieri, M., Digital competence in K-12: Theoretical models, assessment tools and empirical research (2010) Anàlisi: Quaderns de Comunicació i Cultura, 40, pp. 157-171; Charmaz, K., (2006) Constructing grounded theory, , Sage Publications; Coulby, C., Hennessey, S., Davies, N., Fuller, R., The use of mobile technology for work-based assessment: The student experience (2011) British Journal of Educational Technology, 42, pp. 251-265; Dailey, R., History of competency-based education (2016) Communication: Journalism Education Today, 49 (4), pp. 46-47; (2019) Digital economy and society index report 2019.

Framed by curriculum and didaktik education traditions theoretically, the findings reveal that introduction of key competences and associated learning outcomes in 2011 marked the most substantial departure from the previously content-based curriculum policy in place. It is concluded that European education trends provided the macro narrative and legitimation for the 2011 competence-based curriculum reform in Kosovo. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, there is a lack of empirical instruments aimed at assessing preservice teachers’ opinion of competency-based policies, their self-evaluation regarding such policies, and their understanding of the intended rationale behind competency mandates. Instruments with similar aims in other contexts suffer psychometric shortcomings. Therefore, the authors’ aim was to design an instrument to examine primary preservice teachers’ beliefs about the role of key competencies in education, self-evaluate their understanding of the concept of key competencies, and determine if they understood the intended interdisciplinary focus. A three-phase pilot (n = 295, n = 277, n = 263) was carried out with each phase aimed at progressively improving the instrument’s psychometric soundness. Drawing from data obtained from the third pilot, the psychometric scale properties are reported for a much-needed assessment tool. © 2021 Teacher Development.",educational policy; key competencies; policy evaluation; Primary preservice teacher attitudes; self-evaluation,,Universitat de Barcelona,"Ajayi, L., High School Teachers’ Perspectives on the English Language Arts Common Core State Standards: An Exploratory Study (2016) Educational Research for Policy and Practice, 15 (1), pp. 1-25; Beck, J., Czerniak, C.M., Lumpe, A.T., An Exploratory Study of Teachers’ Beliefs Regarding the Implementation of Constructivism in Their Classrooms (2000) Journal of Science Teacher Education, 11 (4), pp. 323-343; Bickel, R., (2007) Multilevel Analysis for Applied Research: It’s Just Regression, , New York: Guilford; Biggs, B.K., “Teacher Adherence and Its Relation to Teacher Attitudes and Student Outcomes in an Elementary School-Based Violence Prevention Program.” (2008) School Psychology Review, 37 (4), pp. 533-549. , E.

An integrated STEAM education is one potentially useful methodological approach to assist in this matter. Using design research, an integrated STEAM approach was designed, implemented and assessed with 121 students in their sixth year of primary education. Its effect was analysed through a mixed methods study. The results show that the students obtain a high level of competence after the approach is applied in all of the key competences, with an emphasis on the level attained by girls in scientific skills. These results seem to reinforce the hypothesis that an integrated STEAM education is effective as a possible avenue for improving competence development in the primary education years as it didactically responds to the complexity of today’s world. © 2021 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.",attitudes towards science; integrated STEAM education; key competences; mixed methods research; primary education,,"Consejería de Educación, Junta de Castilla y León; Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España; Junta de Castilla y León","Aguilera Morales, D., Martín-Páez, T., Valdivia-Rodríguez, V., Ruiz-Delgado, A., Willians-Pinto, L., Vílchez-González, J.M., Perales-Palacios, F.J., La enseñanza de las ciencias basada en indagación.

Since its emergence, this notion has been strongly opposed by a certain number of teachers, unions and researchers. To understand how competence-based education finally prevailed, I take into account the fundamentally polysemic nature of this notion. After pointing out its origins, I examine how its different meanings have been synthesised within the Common Core established in 2005. I then study the contradictions to which the implementation of this hybrid object has given rise, before analysing the new compromise that was found in the 2015 reform. To do this, I use the data from numerous archives and a series of interviews with the main actors of curriculum reforms in France since the 1980s. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Competence; education reform; France; new public management; pedagogy; progressive education; school curriculum,comparative study; curriculum; education reform; higher education; implementation process; policy implementation; teaching; France,,"Anderson-Levitt, K., Global Flows of Competence-based Approaches in Primary and Secondary Education (2017) Cahiers de la recherche sur l’éducation et les savoirs, 16, pp. 47-72; Bezez, P., (2009) Réinventer l’État: Les réformes de l’administration française (1962–2008), , Paris: Presses universitaires de France; Bouchez, A., (1994) Livre blanc des collèges, , Paris: Ministère de l’Éducation nationale, ed; Bourdieu, P., (2005) The Social Structures of the Economy, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Bourdieu, P., (2014) On the State.

Simultaneously, Kosovo underwent major political, social, and cultural changes after the war in 1999, and the declaration of independence in 2008. This article relies on document analysis and uses civic competences definitions in Kosovo and European Commission frameworks to compare conceptions of citizenship for democratic life along three theoretical constructs, namely personally responsible/individualist, participatory/social, and justice-oriented/political. It coins loud borrowing to describe the policy flow into Kosovo education, specifically focusing on the latest 2011 competence-based curriculum reform. The findings show that Kosovo’s curriculum alignment with the European Commission key competence approach in 2011 served larger political goals and aspirations to brand Kosovars as ‘Young Europeans.’ In addition, personally responsible/individualist conception and participatory/social conception of citizenship are dominant in Kosovo, as well as in European Commission frameworks. © 2020 The Author(s).

Specifically, it explores how the thinking around competency, spearheaded by international organisations and experts, has led to the development and deployment of a particular notion of global competency. Drawing on critical policy research, I examine three international policy events in which experts convened to discuss, debate, and co-construct ideas related to competencies in education. I argue that by structuring the assessment of knowledge and fixing meanings, the OECD, along with networks of experts, has created and diffused a particular social imaginary of a globally competent learner. Given the complexity and uncertainty of the world today, increasing the global and intercultural knowledge and awareness of the world’s students is vitally important. Yet, with so much at stake, researchers must critically examine the processes through which educational futures are being imagined while at the same time, pursuing more equitable and inclusive education policy-making within and beyond the nation-state. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",education policy-making; epistemic communities; Global competence; key competencies; OECD; PISA; social imaginaries,education policy; educational development; expert system; global perspective; learning; OECD; policy making,,"Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization, , Ninth Printing ed, University of Minnesota Press, (Public Worlds, 1)., Minneapolis; (2018) Teaching for Global Competence in a Rapidly Changing World, , New York: OECD Publishing, Paris/Asia Society; Auld, E., Morris, P., Science by Streetlight and the OECD’s Measure of Global Competence: A New Yardstick for Internationalisation?

This study compares the rationales, content, and curricula design of both countries’ key competencies frameworks and explores the possibility of reciprocal learning. Although their frameworks have certain similarities, significant differences have arisen due to cultural factors. The Chinese framework follows the Confucian tradition, emphasising moral education, political inclinations, transferring general competencies to specific-subject ones, and integrating key competencies in the national curriculum. The US framework follows the pragmatic tradition, emphasising generic skills and economic needs. Some US states have attempted to revise curriculum standards or incorporate 21st century skills by identifying their alignment with Common Core State Standards. Both frameworks have deficiencies and face challenges in implementation, and they can learn from each other. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",21st century skills; global competition; Key competencies; moral priority; skill priority,comparative study; competition (economics); concentration (composition); conceptual framework; education; knowledge based system; student; technological development; China; United States,,"Ananiadou, K., Claro, M., (2009), 21st Century Skills and Competences for New Millennium Learners OECD Countries,.

Participants were 1408 Spanish Primary and Secondary School teachers (719 women and 689 men). Participants answered an ad hoc questionnaire consisting of a 23-item, five-factor scale (beliefs about the theoretical model, level of implementation of the model, difficulties in implementing the model, resources, and professional development). The questionnaire was sent through an on-line application to all Spanish Primary and Secondary Schools. The results show that teachers perceive the importance of curricular change although their expectations are negative regarding its implementation in classrooms. They are committed to the application of the CBCM but there is still a great demand for training and contextual conditions need to be improved. Regarding the factors analyzed, women have a better consideration of the degree of application of teaching strategies or the uniformity in the implementation of CBCM, while men score significantly higher in available resources. Primary school teachers have a more favorable perception in most of the items than secondary school teachers. It is necessary to address all these difficulties observed by teachers if educational reforms are intended to have a real impact on the results of the educational process. © 2020 Grupo de Investigacion FORCE.

Design/Approach/Methods: Against the backdrop of international and Chinese policy and the practice of key-competences-based education, this article focuses on a critical discourse analysis of this educational movement in China. Findings: China places great emphasis on the personal, cultural, and moral dimensions in generating a framework of competences, paying considerable attention to the well-being of children; hence it currently endeavors to provide a consistent educational framework to educate the young for the all-round development. However, three challenges are salient: the dilemma between Core-Suyang (Core-Competence) and the education for all-round development of the young, the limitations of design of “subject core-competences,” and a lack of consideration of subjectification as purpose of education. Originality/Value: Education which merely focuses on a list of key-competences might not only exclude non-key-competences but also exclude something unforeseen and unknown in the process of educational adventure. It is therefore suggested that a holistic education needs to be engaged in with an encompassing and dynamic view of purpose(s) of education, in which the education for subjectification is at stake in our educational endeavor. © The Author(s) 2020.",Curriculum;

The last decade has shown that digital competences are an important group of key competences for every employee and every organization. The purpose of this study is to present results of surveys on digital competences of Polish and Slovak students. Generally, results show that assessment of the level of digital competence of Polish students is not only higher but also less diverse. The rationale for addressing the subject of digital competences is its significance, constant changes resulting from development of ICT and the need to improve quality of life of individuals and organizations in the modern digital world. In this questionnaire, the students were asked to evaluate their level of understanding both existing and non-existing terms from the ICT area. The results have shown that there are significant differences between the questioned groups of students especially in case of IT competences. © 2020 by the authors.",Digital competences; Digital world; Information competences; IT competences; Qualitative analysis,comparative study; digitization; empirical analysis; information and communication technology; quality of life; questionnaire survey; research method; student; Poland [Central Europe]; Slovakia,Vedecká Grantová Agentúra MŠVVaŠ SR a SAV,"Ayale-Perez, T., Joo-Nagata, J., The digital culture of students of pedagogy specialising in the humanities in Santiago de Chile (2019) Comput.

Relying on PRISMA methodology and framed by discursive institutionalism, and curriculum and Didaktik traditions theoretically, the review was guided by two overarching research questions, focusing first on how much and what educational research on CBE approaches is available, and secondly, primarily in the present article, on the definitions that are reported in CBE research in terms of explicit and systematic versus implicit and tacit references, main educational perspectives/paradigms and academic versus applied orientation. Findings show Spain and New Zealand with most articles related to educational research on CBE, and identify four sources of competence definitions: OECD/DeSeCo, European Commission, national policy documents and the academic literature. It is concluded that there is still unfinished business for educational researchers in critically engaging with framing and defining competences for the twenty-first century, their causes, impact and consequences for schooling and learning internationally, as well as how CBE is recontextualised into specific national contexts. © 2020, The Author(s).",Competence-based education; Competences/competencies; Curriculum policy; Systematic review,,,"Anderson-Levitt, K., Global flows of competence-based approaches in primary and secondary education (2017) Cahiers de la Recherche Sur l’éducation et les Savoirs, 16, pp. 47-72; Becker, G.S., Investment in human capital: a theoretical analysis (1962) The Journal of Political Economy, pp. 9-49; (1990) The Structuring of Pedagogic Discourse, , London & New York: Routledge; Bernstein, B., (1996) Pedagogy, Symbolic Control and Identity: Theory, Research, Critique, , London & Washington: Taylor & Francis; Buscà Donet, F., Ambròs Pallares, A., Burset Burillo, S., Bibliometric characteristics of articles on key competences indexed in ERIC from 1990 to 2013 (2017) European Journal of Teacher Education, 40 (2), pp. 144-156; (2019) Oxford Online Dictionary, , https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/competence, Retrieved from; (2019) In Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, , https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/competency#synonyms, Retrieved from; Davies, P., The relevance of systematic reviews to educational policy and practice (2000) Oxford Review of Education, 26 (3-4), pp. 365-378; Delors, J., (1996) Learning: the treasure within, , UNESCO, Paris; Deng, Z., Luke, A., Subject matter: Defining and theorizing school subjects (2008) The Sage Handbook of Curriculum and Instruction (, pp. 66-87. , F.

First, to determine the impact of a Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Education program on school performance amongst primary education students. Second, to identify the potential benefits of this program on the key competences of university students in Primary Education Teacher Training. The primary education students' sub-sample, after being matched on key covariates, was randomly assigned either to the experimental (N = 25) or control group (N = 25). The university students' sub-sample consisted of 26 students self-selected from the Primary Education Teacher Training degree. The intervention consisted of 20 two-hour weekly sessions of highly structured after-school tutoring delivered by previously trained university students. Although statistical significance was not reached for the hypotheses tested, notably, the results showed between small and moderate effect sizes (i.e., magnitude and direction of the program impact) for primary education students on core STEM subjects (e.g., mathematics d = 0.29, natural science d = 0.26), and for university students on some key employability competencies (e.g., action orientation d = 0.27 or team orientation d = 0.54). © 2020 by the authors.",Engineering and mathematics (STEM) education; Initial teacher training; School performance; Science; Service learning; Social sustainability; Technology; Tutoring,detection method; mathematics; primary education; student; sustainability; teacher training; university sector,"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey; Universidad de Granada; Junta de Andalucía","(2014) Statistics and Indicators.

First, we critically discuss the social and digital exclusion of young people. We then describe our approach - that includes participatory action research methods that are influenced by the work of Dewey and Freire, and operate as a process of complex intervention. This supports the inclusive co-production of radio content in ways that support non-formal learning in two EU contexts–the UK and Portugal. We then summarise and compare a qualitative investigation of RadioActive101. This showed positive results, with important similarities and differences between the two contexts. Participants reported that RadioActive101 was motivating and contributed to the development of contemporary skills, and also stimulated improvements in psychosocial dimensions such as confidence (self-efficacy) and self-esteem. This investigation informed the development of an original recognition system for non-formal learning that maps EU Key Competences for Lifelong Learning to radio practices and activities that are recognised through electronic badges. Our reflections emphasise that in order to support the non-formal learning of socially excluded young people we must foreground our attention to fostering psychosocial dimensions alongside developing contemporary competences. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",contemporary skills; internet radio; Non-formal learning; pedagogical issues; psychosocial dimensions; socially excluded young people,,European Commission,"Bandura, A., (1977) Social Learning Theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Bandura, A., Self-efficacy Mechanism in Human Agency (1982) American Psychologist, 37 (2), pp. 122-147; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The Exercise of Control, , New York: Freeman; (2016) From Inclusion to Empowerment: The Barclays Digital Development Index, , https://digitalindex.barclays/, 1st ed.

The article distinguishes between policy-critical thinking and civic-critical thinking. Relying on analyses of curriculum and policy documents, it is concluded that while in the Swedish context critical thinking competence (or ability) seems to be much more implicit than explicit, in Kosovo, the national curriculum makes explicit references to thinking competences as a form of policy-critical thinking and civic competencies as a form of civic-critical thinking. Thus, students in both contexts have opportunities to develop critical thinking skills. Furthermore, Sweden emerges as a divergent case and Kosovo as a convergent case with regard to transnational policy flow research paradigms. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The participants were 1,010 teachers from 110 schools. The results showed that the teachers need training on this new competency-based approach to teaching, learning and evaluation. The hypothetical prediction model confirmed the high predictiveness of pre-service teacher education and continuous professional development regarding the proper development of the main elements of competency-based learning which contribute to achieving the purposes of today’s education. One of the possible recommendations that could facilitate the inclusion of the key competences in the curriculum according to their perception is teacher training geared towards pedagogical models adapted to the reality of teaching today which optimize teachers’ professional performance and students’ academic achievement. © 2019 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje",Curriculum; Key competences; Professional development; Structural equation modelling; Teacher perception; Teaching-learning process,,Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad,"Álvarez-Castrillón, J.A., Rodríguez-Marín, A., Álvarez-Arregui, E., Enfoque por competencias y resultados escolares.

In 2006, the European Union defined digital competence as one of eight key competences for lifelong learning. The terms digital literacies and digital competence have since been used interchangeably, particularly in policy documents concerning education and the digitalization of educational systems and teaching. However, whether these concepts carry similar meanings, and are understood in a similar way, across languages and cultures is not self-evident. By taking the curricula in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Norway as examples, this article attempts to clarify similarities and differences in how the concepts are interpreted, as well as what implications this has for the digitalization of education. The analyses reveal that different terms are used in the curricula in the different countries, which are connected to themes or interdisciplinary issues to be incorporated into school subjects. The conceptualizations of the terms share a common emphasis on societal issues and a critical approach, highlighting a particular Nordic interpretation of digital literacies and digital competence. © 2019 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).",Bildung; Curricula; Digital competence; Digital literacies; Education; Literacy,,,"Ala-Mutka, K., Punie, Y., Redecker, C., (2008) Dig-Ital Competence for Lifelong Learning, , http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC48708.TN.pdf, No. 48708).

After reviewing the literature, we designed an initial questionnaire with 37 five-point Likert-type items. This was then reviewed by a panel of experts. A pilot test was conducted with 100 participants using exploratory factor analysis. This resulted in a final scale with 23 items across five factors (beliefs about the theoretical model, level of implementation of the model, difficulties in implementing the model, resources and professional development). To verify, using new data, the level of fit of the measurement model generated by the first sample, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis, and, subsequently, a confirmatory factor analysis with structural equations on a sample of 1408 respondents. Acceptable levels of internal consistency and model fit were obtained. The result is a scale which is rapidly and easily administered. It demonstrates good criterion validity in explaining teachers' beliefs about the competence-based curriculum model, and thus reveals teachers' perceptions of the impact of this curricular reform. © NAER Journal of New Approaches in Educational Research 2018.",Competence; Questionnaire; Reliability; Teacher; Validity,,,"Adelman, N., Walking-Eagle, K., Los docentes, el tiempo y la reforma escolar (2003) Replantear el cambio educativo.

The Key Competencies of Mobile Learning Scale (KCMLS) was determined via confirmatory factor analysis to have four dimensions: team collaboration, creative thinking, critical thinking and problem solving, and communication. The research subjects are 815 students from the elementary school that participate in M-learning programme in Taiwan. The research results show that students have better self-awareness in team collaboration and creative thinking, but have worse self-awareness in critical thinking and problem solving. This study also found that there was no significant difference between genders in the KCMLS, but students who study in the schools that committed in M-learning longer have higher awareness in all dimensions than students who study in the schools that committed to M-learning in fewer years. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",communication; creative thinking; critical thinking and problem solving; M-learning; team collaboration,,,"Amiel, I., Simon, D., Merin, O., Ziv, A., Mobile in situ simulation as a tool for evaluation and improvement of trauma treatment in the emergency department (2016) Journal of Surgical Education, 73 (1), pp. 121-128; Bart, W.M., Hokanson, B., Sahin, I., Abdelsamea, M.A., An investigation of the gender differences in creative thinking abilities among 8th and 11th grade students (2015) Thinking Skills and Creativity, 17, pp. 17-24; Biddix, J.P., Chung, C.J., Park, H.W., Faculty use and perception of mobile information and communication technology (m-ICT) for teaching practices (2016) Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 53 (4), pp. 375-387; Chang, H.P., Chen, C.C., Guo, G.J., Cheng, Y.J., Lin, C.Y., Jen, T.H., The development of a competence scale for learning science: Inquiry and communication (2011) International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education, 9 (5), pp. 1213-1233; Chang, W.C., Pan, E.C., Huang, Y.J., Constructing a M-learning system to support creative thinking program (2013) Journal of Information Technology and Applications, 7 (2), pp. 45-51; Chang, Y.S., Chien, Y.H., Yu, K.C., Lin, H.C., Chen, M.Y.C., Students'innovative environmental perceptions and creative effectivenesss in cloud-based M-learning (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, 63, pp. 988-994; Chen, H.J., Wang, Y.H., Age stereotypes of older primary teachers in Taiwan (2012) Educational Gerontology, 38 (5), pp. 362-371; Chu, H.C., Hwang, G.J., Tsai, C.C., A knowledge engineering approach to developing mindtools for context-aware ubiquitous learning (2010) Computers & Education, 54 (1), pp. 289-297; Christie, B., Beames, S., Higgins, P., Context, culture and critical thinking: Scottish secondary school teachers' and pupils' experiences of outdoor learning (2016) British Educational Research Journal, 42 (3), pp. 417-437; Crompton, H., Olszewski, B., Bielefeldt, T., The M-learning training needs of educators in technology-enabled environments (2016) Professional Development in Education, 42 (3), pp. 482-501; Csikszentmihalyi, M., Society, culture, and person: A systems view of creativity (1988) The nature of creativity, pp. 325-339. , In, R.

This observation method allowed us to highlight key elements like the population, educational level, topics, etc. to focus whether this literature contributes towards implementing competence-based education. The findings of key competence-based articles confirm that competence discourse in education has become a highly rated topic of debate from 1999 to 2013. In the two last decades, there has been a gradual increase in articles based on research combined with a decline in articles of a descriptive nature. The main contributions of articles on competency-based education are significantly in line with topics related to reflection on competence discourse and education policies that should be implemented. There is still a clear need for publications which provide examples and empirical evidence aimed at developing basic competences. © 2017 Association for Teacher Education in Europe.",competence-based curricula; competence-based education; Key competences,,,"Aguerrondo, I., (2009) Complex Knowledge and Education Competences, , http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/Working_Papers/knowledge_compet_ibewpci_8_en.pdf, Geneve: UNESCO-IBE; Ambròs, A., Developing the Audiovisual Competence in the New Catalan Educational Programme (2014) Media Literacy and Intercultural Dialogue.

By examining the content validity (n = 35 experts), comprehension (n = 173 students) and construct (n = 523 students) of the instrument, the results showed correct psychometric quality, internal consistency, reliability and adequacy of the structural model: χ2/df = 2.08, TLI = 0.88, CFI = 0.90, GFI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.04, and SRMR = 0.04. The final version of the Questionnaire on Perceived Competency-based Learning of primary school students (#ICOMpri1) includes eight dimensions and 27 items. The results showed a high perceived competency-based learning of primary school students. This is therefore a valid and reliable instrument that provides a more subjective and real vision of primary students' academic performance. Nevertheless, future studies should analyse the criterion-related validity by comparing perception results with those of international academic achievement. © 2017 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.",Academic achievement; Key competences; Psychometrics; Scale; Teaching-learning process,,,"Álvarez-García, D., Núñez, J.C., Rodríguez, C., Álvarez, L., Dobarro, A., Propiedades psicométricas del cuestionario de violencia escolar-revisado (CUVE-R) (2011) Revista de Psicodidáctica, 16, pp. 59-83; Bentler, P.M., (2006) EQS, Structural Equations Program Manual, , Encino, CA: Multivariate Statistical Software; Bolívar, A., Pereyra, M.A., (2006) El Proyecto DeSeCo Sobre la Definición y Selección de Competencias Clave, , Introducción a la edición española.

Since then, key competences have been integrated into the official curriculum in Spain. The objectives of the present study are: a) to describe the strategies used most frequently by physical education teachers to incorporate key competences in their programmes; and b) to identify the profiles of teachers and schools that promote the inclusion of key competences in their physical education programmes. Data were collected via a questionnaire administered to a sample of 2051 physical education teachers in primary and secondary schools in Spain. The results show that while teachers include key competences in their programmes, they do not usually do so explicitly. The competences most frequently included are: social and citizenship skills; autonomy and personal initiative; learning to learn; and knowledge of, and interaction with, the physical world. To develop these competences, lesson plans often aim to integrate knowledge, skills and attitudes, apply problem-solving approaches, and foster the transfer of learning to everyday life. The lack of interdisciplinarity emerges as a negative aspect. Factors favouring the inclusion of competences are the provision of competence-based training for teachers and the presence of a coordination system for dealing with competences in the school. The conclusion drawn is that merely including key competences in the official curriculum is not enough; reinforcement and correction of all the aspects mentioned are essential to ensure that adequate attention is paid to competences in physical education programmes. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",curriculum; Key competences; programming; school physical education,,,"Bisquerra, R., Educación física, competencias básicas y educación (2011) EmásF: Revista Digital de Educación Física, 2 (11), pp. 4-6; Blázquez, D., Sebastiani, E., (2009) Enseñar por Competencias en Educación Física, , Barcelona, INDE; Boutin, G., L’approche par compétences en éducation: Un amalgame paradigmatique (2004) Connexions, 81 (1), pp. 25-41; Buscà, F., Capllonch, M., De las competencias básicas a las competencias profesionales transversales: Aportaciones desde el ámbito de la educación física (2008) Tándem.

As teacher educators we were interested in finding out which teaching competences teachers consider are most necessary to facilitate learning of student key competences. Therefore, we conducted a study with a sample of 286 in-service primary education teachers, using a questionnaire specifically prepared for this purpose. A descriptive and factorial statistical analysis of the resulting data was then performed. The results show that teachers place the highest value on the educational capability to promote student motivation, effort and responsibility in the development of key competences. Also they consider the competence to teach a foreign language as the least necessary. A cross-functional approach, running parallel to the integrating nature of key competences in the school curriculum, was not identified for teaching competences. Finally, certain implications are presented derived from the study. © 2016 Teacher Development.",initial teacher education; key competences; primary education; school curriculum; teaching competences,,,"Abelló, L., La colaboración con los padres y otros agentes sociales [Collaboration of Parents and Other Social Agents] (2007) El desarrollo de competencias docentes en la formación del profesorado[The Development of Teaching Competences in Teacher Training], pp. 113-127. , López A., (ed), Madrid: Ministerio de Educación; (2004) White Paper, Graduate Degree in Teaching, 1. , http://www.aneca.es/modal_eval/conver_docs_titulos.html, Madrid: ANECA; (2005) La adecuación de las titulaciones de maestro al espacio europeo de educación superior, , http://www.aneca.es/var/media/150404/libroblanco_jun05_magisterio1.pdf; Beijaard, D., De Vries, Y., Building Expertise: A Process Perspective on the Development or Change of Teachers’ Beliefs (1997) European Journal of Teacher Education, 20, pp. 243-255; Beijaard, D., Meijer, P.C., Verloop, N., Reconsidering Research on Teachers’ Professional Identity (2004) Teaching and Teacher Education, 20, pp. 107-128; Cano, E., Las competencias de los docentes [Teacher Competencies] (2007) El desarrollo de competencias docentes en la formación del profesorado[The Development of Teaching Competences in Teacher Training], pp. 33-60. , López A., (ed), Madrid: Ministerio de Educación; Cochran-Smith, M., Feiman-Nemser, S., McIntyre, D.J., Demers, K., (2008) Handbook of Research on Teacher Education Enduring Questions in Changing Contexts, , New York and Manassas: Routledge/Taylor & Francis Group and the Association of Teacher Educators; De-Juanas, A., Fernández, P., Martín del Pozo, R., González, M., Pesquero, E., Sánchez, E., Comparative Study of the Evaluation of Professional Competencies by Experienced and Trainee Spanish Primary Teachers (2009) European Journal of Teacher Education, 32 (4), pp. 437-454; Fernández, P., González, M., De-Juanas, A., Martín del Pozo, R., Reflection about the Potential for Learning Reading and Writing Activities Required of College Students (2011) Revista de Psicología y Educación, 6, pp. 111-120; Fox, D., (1969) The Research Process in Education, , New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston; (2010) Encuesta sobre formación y desarrollo profesional de los docentes en España, , http://www.fuhem.es/educacion/; Gimeno, J., (2009) Educar por competencias, ¿qué hay de nuevo?[Competencies Based Education, What’s New?], , Madrid: Morata; González, J., Wagennar, R., (2003) Tuning.

Students are now more than ever the axis around which the university system orbits. The competences that students should acquire during their studies include transversal competences, which are those competences related to leadership skills, problem solving, and teamwork, highly valued by labor market. This is particularly important in engineering, as these skills can influence the selection of one candidate over another. So, the evaluation and teaching of these kinds of competences are now some of the main challenges facing university professors as the corresponding learning objectives need to be set and assessed, both for study programs as well as for each individual subject, and this process is new for teachers. Focusing precisely on this aspect, our work, based on an empirical study conducted with a sample of 102 engineering students from the University Center of Merida, uses a tool to measure the progress of such students in different transversal competences. This tool not only allows us to evaluate the level of competence development, but also allows us to detect students’ areas of weakness in cross-curricular training that can then be addressed. © 2015, FACTEACHEREDUCATION.

In particular, our working hypothesis is that focusing children’s and young people’s learning towards the realization of their well-being supports and enables creativity. But it also requires, firstly, addressing how children perceive, engage with, and express creativity in different ways and, secondly, nurturing the development of core capacities to, in turn, underpin their capacity to develop key competences and skills in formal and non-formal learning settings. In recommending that education systems take the well-being of children as their central purpose, we are suggesting that there are capacities, ranging from personal qualities to behavioural skills, which are necessary for the development of the personal resources to enable lifelong and life-wide learning. © 2014 University of Cambridge, Faculty of Education.",children; competence; core capacities; creativity; diversity; education; learning; well-being,,,"Awartani, M., Vince Whitman, C., Gordon, J., (2007) The voice of children, student well-being and the school environment.

The aim of this study was to identify students' ability to use ICT according to the competence aims, and to examine factors that can predict students' digital competence. A sample of 1793 students and 125 school leaders from 125 schools was used. The findings show variation in digital competence both between students and between schools. Results from a multilevel analysis showed that higher levels of mastery orientation and self-efficacy (i.e., motivation) and the students' family background (i.e., language integration and the number of books at home) were predictors of students' levels of digital competence. Additionally, when school leaders reported higher levels of culture for professional development among the teachers at school, increased levels of digital competence were found among students. Challenges for schools and teachers to support students' motivation and to emphasize digital inclusion still prevail. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Culture for professional development; Digital competence; Family background; Mastery orientation; Self-efficacy,,,"Ala-Mutka, K., (2011) Mapping digital competence: Towards a conceptual understanding, , Luxembourg: European Union; Avidov-Ungar, O., Eshet-Alkakay, Y., Teachers in a World of Change: Teachers' Knowledge and Attitudes Towards the Implementation of Innovative Technologies in Schools (2011), p. 7; Aviram, R., Eshet-Alkalay, Y., Towards a theory of digital literacy: Three scenarios for the next steps (2006) European Journal of Open, Distance and E-Learning, , http://www.eurodl.org/materials/contrib/2006/Aharon_Aviram.htm; Balanskat, A., Gerthsch, C.A., Digital Skills Working Group.

The subjects were 212 students from 4 schools in Kanchanaburi, Chiang Mai, Mae Hong Son, and Si-Saked provinces that were enrolled in the 2010 academic year. The PBL using ICT approach was used as the research tool. The data collecting instruments were lesson plans, students’ journals, semi-structured interviews, and social networking where students’ learning artifacts and products were collected (nectecpbl.ning.com). Content analysis and triangulation methods were used to analyze the data. The results showed that students were able to perform five key competencies in communication capability, thinking capability, problem solving capability, capability in applying life skills, and capability in technological application. Moreover, the students learned the content in the learning areas of Science, Mathematics, Foreign Languages, Health and Physical Education, and Occupations and Technology. The research findings revealed that the use of PBL using ICT can help to develop students’ abilities to communicate ideas, problem solving, life skills, and abilities to use technology, as well as their learning in content of the subject area. © 2015, International Journal of Research in Education and Science.

It traces key ideas, policy recommendations, peer learning and documents which underscore the relevance of teacher quality for education improvement, as recently stressed the European Commission Communication and Staff Working Documents Rethinking Education. The intertwining of teacher competence frameworks with other areas of education policy is outlined - key competences school education, the quality of initial teacher education, and the continuous professional development of teachers - teasing out reasons for their central role. Some insights from research and peer learning then explore key implications the defining and implementing of teacher competence frameworks national education systems. A comparative viewpoint further analyses current policy trends about teacher competences across European national contexts, discourse and practice. order to do so, a framework of analysis takes into account system features as key variables affecting national policy - roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, governance and education cultures, and the status of the teaching profession. Across the variety of policy practices, the analysis endeavours to trace some emerging patterns and trends, highlighting paradigmatic national examples, with some food for thought. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Comparative analysis; European education policies; Globalisation studies; Teacher competences; Teacher education,,,"Ball, D.L., (2003) Mathematics the 21st Century: what mathematics knowledge is needed for teaching mathematics?, , Washington D.C., US Department of Education); Biesta, G., Values and ideals teachers' professional judgement (2009) Changing Teacher Professionalism, pp. 184-193. , S.

The need to teach these competencies at school is justified socially and pedagogically, and the way in which these competencies are implemented in Spanish and European school curricula is described. Spain's main political actions to promote social-emotional education are then described. The article concludes that for these programs to be effective, they must overcome a double challenge related to the practical implementation of competence-based curricula and transversal competencies assessment. Consequently, Europe as well as Spain must redouble their efforts (economic, instrumental, and in terms of assessment) to achieve their educational goals. © Korean Educational Development Institute 2013.",Civic competencies; Comprehensive education; Educational policy; Learning for well-being; Social-emotional competencies,,,"El entrenamiento de la inteligencia emocional puede prevenir conductas agresivas en la escuela (2011) Servicio De Informacion Y Noticias Cientificas, , http://www.agenciasinc.es/Noticias/El-entrenamiento-de-la-inteligencia-emocional-puedeprevenir-conductas-agresivas-en-la-escuela, Andalucia Innova, Fabruary, SINC], Retrieved from, In Spanish; Awartani, M., Whitman, C.V., Gordon, J., Developing instruments to capture young people's perceptions of how school as a learning environment affects their well-being (2008) European Journal of Education, 43 (1), pp. 51-70; Banati, P., Alexander, G., (2012) The Structural Determinants of Child Well-being, , http://www.unicef-irc.org/publication678, Florence (Italy): UNICEF Office of Research/Innocenti.

This research analyses this situation of vulnerability and evaluates the possible factors that lead to it, such as personal and educational factors, behaviours, perception of mastery of key competences or guidance processes, studying several of them in a deeper way. It examines what kind of training alternatives these young people have in order to minimize their risk of exclusion and to improve their inclusion in society, labour market and educational context. The research is developed in Cataluña area. Using a mixed methodology (qualitative and quantitative) and a model for the triangulation or sources (228 young people, 16 tutors, and 9 entrepreneurs) and instruments for the data collection (questionnaires applied to young people, interviews to tutors and entrepreneurs, and documental analysis of 17 employment training programmes in 7 municipalities of Barcelona), this research demonstrates that academic failure is the result of multiple and interdependent factors and dimensions. It also shows that employment training and guidance programmes can be considered as a 'second chance' alternatives to access to the labour market or to retake educational programs.",Educational failure; Employment opportunities; Employment training programmes; Key competences; Unskilled young people,,,"Adame, M.T., Salvà, F., Abandono escolar prematuro y transición a la vida activa en una economía turística: el caso de Baleares (2010) Revista de Educación, 351, pp. 185-210; Albert, M.J., (2007) La Investigación Educativa.

First, I review the discussion of KCs in the writings by the OECD-affiliated researchers and other OECD documents. In so doing, I identify a marked decoupling of KCs from the initial lifelong learning policy framework. Then, I situate the discussion of KCs within the sociological critique of the new mode of learning deemed essential for a 'knowledge society'. I identify KCs' potential to naturalize the (re)production of inequalities through schooling and argue that this can be further compounded by the extraction of KCs from the lifelong learning policy discourse. Finally, I ground these expositions in the specific policy context of Japanese education, highlighting how KCs and its decoupled articulation pose a difficult policy dilemma for Japan's Ministry of Education attempting to address the widening class-based inequalities through schooling. Hence, this study critiques the contemporary school curriculum reform driven by KCs by tracing the flow of this concept from the international policy discourse down to the level of a national policy development. In conclusion, I call for curriculum studies to recognize the increasingly globalized curricular policy context and develop strategies for the new challenges of educational inequalities that confront us today. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",educational inequality; Japanese education; key competencies; OECD; PISA,,,"Apple, M.W., (2000) Official Knowledge, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: Routledge; Ball, S.J., (2008) The Education Debate, , Bristol, Bristol,: Policy Press; Bernstein, B., (2000) Pedagogy, Symbolic Control and Identity, , rev ed, New York, NY, New York, NY,: Rowman & Littlefield; Bernstein, B., From pedagogies to knowledge (2001) Towards a Sociology of Pedagogy, pp. 363-368. , In: Morais A., Neves I., Davies B., Daniels H., editors New York, NY, New York, NY,: Peter Lang; Bernstein, B., (2003) The Structuring of Pedagogic Discourse, Volume IV: Class, Codes and Control, , London, London,: Routledge; Bieber, T., Martens, K., The OECD PISA study as a soft power in education?

Analysis of the original EU documents on this topic provides much food for thought that has only rarely been reflected in educational, academic and political discussions. This paper offers a thoughtful synthesis of the concept and implications of competence-based learning in general and the key competences in particular. Placing this new approach within the framework of today’s society and the lifelong learning approach is the first objective the authors propose; this would facilitate a deeper understanding of the competence-based learning approach, its significance and its relevance and above all would help to overcome the widespread idea in education that the competence-based approach involves no major changes from the status quo. The authors warn again pedagogical idealism: There are risks and challenges in this new educational proposal that must be considered. Altogether, the authors argue that we must not waste any further opportunities to really adjust our educational system to competence-based learning and, above all, the acquisition of key competences by all citizens of the European Union at the end of their compulsory education. © 2013 Ministry Education and Science.

The article discusses the issues and challenges posed by the CBC for teachers in the daily life of the classroom. Philosophical ideas about the purpose of education vary because they are driven by ideological positions. Consequently the nature and structure of the curriculum influenced by the stance adopted inevitably affects approaches to teaching and learning. It is contended that changes to the curricula in the case study schools have revealed tensions between traditional approaches to teaching and learning with 'strong' classification and framing and the new, more progressive approaches with 'weak' classification and framing. These tensions impact on teachers' identities and this can make effective classroom practice problematic. The article concludes that managing the tensions between traditional and more progressive pedagogies is worthwhile as this will enable students to become more fully integrated, and successful participatory members of twenty-first-century society rather than simply reproducing the socio-economic status quo, or the requirements of current dominant educational discourse in England. © 2013 British Curriculum Foundation.",Competence-based curriculum; Learning; Multidisciplinary; Teaching,,,"Beauchamp, C., Thomas, L., Understanding teacher identity: An overview of issues in the literature and implications for teacher education (2009) Cambridge Journal of Education, 39 (2), pp. 175-189; Beijaard, D., Paulien, C., Meijer, P.C., Verloop, N., Reconsidering research on teachers' professional identity (2004) Teaching and Teacher Education, 20 (2), pp. 107-128; Beijaard, D., Verloop, N., Vermunt, J.D., Teachers' perceptions of professional identity: An exploratory study from a personal knowledge perspective (2000) Teaching and Teacher Education, 16 (7), pp. 749-764; Bernstein, B., (1973) Class, Codes and Control, 2. , London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; Bernstein, B., (1990) The Structuring of Pedagogic Discourse, , London: Routledge; Bernstein, B., Official knowledge and pedagogic identities (1999) Pedagogy and The Shaping of Consciousness: Linguistic and Social Processes, pp. 246-261. , ed.

The nature of such competence-based curricula is discussed in the context of secondary schools before providing an outline of the context of each of the case study schools. A democratic and emancipatory view of education provides the rationale for the development of transferable competencies, and this is considered with respect to the challenges of engaging in a cross-disciplinary approach to the curriculum. These challenges are viewed through the lens of Bernstein's concepts of strong and weak framing and horizontal and vertical discourses. Each of the accompanying articles takes up a different aspect of education, focusing on curriculum planning, teaching and learning, and leadership and management respectively. Further challenges with regard to changes in the English curriculum are briefly reflected upon. Finally an outline of the case study methodology which was employed in the study is provided. © 2013 British Curriculum Foundation.",Case study; Competence-based curriculum; Competencies; Multidisciplinary,,,"Bassey, M., (1999) Case Study Research In Educational Settings, , Buckingham: Open University Press; Bernstein, B., (1973) Class, Codes and Control, 2. , London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; Bernstein, B., (1990) The Structuring of Pedagogic Discourse, , London: Routledge; Bernstein, B., A response (1994) Pedagogy and Knowledge: Commentaries On the Sociology of Basil Bernstein, pp. 385-424. , ed.

This article focuses on four of these schools and discusses some of the challenges they face in planning and implementing their competence-based curricula (CBC). Such curricula tend to be based on the rationale that they better prepare all students for the constant changes of human knowledge and understanding. They develop transferable skills rather than subject-specific content, which are considered necessary requirements for learners as future productive members of society in the twenty-first century. Advocates of CBC argue that such curricula are more inclusive and emancipatory than traditional curricula, although this view is contested. Employing Bernstein's concepts of framing and classification of the curriculum, this article describes the challenges and constraints encountered by four schools which have endeavoured to develop a competence-based curriculum. © 2013 British Curriculum Foundation.",Competence-based curriculum; Innovation; Planning; School transition; Secondary schools,,,"Bernstein, B., (1973) Class, Codes and Control, 2. , London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; Bernstein, B., (1990) The Structuring of Pedagogic Discourse, , London: Routledge; Bernstein, B., Vertical and horizontal discourse: An essay (1999) British Journal of Sociology of Education, 20 (2), pp. 157-173; Black, P.J., Wiliam, D., (1998) Inside the Black Box: Raising Standards Through Classroom Assessment, , London: King's College; Blenkin, G., Edwards, G., Kelly, A.V., (1992) Change and The Curriculum, , London: Paul Chapman; Crick, R., Inquiry-based learning: Reconciling the personal with the public in a democratic and archaeological pedagogy (2009) The Curriculum Journal, 20 (1), pp. 73-92; (2010) Importance of Teaching: The Schools White Paper 2010, , http://publications.education.gov.uk/, Department for Education, The; Dewey, J., Democracy and education (1916) An Introduction to The Philosophy of Education, , New York: Free Press; Feiman-Nemser, S., From preparation to practice: Designing a continuum to strengthen and sustain teaching (2001) Teachers College Record, 103 (6), pp. 1013-1055; Freire, P., (1972) Pedagogy of the Oppressed, , Harmondsworth: Penguin; Goodson, I., (1993) School Subjects and Curriculum Changes: Studies In Curriculum History, , London: The Falmer Press; Kelly, A.V., (2004) The Curriculum: Theory and Practice, , 5th ed.

Part of the strategy to deal with this economic shadow is to create a knowledge economy, but in order to achieve this, a shift to a competence-based curriculum model is seen as critical. Since the Lisbon strategy in 2000, policy documents have provided guidelines and tools for member states, but progress has been limited and in several states curriculum reforms which favoured competences have been reversed. This article uses interview data from school students from two projects in England focused on enquiry and learning competence, and analysis which draws on the theories of Bernstein, to illustrate their accounts of the difference between traditional and competence-based models. The data demonstrate the tensions caused by pupils' perceptions of the demands of summative assessment systems, which reflect a very different epistemology from experiential/competence models.

This article is a case study that examines the early stages of significant shifts in the learning and teaching process, the stepped approach that was taken and the different international influences. It was decided to focus on the top-down, policy level actions in order to trace how influences have shaped current policy on outcomes-based approaches and key competences, which are increasingly implemented in schools today. The Polish education and training system has been through a complex series of reforms, many simultaneously. The introduction of outcome-based approaches and key competences is part of much broader reforms that have affected mindsets and attitudes by having addressed the structure of the system (e.g. the length of compulsory education), school governance, the roles of principals and teachers, teacher training, etc. Parents' expectations have evolved and students are growing up in a much more connected environment with Internet and social networks and an exponential development of access to ICT and the need for digital competences and a range of key competences for lifelong learning and work (Gordon etal., 2009). Although change has taken place at all levels and in all sub-sectors of the system, this article focuses on general education in primary and secondary schools. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Curriculum; Key competences; Poland,,,"Bartnik, E., Konarzewski, K., Kowalczykowa, A., Marciniak, Z., Merta, T., (2005) Podstawa programowa ksztalcenia ogólnego.

In both cases, the meaning and use of the term have differed, sometimes giving rise to confusion. There can be no doubt, however, that this incorporation has been of significant impact. On the one hand, it has generated considerable debate between those who consider the concept to respond to economistic arguments, removed from educational realities, and those who believe it to have a transformation potential that cannot be ignored. On the other, incorporation of the concept is leading to a series of modifications in school practices and in teaching and learning with whose consequences we are not yet acquainted. This article analyses the situation created by the introduction of key competences in Spanish compulsory education and seeks to gauge the potential this offers for improving opportunities for success at school. The authors believe that key competences are a reformulation of educational intentions, whose consequences for schools and teaching practices largely depend on the new interpretation of learning in the light of different approaches and research traditions. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Basic education; Curriculum design; Curriculum development; Key competences; Spanish education system,,,"(2007), Bolívar, A. & Moya, J.

The European Reference Framework of key competences (2006) built on previous developments by the OECD, UNESCO and Member States themselves. It defined key competences as knowledge, skills and attitudes applied appropriately to contexts. Now most Member States have incorporated key competences, or similarly broad learning outcomes, into their school curriculum frameworks. This is a necessary but insufficient step towards implementation; for the effective development of learners' key competences, assessment must also change. This article focuses on the challenge of assessing cross-curricular key competences in primary and secondary education. It is based on a major study for the European Commission (Gordon, etal., 2009), which drew on information gathered and validated with the help of experts in each of the 27 EU Member States. The study's typology of assessment provides a basis for reviewing some recent developments in Member States. Present challenges and innovative responses are addressed, including 'unpacking' key competences, 'mapping' them to contexts and 'accessment' of their full scope and range. Policy developments are considered in the context of the author's work with the European Commission's Thematic Working Group on the assessment of key competences. The article concludes with considerations for policy and practice. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Assessment; Cross-curricular; Key competences; School curriculum; Transversal skills,,,"Allais, S.M., Why the South African NQF failed: lessons for countries wanting to introduce national qualifications frameworks (2007) European Journal of Education, 42, pp. 523-547; Ananiadou, K., Claro, M., (2009), 21st Century Skills and Competences for new Millennium Learners in OECD Countries (Paris, OECD); Askew, M., Hodgen, J., Hossain, S., Brestcher, N., (2010) Values and Variables: mathematics education in high-performing countries, , (London, King's College London); Bandura, A., (1995) Self-efficacy in Changing Societies, , Cambridge/New York, Cambridge University Press); Baroody, A.J., Dowker, A., (2003) The Development of Arithmetic Concepts and Skills: constructing adaptive expertise, , Mahwah, N.J., Lawrence Erlbaum Associates); Binkley, M., Erstad, O., Herman, J., Raizen, S., Ripley, M., Rumble, M., (2010), Draft White Paper 1: Defining 21st Century Skills; Black, P., Wiliam, D., (1999) Assessment for Learning: beyond the Black Box, , London, GL Assessment); (2008), Cedefop Terminology of European Education and Training Policy: a selection of 100 key terms (Luxembourg); (2001) Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: learning, teaching, assessment, , Commission of the European Communities (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press); (2009), Commission of the European Communities Key competences for a changing world: Draft 2010 joint progress report of the Council and the Commission on the implementation of the ""Education & Training 2010 work programme""; Crick, B., The presuppositions of citizenship education (1999) Journal of Philosophy of Education, 33, pp. 337-352. , doi:10.1111/1467-9752.00141]; (2006), Europa Key Competences for Lifelong Learning.

The Reference Framework of Key Competences for Lifelong Learning, a Recommendation approved by the European Parliament and the Council in 2006, and the work carried out within the Open Method of Coordination as well as by European research bodies have had a significant impact on Member States' curriculum reforms. This article shows that some terminology issues, both conceptual and practical, may explain, together with other causes, the diverse formulations of key competences and the way in which they are being integrated into the compulsory education curricula by the Member States or at intra-national levels. The focus of the article is on cross-curricular competences because these are the key competences which require the most significant innovations in teaching and learning practices, on assessment tools and procedures, and school organisation. The analysis illustrates the main differences and convergences in policy formulation and implementation strategies among the EU Member States. It also identifies key obstacles that must be overcome for an effective implementation before suggesting some policy recommendations. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Compulsory education; Cross-curricular key competences; Curriculum policy; European Union; Implementation strategy; Teacher professional development,,,"Altrichter, H., Curriculum implementation - limiting and facilitating factors (2005) Context based Learning of Science, pp. 35-62. , P.

However, what have yet to be discussed are the links and the overlaps between these two competences. Based on the development of research projects on these two fields, this article will compare the two sets of competences, both qualitatively and quantitatively. It will describe how the values and dispositions that motivate and inform active citizenship and learning to learn are related to each other, both empirically and theoretically. Both these competences are tools for empowering individuals and giving them the motivation and autonomy to control their own lives beyond the social circumstances in which they find themselves. In the case of active citizenship, the ability to be able to participate in society and voice their concerns, ensure their rights and the rights of others. In the case of learning to learn to be able to participate in work and everyday life by being empowered to learn and update the constantly changing competences required to successfully manage your life plans. When measuring both these competences then certain values relating positively towards democracy and human rights are common in their development. © 2010 The Authors.

PISA seeks to provide a basis for policy dialogue and for collaboration in defining and implementing educational goals, in innovative ways that reflect judgements about the skills that are relevant to adult life. PISA defines competence as the ability to successfully meet complex demands in varied contexts through the mobilisation of psychosocial resources, including knowledge and skills, motivation, attitudes, emotions, and other social and behavioural components. Measuring and comparing competencies across languages and cultures is a difficult challenge and is being pursued by PISA progressively. PISA focused its first three assessments on literacy skills, defined as the capacity of young adults to access, manage, integrate and evaluate information, to think imaginatively, to hypothesise and discover, and to communicate their thoughts and ideas effectively. The reasoning behind shifting the emphasis from assessing whether students can reproduce what they have learned towards whether they can extrapolate from what they have learned and apply their competencies in novel situations, derives from the nature of knowledge and skills required in modern life. For example, the tasks that can be solved through simple memorisation or with pre-set algorithms are those that are also easiest to digitise, automatise and offshore, and will thus be less relevant in a modern knowledge society. Since there is no overarching cross-national and cross-cultural agreement on what fundamental competencies 15-year-olds should possess, an international assessment such as PISA can only capture a selection of competencies. Moreover, since various methodological constraints limit the nature of competencies that are currently amenable to large scale assessment, PISA cannot capture the entirety of competencies that will make young people successful. However, the findings presented in this article suggest that the competencies that PISA does assess are highly predictive for the future success of students. In addition, PISA provides policy makers and practitioners with useful tools to improve quality, equity and efficiency in education, by revealing some common characteristics of students, schools and education systems that do well. In a modern world, comparative assessments are an essential tool for educational improvement and research shows that the existence of standardised assessments and examinations is one of the most powerful predictors for the success of an education system. That is not hard to understand, because without such assessments, all students, schools and education systems look the same, it is impossible for teachers and school administrators to detect institutional and systemic strengths and weaknesses, and to support and intervene where expectations are not met. Without reliable and comparable information on learning outcomes, teachers and governments alike rely on input-based incentives and policies that are all too often mirrored in large quality variation between schools as well as a strong dependency between learning success and the socio-economic context of students and schools. Last but not least, it is important to keep in mind that the absence of the reading, mathematical and scientific competencies measured by PISA does not automatically imply the presence of all those important competencies that have not been measured. © 2007 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.",,,,"Autor, D., Levy, F., Murnane, R.J., The skill content of recent technical change (2003) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 118, pp. 1279-1334; Knighton, T., Bussière, P., (2006) Educational Outcomes at Age 19 Associated with Reading Ability at Age 15, , Ottawa: Statistics Canada; (2000) Literacy in the Information Age, , OECD and Statistics Canada Paris: OECD, Ottawa: Statistics Canada; (2004) Learning for Tomorrow's World - First Results from PISA 2003, , OECD.

The present-day education system has failed to nurture the kind of creative people who can play leading roles in development or to produce citizens of a good character and democratic tendencies. We need to look at education from the standpoint of expanding the totality of possibilities for national development. The current educational system of Korea can be characterized as one of ""manpower-centered education."" In this system, education functions to produce the human resources needed by the nation, and there is a strong belief in the classification and selection of high-quality human capital via the school system. We can think of an educational model that is parallel to the current system of manpower classification and selection and call it ""competency-based education."" In this model, the identification of individual ability, talent, and aptitude is deemed to be the most important, and the key task of education is selfactualization through recognition and cultivation of such talents and abilities. What educational values should be pursued within a new competency-based paradigm? First, we can reduce the relative weight of subject-centered education and introduce a competency-based curriculum in order to teach key competences for life. Second, new intelligence theories must be introduced into education in order to foster the development of students' talents, aptitudes, and potentials. Third, we can make use of positive psychology, which is a newly emerging field, the core concept of which is the belief that happiness in life depends on one's ability to develop and maintain positive feelings and emotions.
