J	Tahirsylaj, A; Fazliu, F				Tahirsylaj, Armend; Fazliu, Fitore			From Content- to Competence-Based Curricula - An Educational Account of Curriculum Policy in Kosovo	EUROPEAN EDUCATION			English	Article							KEY COMPETENCES	This qualitative study examines the changes introduced in curriculum policy in Kosovo in the latest curriculum reform of 2011. Framed by curriculum and didaktik education traditions theoretically, the findings reveal that introduction of key competences and associated learning outcomes in 2011 marked the most substantial departure from the previously content-based curriculum policy in place. It is concluded that European education trends provided the macro narrative and legitimation for the 2011 competence-based curriculum reform in Kosovo.

This observation method allowed us to highlight key elements like the population, educational level, topics, etc. to focus whether this literature contributes towards implementing competence-based education. The findings of key competencebased articles confirm that competence discourse in education has become a highly rated topic of debate from 1999 to 2013. In the two last decades, there has been a gradual increase in articles based on research combined with a decline in articles of a descriptive nature. The main contributions of articles on competency-based education are significantly in line with topics related to reflection on competence discourse and education policies that should be implemented. There is still a clear need for publications which provide examples and empirical evidence aimed at developing basic competences.

Learning Professional Knowledge: Bachelor Nursing Students' Experiences in Learning and Knowledge Quality Outcomes in a Competence-Based Curriculum	VOCATIONS AND LEARNING			English	Article						Bachelor nursing students; Theory-practice gap; Competence-based curriculum; Learning experiences; Authentic contexts; Self-directed learning	SOCIAL-WORK STUDENTS; THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE; VOCATIONAL-EDUCATION; PRACTICE GAP	Since decades, nursing education struggles with a persistent gap between the theoretical knowledge offered in the study program and its application in professional practice. To bridge this gap competence-based curricula were developed with instructional designs as authentic learning contexts and self-directed learning. In this project we explored final year Bachelor Nursing (BN) students' experiences in learning in a newly developed curriculum, and their knowledge quality outcomes and the degree of agreement with knowledge requirements. An instrumental multiple case study was conducted with interviews, concept mapping and a domain knowledge list. Results show that a third of the participants had positive learning experiences and got high appraisals for their knowledge quality. Similar to the medium and low scoring participants, they developed instrumental knowledge but integrated other forms of learning into a system of meaning, which is needed to solve non-routine problems in future practice. Medium and low scoring participants did not profit from learning in authentic contexts and self-directed learning. In conclusion, developing sufficient professional knowledge in a constructivist competence-based curriculum is influenced by students' intrinsic motivation to build a strong knowledge base, by their perception of how to learn and use professional knowledge, and their expectations of the degree of supervision and guidance by the teacher. It is recommended to evaluate the extent to which the intended curriculum is being taught.	[den Hertog, Ria; Boshuizen, Henny P.

After reviewing the literature, we designed an initial questionnaire with 37 five-point Likert-type items. This was then reviewed by a panel of experts. A pilot test was conducted with 100 participants using exploratory factor analysis. This resulted in a final scale with 23 items across five factors (beliefs about the theoretical model, level of implementation of the model, difficulties in implementing the model, resources and professional development). To verify, using new data, the level of fit of the measurement model generated by the first sample, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis, and, subsequently, a confirmatory factor analysis with structural equations on a sample of 1408 respondents. Acceptable levels of internal consistency and model fit were obtained. The result is a scale which is rapidly and easily administered. It demonstrates good criterion validity in explaining teachers' beliefs about the competence-based curriculum model, and thus reveals teachers' perceptions of the impact of this curricular reform.

J	Tahirsylaj, A; Wahlstrom, N				Tahirsylaj, Armend; Wahlstrom, Ninni			Role of transnational and national education policies in realisation of critical thinking: the cases of Sweden and Kosovo	CURRICULUM JOURNAL			English	Article						Competence-based curricula; critical thinking; transnational education policies; teacher education; mother tongue; Sweden; Kosovo	CURRICULUM	Against the backdrop of the push from the European Commission and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development for competence-based curricula, this article problematises the complexity of developing twenty-first century skills, such as critical thinking, by addressing the role transnational and national policy contexts play in realising critical thinking in the national contexts of Sweden and Kosovo. The article distinguishes between policy-critical thinking and civic-critical thinking. Relying on analyses of curriculum and policy documents, it is concluded that while in the Swedish context critical thinking competence (or ability) seems to be much more implicit than explicit, in Kosovo, the national curriculum makes explicit references to thinking competences as a form of policy-critical thinking and civic competencies as a form of civic-critical thinking. Thus, students in both contexts have opportunities to develop critical thinking skills. Furthermore, Sweden emerges as a divergent case and Kosovo as a convergent case with regard to transnational policy flow research paradigms.

J	Tahirsylaj, A				Tahirsylaj, Armend			What kind of citizens? Constructing 'Young Europeans' through loud borrowing in curriculum policy-making in Kosovo	COMPARATIVE EDUCATION			English	Article						Competence-based education; civic competences; loud borrowing; curriculum policy-making; Kosovo; European Commission	EDUCATION; CONTEXTS	Kosovo introduced two major curriculum reforms over the past 20 years - in 2001 and 2011 - each aiming to bring education closer to international trends. Simultaneously, Kosovo underwent major political, social, and cultural changes after the war in 1999, and the declaration of independence in 2008. This article relies on document analysis and uses civic competences definitions in Kosovo and European Commission frameworks to compare conceptions of citizenship for democratic life along three theoretical constructs, namely personally responsible/individualist, participatory/social, and justice-oriented/political. It coins loud borrowing to describe the policy flow into Kosovo education, specifically focusing on the latest 2011 competence-based curriculum reform. The findings show that Kosovo's curriculum alignment with the European Commission key competence approach in 2011 served larger political goals and aspirations to brand Kosovars as 'Young Europeans.' In addition, personally responsible/individualist conception and participatory/social conception of citizenship are dominant in Kosovo, as well as in European Commission frameworks.

J	Huang, XD				Huang, Xiaodong			Aims for cultivating students' key competencies based on artificial intelligence education in China	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Artificial intelligence education; Students&#8217; key competencies; Artificial intelligence curriculum; Fundamental education		Cultivating students' key competencies contributes to students' adaptation to the fast developing intelligent era. Artificial intelligence education is an important way to cultivate students' key competencies. It is increasingly important to set up appropriate artificial intelligence courses at the fundamental education stage and cultivate students' key competencies via such courses. This paper describes quantitatively how AI courses cultivate students' key competencies. First, we analyze the necessity of artificial intelligence education at the fundamental education stage and the status quo of artificial intelligence education in China. Next, we elaborate the students' key competencies which is composed of knowledge competence, team competence and learning competence, and design the curriculum of artificial intelligence at the fundamental education stage. Finally, through collecting students' questionnaires, we analyze the relationship between the curriculum of artificial intelligence and the cultivation of students' key competencies. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the 7 categories of artificial intelligence courses are beneficial to the cultivation of the six key sub-competencies of students. In addition, the problems in the current artificial intelligence curriculum are identified and suggestions for improvement are put forward.

J	Hong, WP				Hong, Won-Pyo			An international study of the changing nature and role of school curricula: from transmitting content knowledge to developing students' key competencies	ASIA PACIFIC EDUCATION REVIEW			English	Article						Key competencies; Curriculum; Competency-based curriculum; South Korea; New Zealand; Australia		The primary purpose of this study is to investigate how key competencies can be incorporated into school curricula, what relevant instructional methods are needed and what institutional support is required to make school curricula based more on key competencies. For this, the study uses qualitative data from three schools (one each in South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand). The results indicate that a transformative approach, not an additive approach, is required. That is, teachers tend to restructure existing curricula to develop students' key competencies instead of considering the latter as a new teaching component. In terms of instructional methods, teachers are likely to believe that more engaging and participatory instructional methods would help their students to practice and develop diverse aspects of their competencies. Further, the principal's efforts to enhance communication and interaction with teachers is crucial to constructing local definitions of key competencies and shared visions for integrating such competencies with school curricula and instruction. The results indicate a need for redirecting the role of school curricula from transmitting content knowledge of academic subjects to developing students' key competencies.

J	Deng, L; Peng, ZM				Deng, Li; Peng, Zhengmei			Moral priority or skill priority: a comparative analysis of key competencies frameworks in China and the United States	COMPARATIVE EDUCATION			English	Article						Key competencies; 21st century skills; moral priority; skill priority; global competition		China and the US have responded to the challenges of a knowledge-based society, technological advancement, and global competition by implementing educational reforms to impart skills or competencies required of 21st century students. This study compares the rationales, content, and curricula design of both countries' key competencies frameworks and explores the possibility of reciprocal learning. Although their frameworks have certain similarities, significant differences have arisen due to cultural factors. The Chinese framework follows the Confucian tradition, emphasising moral education, political inclinations, transferring general competencies to specific-subject ones, and integrating key competencies in the national curriculum. The US framework follows the pragmatic tradition, emphasising generic skills and economic needs. Some US states have attempted to revise curriculum standards or incorporate 21st century skills by identifying their alignment with Common Core State Standards. Both frameworks have deficiencies and face challenges in implementation, and they can learn from each other.

The present study identifies the profile of adult video gamers and defines the characteristics of the games they choose to play. It also examines the way and with what type of video games adults perceive that key competences are developed. From a quantitative perspective, the questionnaire on video games and adult education (QVAD) (Alonso and Yuste, 2015) was applied to a sample of 404 subjects. The results confirmed that adult video gamer, while playing, also learns and develops key competences. Role-playing games are those most closely linked to the development of hard (technical, practical and mechanical) and soft skills (personality traits) for globalised society. In order to favour video games of interest to adults, they should be allowed to choose different levels of difficulty and promote individual decision-making, commitment and responsibility. Information and motivation regarding video games should be reoriented, especially in the case of women with secondary and higher education and older people, who choose cognitive and strategy video games out of concern for their cognitive development, when role-playing would really respond better to their needs.

Participants were 1408 Spanish Primary and Secondary School teachers (719 women and 689 men). Participants answered an ad hoc questionnaire consisting of a 23-item, five factor scale (beliefs about the theoretical model, level of implementation of the model, difficulties in implementing the model, resources, and professional development). The questionnaire was sent through an on-line application to all Spanish Primary and Secondary Schools. The results show that teachers perceive the importance of curricular change although their expectations are negative regarding its implementation in classrooms. They are committed to the application of the CBCM but there is still a great demand for training and contextual conditions need to be improved. Regarding the factors analyzed, women have a better consideration of the degree of application of teaching strategies or the uniformity in the implementation of CBCM, while men score significantly higher in available resources. Primary school teachers have a more favorable perception in most of the items than secondary school teachers. It is necessary to address all these difficulties observed by teachers if educational reforms are intended to have a real impact on the results of the educational process.

J	Alm, K; Beery, TH; Eiblmeier, D; Fahmy, T				Alm, Karin; Beery, Thomas H.; Eiblmeier, David; Fahmy, Tarek			Students' learning sustainability - implicit, explicit or non-existent: a case study approach on students' key competencies addressing the SDGs in HEI program	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						University social responsibility (USR); Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); Higher education institutions (HEIs); Work-integrated Learning (WIL)	UNIVERSITY SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; HIGHER-EDUCATION; MODEL	Purpose This study aims to understand better the student awareness and knowledge on how the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are used in higher education institutions (HEIs) to motivate students' learning on sustainability. It is essential to consider students' understanding of sustainability at the end of their studies to assess whether they feel prepared to apply sustainability in their daily work life. Design/methodology/approach The study has a quantitative case study design, and the specific method used is an online survey with masters' students using the university student platform EvaSys. The study assesses approaching how students perceive the overall education integrating sustainability into programs and curricula. Findings The results showed that work-integrated learning (WIL) projects learning and real-life experiences as part of their studies enhanced the students' understanding of sustainability. Moreover, the study showed that integrating an understanding of the SDGs in teaching offers universities a way to frame students' key competencies in ways that allow them to develop their interpersonal competencies as ambassadors for sustainability in their future work life. Practical implications This study supports the argument that WIL and real-life university experiences enhance students' key competencies critical for sustainability. Originality/value The pedagogical approach advanced in this paper addresses how WIL and real-life experiences might develop students' key competencies on sustainability. This approach indicates that working with SDGs in teaching encourages students to promote their interpersonal competencies for sustainability.

J	Di Rienzo, P				Di Rienzo, Paolo			Making Informal Adult Learning Visible. The Recognition of the Third Sector Professionals' Key Competences	EDUCATION SCIENCES			English	Article						informal learning; key competences; tacit knowledge; third sector; volunteering; learning recognition; pedagogical tutoring		The third sector represents a vast and heterogeneous universe that has a key role in society from both the social and civil points of view. It also represents an informal learning context where competence and knowledge are acquired, often in a tacit and indirect way. This research focuses on the key competences of the third sector professionals and on the pedagogical methods to make them visible and to encourage their recognition. The quantitative and qualitative data sources include: questionnaires, focus groups, and diaries. The results show that the informal learning of key competences by professionals is a primary result of their activities that should be given greater visibility. Six areas of expertise have been identified in order to classify the range of knowledge and competence. The pedagogical approach has highlighted the importance of the tutor who applies narrative tutoring methods to facilitate the recognition of competences and their enhancement for personal and professional development. The full enhancement of competences, considered as the strengthening of people's reflection and planning potential, requires policies that can be effectively applied to the national competences certification system.

This is an Erasmus+ project and involves five European countries: Portugal, France, Lithuania, Finland and Malta. The main aim of the TEDS project is to provide European teacher educators and teachers with the knowledge and tools necessary to implement an education that promotes sustainability in their practices. Within this project, one of the objectives was to understand how key competences in education for sustainability are present in the educational documents of each of the participating countries. This article refers to the analysis carried out on Portuguese educational documents. It is a qualitative study framed on the interpretive paradigm. It is an exploratory, descriptive-interpretive study aimed at identifying and describing the main characteristics related to the key competences in education for sustainability present in the official Portuguese documents that guide teaching and learning. After the analysis, validation and discussion of the results of the content analysis carried out on the corpus, these seem to indicate that the educational documents analyzed are compatible with the key competences considered in the guiding reference framework.

The course focuses on literature teaching. The final aim of the aforementioned actions was that of promoting autonomous learning and reflective skills amongst trainees, in order to help them become responsible for their own professional development. The approach followed relies on the adoption of a competence-based curriculum and the introduction of self-assessment and metacognitive techniques. The evaluation of the experience reveals a significant improvement in the capacity of trainees to manage their own learning, in their linguistic competence, and in their handling of didactic resources and material. This research is part of a project financed by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (SEJ 2007-62329).

With the deepening of education reform, China raises new requirements on the key competencies of students. Focusing on the cultivation of these competencies, this paper develops an innovative method for digital media education based on mobile Internet technology. After surveying the current learning state of students majoring in digital media, the authors proposed a blended teaching model with digital media based on mobile Internet technology. There are four parts of the model, namely, frontend analysis, online autonomous learning, offline teaching, and after-class online evaluation. The design of each part was described in details. Then, the proposed model was applied to the Poster Design course of digital media major. Comparative analysis shows that the model promotes students' learning efficiency, and their key competencies, and receives high recognition from the students. This research provides new impetus to the innovation of digital media education based on mobile Internet technology.

The study findings reveal that even though the CBC has been introduced in different SSA countries to enhance the quality of education, the science curriculum is still implemented in traditional ways. Consequently, CBC is not effectively addressing socio-economic needs as intended, at both individual and national level. The authors are concerned with how CBC is being implemented in other SSA countries that recently have adopted this kind of curriculum and how it will be implemented in other SSA countries that are planning to embrace it. In this paper, the authors suggest ways the new ideas could be introduced and reflect on how CBC can be implemented in SSA countries that share socio-economic and environmental similarities. They finally strongly recommend the establishment of special 'laboratory' schools or science education centres as well as school-based communities of practice to enhance teachers' content knowledge and nurture contemporary teaching methods for the successful implementation of the new ideas.

Using conjoint analysis to estimate employers preferences for key competencies of master level Dutch graduates entering the public health field	ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW			English	Article						demand for schooling; productivity; human capital	RESPONSE RATES; PATIENT; SKILLS; GROWTH; DESIGN; NEEDS; WORK	This paper uses an experimental design to estimate preferences of employers for key competencies during the transition from initial education to the labor market. The study is restricted to employers of entry-level academic graduates entering public health organizations in the Netherlands. Given the changing and complex demands in public health, we study the relative importance of generic and field-specific competencies during the transition from education to the public health field. A self-explicated approach and a choice-based conjoint analysis were used to elicit preferences of employers for key competencies. The results show that employers value generic competencies relatively higher than field-specific competencies for master level graduates entering the public health field. The results are relevant for the adjustment of training in public health. Universities should continue to train master level graduates in public health with high-level cognitive skills.

The case to be discussed is the implementation of generic competencies in the Faculty of Education at the Eduardo Mondlane University in Mozambique. The evaluation was carried out when the first group of Master's students of the faculty was about to finish their studies. It shows how the evaluation of a competence-based curriculum can bring university staff, their students and representatives of the world of work together The common goal is the improved training of competent professionals, taking into account the learning process of the students, their professional practices and the specific difficulties they encounter.

J	Rutherford, J				Rutherford, Justine			Key competencies in the New Zealand curriculum: development through consultation	CURRICULUM MATTERS			English	Article								The Curriculum/Marautanga Project was launched in 2003 to build on the recommendations of the Curriculum Stocktake Report (Ministry of Education, 2002) in reframing the national curriculum. A key change to the curriculum is the proposed replacement of the essential skills with key competency groups. The process of co-construction, through various forms of contribution, has led to the development of a framework of five key competency groups. This article(1) reflects upon those contributions and traces movements in thinking around the concept, construction, and inclusion of key competencies in the New Zealand Curriculum Project. Key themes of exploration include the "concept" of key competencies, the definitions it encompasses, and the theories of learning, teaching, and curriculum it implies. Questions about the place of key competencies within the New Zealand curriculum in relation to the essential learning areas and defining and naming a key competency framework relevant to New Zealand are also explored.

It draws on several exploratory studies to describe broad types of action and change which the key competencies have afforded, tracing several recursive cycles of professional learning during which understanding of the role key competencies might play in curriculum change became elaborated in deeper and more nuanced ways.				rose.hipkins@nzcer.org.nz; sally.boyd@nzcer.org.nz						Barker M., 2004, REFRAMING ESSENTIAL; Boyd S, 2006, SHIFTING FRAME EXPLO; Capra F, 2002, HIDDEN CONNECTIONS I; Cowie Bronwen, 2009, CURRICULUM IMPLEMENT; Davis B., 2006, COMPLEXITY ED INQUIR; Davis B, 2010, J EVAL CLIN PRACT, V16, P856, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2753.2010.01499.x; Fensham P.

J	Tabbron, G; Yang, J				Tabbron, G; Yang, J			The interaction between technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and economic development in advanced countries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							YOUNG-ADULTS	The economies in developed countries have been undergoing rapid transformation in the last two decades. The most important characteristics of the transformation are: the tertiarization of the economy; technological innovations and modernization; intensified competition in the world market; globalization; demographic trends and privatization. These changes have been creating new demands for more adaptable, multi-skilled and creative labour. To meet the demands, it seems necessary to reduce the gap between academic education and vocational education; to raise the general education background of vocational education; to widen the route from vocational education to higher education; to deploy competence-based curriculum development mechanisms; to strengthen the co-operation between the education authorities and employment organization as well as industries; to decentralize the delivery system and to involve employers more in the process of TVET.

J	Lleixa, T; Gonzalez-Arevalo, C; Braz-Vieira, M				Lleixa, Teresa; Gonzalez-Arevalo, Carles; Braz-Vieira, Marcelo			Integrating key competences in school physical education programmes	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL EDUCATION REVIEW			English	Article						Key competences; school physical education; programming; curriculum	CURRICULUM; AUTONOMY; POLICY	In 2006, the European Union published its recommendations on competences for lifelong learning. Since then, key competences have been integrated into the official curriculum in Spain. The objectives of the present study are: a) to describe the strategies used most frequently by physical education teachers to incorporate key competences in their programmes; and b) to identify the profiles of teachers and schools that promote the inclusion of key competences in their physical education programmes. Data were collected via a questionnaire administered to a sample of 2051 physical education teachers in primary and secondary schools in Spain. The results show that while teachers include key competences in their programmes, they do not usually do so explicitly. The competences most frequently included are: social and citizenship skills; autonomy and personal initiative; learning to learn; and knowledge of, and interaction with, the physical world. To develop these competences, lesson plans often aim to integrate knowledge, skills and attitudes, apply problem-solving approaches, and foster the transfer of learning to everyday life. The lack of interdisciplinarity emerges as a negative aspect. Factors favouring the inclusion of competences are the provision of competence-based training for teachers and the presence of a coordination system for dealing with competences in the school. The conclusion drawn is that merely including key competences in the official curriculum is not enough; reinforcement and correction of all the aspects mentioned are essential to ensure that adequate attention is paid to competences in physical education programmes.

The study group consisted of five-year students accredited by IPMA Poland. The team of experts was comprised of recruiters, project management lecturers, assessors, and information technology (IT) industry project managers. Our research shows divergences in the approach to key competence that a project manager should have. This is understandable, given the specifics of the comparison. However, the analysis that has been conducted and presented will allow the curricula to be revised. The subsequent evaluation of curricula should address the changes in the labor market. Education should provide key competences, especially as modern project management requires a full spectrum of competences and approaches. Besides experience, project management is the most frequently pursued competence that is required in terms of staff recruitment criteria. The research resulting figures may be useful for recruiters, certification institutions, and universities.

All management teams of the 30 existing secondary schools in the city of Burgos agreed to participate. An experimental pre-test, post-test design and a mixed data extraction procedure, quantitative-qualitative, were used. Two groups were generated at random: A, experimental (16 schools) and B, control (14 schools). In the first one, key competencies were implemented under the supervision of the schools' management administration along the school year (deductive), while in schools in group B the implementation process was conducted by the teachers (inductive). Quantitative data was obtained through the key Competencies Implementation Questionnaire, while discussion groups were used for qualitative data collection. Quantitative results showed that the deductive procedure had a significant positive impact in the schools' identity and administration, and in the methodological and assessment strategies used by the teachers. Qualitative results reflected three themes: improve school coordination, teacher and training innovation, and student learning. It can be concluded that direct supervision from the school administrators seems to be necessary to successfully implement key competencies.

J	Drobne, D				Drobne, Damjana			Competence based curricula in biosciences	DIDACTICA SLOVENICA-PEDAGOSKA OBZORJA			English	Article						Bologna presses; competency-based curricula; higher education; biosciences	BOLOGNA	Bologna aims to create a single and comparable European higher education area by 2010, allowing students and staff to transfer easily from one European university to another An example of the Bologna reform is presented from the Biosciences programme at the University of Ljubljana, which is one of largest universities in Slovenia. The higher education systems of Slovenia underwent major changes between 1998 and 2004. The first level programmes at the Biotechnical Faculty at University of Ljubljana, the major faculty in Slovenia offering study programmes in biosciences began in 2007/2008. The implementation of the Bologna reform in the Biosciences study, programme "in form" is almost complete. However the reform "in-substance" has not yet been completed. The study programmes that have been reformed in Slovenia remain centred on the aims and objectives, but are not competency-focused. Competencies may be defined in the curricula, but the emphasis is still on what the teacher intends to cover This article discusses competency-based curricula and learning as a key feature of the reform in the biosciences with an emphasis on the second Bologna cycle. The aim of this paper is to explain what remains to be done beyond 2010 to realize the benefits of the Bologna reform.

J	Guitert, M; Romeu, T; Baztan, P				Guitert, Montse; Romeu, Teresa; Baztan, Pablo			The digital competence framework for primary and secondary schools in Europe	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION			English	Article							KEY COMPETENCES	There has been a lot of interest to competence-based education in research and scholarship. How competence-based education has been developed and implemented varies across education systems in Europe. The European Commission defines digital competence as one of the eight key competence standards for lifelong learning. The European digital competence framework DigComp provides a comprehensive and exhaustive framework for citizens; it has the potential to be adapted to the needs of specific target groups. Nevertheless, no current research has focused on the need for developing a common framework for primary and secondary education. To address this gap we present a digital competence framework for European primary and secondary students. DigComp and a set of European frameworks are analysed in this paper. Combining categorical analysis with the collaboration of teachers and experts in the field, we define performance criteria and components that contribute to competence by five categories, providing a framework to promote the acquisition and evaluation of digital competence. This framework can be implemented in any EU country, it incorporates the most recent theoretical advances in research on information and communication technologies.

Real-world learning opportunities in sustainability: from classroom into the real world	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Experiential learning; Competences; Higher education; Problem solving; Curricula; Sustainable development	SCIENCE; EDUCATION; CHALLENGES; COMMUNITY; KNOWLEDGE	Purpose - Academic sustainability programs aim to develop key competencies in sustainability, including problem-solving skills and the ability to collaborate successfully with experts and stakeholders. These key competencies may be most fully developed in new teaching and learning situations. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the kind of, and extent to which, these key competencies can be acquired in real-world learning opportunities. Design/methodology/approach - The paper summarizes key competencies in sustainability, identifies criteria for real-world learning opportunities in sustainability programs, and draws on dominant real-world learning models including project- and problem-based learning, service learning, and internships in communities, businesses, and governments. These components are integrated into a framework to design real-world learning opportunities. Findings - A "functional and progressive" model of real-world learning opportunities seems most conducive to introduce students (as well as faculty and community partners) to collaborative research between academic researchers and practitioners. The stepwise process combined with additional principles allows building competencies such as problem solving, linking knowledge to action, and collaborative work, while applying Concepts and methods from the field of sustainability. Practical implications - The paper offers examples of real-world learning opportunities at the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University, discusses general challenges of implementation and organizational learning, and draws attention to critical success factors such as collaborative design, coordination, and integration in general introductory courses for undergraduate students. Originality/value - The paper contributes to sustainability education by clarifying how real-world learning opportunities contribute to the acquisition of key competencies in sustainability. It proposes a functional and progressive model to be integrated into the (undergraduate) curriculum and suggests strategies for its implementation.

The participants were 1,010 teachers from 110 schools. The results showed that the teachers need training on this new competency-based approach to teaching, learning and evaluation. The hypothetical prediction model confirmed the high predictiveness of pre-service teacher education and continuous professional development regarding the proper development of the main elements of competency-based learning which contribute to achieving the purposes of today's education. One of the possible recommendations that could facilitate the inclusion of the key competences in the curriculum according to their perception is teacher training geared towards pedagogical models adapted to the reality of teaching today which optimize teachers' professional performance and students' academic achievement.

HEALTH PROFESSIONS STUDENTS' INTERPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES ON A RURAL LEARNING PLATFORM	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						digital storytelling; Interprofessional Education (IPE); key competencies; student learning	EDUCATION	A Faculty of Health Sciences launched a rural collaborative learning platform to cultivate interprofessional key competencies and to improve health outcomes. The purpose of the study was to describe health sciences students' experiences of a rural collaborative learning platform. Health professions students created digital stories reflecting on their collaborative learning experiences. Purposive sampling resulted in 23 submissions. Qualitative analysis of content identified themes and categories. Three themes, namely, metaphor, critical consciousness and professional socialisation, were identified. The metaphor categories, Journey, Setting world ablaze, Water, and Puzzle, represent students' desire to use visual cues to describe their experiences. Transformation, Personal development and Empathy signified critical consciousness. Collaborative practice, Values, Reflective practice, and Key competencies relate to professional socialisation. The researchers gained understanding of students' experiences on a rural collaborative learning platform. Through digital stories, students became aware of professional interdependency, which linked their experiences to key interprofessional competencies	[Joubert, A.] Univ Free State, Sch Nursing, Bloemfontein, South Africa		Joubert, A (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Sch Nursing, Bloemfontein, South Africa.	gnvkaj@ufs.ac.za		Hagemeister, Dirk/0000-0001-9442-3204	School of Nursing at the University of the Free State; National Research Foundation; Clinical Training Grant of the Department of Education	School of Nursing at the University of the Free State; National Research Foundation; Clinical Training Grant of the Department of Education	This work was funded by the School of Nursing at the University of the Free State, the National Research Foundation and the Clinical Training Grant of the Department of Education.

J	Janssens, O; Embo, M; Valcke, M; Haerens, L				Janssens, Oona; Embo, Mieke; Valcke, Martin; Haerens, Leen			An online Delphi study to investigate the completeness of the CanMEDS Roles and the relevance, formulation, and measurability of their key competencies within eight healthcare disciplines in Flanders	BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Allied health disciplines; CanMEDS; Continuous professional development; Delphi study; Key competencies; Midwifery; Nursing; Roles	MEDICAL-EDUCATION; SCOTTISH DOCTOR; FRAMEWORK; PORTFOLIOS; CONSENSUS	Background Several competency frameworks are being developed to support competency-based education (CBE). In medical education, extensive literature exists about validated competency frameworks for example, the CanMEDS competency framework. In contrast, comparable literature is limited in nursing, midwifery, and allied health disciplines. Therefore, this study aims to investigate (1) the completeness of the CanMEDS Roles, and (2) the relevance, formulation, and measurability of the CanMEDS key competencies in nursing, midwifery, and allied health disciplines. If the competency framework is validated in different educational programs, opportunities to support CBE and interprofessional education/collaboration can be created. Methods A three-round online Delphi study was conducted with respectively 42, 37, and 35 experts rating the Roles (n = 7) and key competencies (n = 27). These experts came from non-university healthcare disciplines in Flanders (Belgium): audiology, dental hygiene, midwifery, nursing, occupational therapy, podiatry, and speech therapy. Experts answered with yes/no (Roles) or on a Likert-type scale (key competencies). Agreement percentages were analyzed quantitatively whereby consensus was attained when 70% or more of the experts scored positively. In round one, experts could also add remarks which were qualitatively analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results After round one, there was consensus about the completeness of all the Roles, the relevance of 25, the formulation of 24, and the measurability of eight key competencies. Afterwards, key competencies were clarified or modified based on experts' remarks by adding context-specific information and acknowledging the developmental aspect of key competencies. After round two, no additional key competencies were validated for the relevance criterion, two additional key competencies were validated for the formulation criterion, and 16 additional key competencies were validated for the measurability criterion. After adding enabling competencies in round three, consensus was reached about the measurability of one additional key competency resulting in the validation of the complete CanMEDS competency framework except for the measurability of two key competencies. Conclusions The CanMEDS competency framework can be seen as a grounding for competency-based healthcare education. Future research could build on the findings and focus on validating the enabling competencies in nursing, midwifery, and allied health disciplines possibly improving the measurability of key competencies.

J	Matuszewska-Kubicz, A				Matuszewska-Kubicz, Agata			Key competencies in the labour market from the perspective of higher education students	E-MENTOR			English	Article						labour market; key competencies; students' competencies; competency level; expectations of employers	EMPLOYERS EXPECTATIONS; EMPLOYABILITY SKILLS; SELF-ASSESSMENT	The subject of key competencies in the labour market has been discussed in many publications and reports in recent years, presenting the point of view of researchers and employers on the issue. However, the perspective of future employees also seems to be worth discussing; hence this research covers university students currently entering the labour market. Ten competencies identified as key in the labour market are examined: problem-solving, creativity and innovation, analytical and critical thinking, active learning and teaching, interdisciplinarity, emotional intelligence, social intelligence, intercultural competencies, virtual cooperation, digital competency. The study aimed to determine the respondents' opinions and beliefs about selected key competencies on the labour market, their willingness to develop them, and their declared level of these competencies. The survey was carried out using the quantitative method, using the CAWI technique, on a sample of 352 respondents - students of the University of Lodz. The results indicate that the students mostly share the view that the competencies indicated as being key will be expected by employers in the labour market in the next five years. Moreover, for most of the competencies being studied, they assess their current level to be high and see the need to develop them for professional purposes. Discrepancies are also indicated between the students' self-assessment of their competencies and their employers' assessment.

J	Coral, J; Lleixa, T; Ventura, C				Coral, Josep; Lleixa, Teresa; Ventura, Carles			Foreign language competence and content and language integrated learning in multilingual schools in Catalonia: an ex post facto study analysing the results of state key competences testing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BILINGUAL EDUCATION AND BILINGUALISM			English	Article						Foreign language competence; CLIL; key competences testing; physical education; multilingualism	CLIL	The member states of the European Union have funded many initiatives supporting the teaching and learning of foreign languages. Content and language integrated learning is one of the experimental language programmes that have been introduced in Catalonia, in the north-east of Spain. The aims of this study are to analyse the results achieved by students on the state test of English language competence during the period 2009-2012 at (1) 1175 Catalan primary schools, (2) a purposive subset of 85 primary schools and (3) a school of reference (SoR), which applies a programme integrating physical education and language. The analysis indicates that the improvement of English competence occurs regardless of whether schools have participated in the experimental English language programmes. It is also showed that slightly better results can be observed in schools that apply the content and language integrated approach and a notable improvement in the SoR.

J	Reid, A				Reid, Alan			Key competencies: a new way forward or more of the same?	CURRICULUM MATTERS			English	Article								This article explores and critiques the different ways in which the concept of "key competencies" has been understood and represented in the curriculum. It is argued that if competencies are to go beyond simply reinforcing the curriculum status quo, the role they play in the curriculum needs to be better understood. The article develops one approach to understanding competencies that will, it is argued, enhance their transformative potential.

J	Lewis, L				Lewis, Lyn			Social sciences and the key competencies: A practitioner reflects	CURRICULUM MATTERS			English	Article								This article explores the way in which a teacher educator worked with a group of undergraduate student teachers to use social sciences as a vehicle for developing three key competencies. While the study is primarily practitioner focused, it does include student perspectives of the learning process. The argument is made that preservice student teachers, who will be expected to teach through key competencies in the classroom, should be experiencing learning through key competencies in their teacher-education programme. Not only will they understand the process of teaching through the competencies, but their learning experiences will serve as useful future reference points when similar expectations are made of their students.

If society is to achieve this, some key paradigm changes must occur in education. The school must first prepare a competence-based curriculum and, secondly, school practice should move away from subject-based teaching, towards an interdisciplinary STEM teaching approach. Obviously, to support this, modern learning environments and ICT solutions and tools have to be used. However, since the interdisciplinary STEM approach has already been implemented and integrated, it can be said that a new, integrated science discipline (STEM) has already emerged, together with a trans-disciplinary approach to STEM learning and teaching. In the present research, a concrete case of designing, developing and producing a solar chimney was used to demonstrate an integrated approach to learning and teaching, while emphasizing especially the advantages of such an interdisciplinary (transdisciplinary) approach to teaching Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematic content. The empirical research shows that such an approach produces incomparably better results, especially on higher cognitive levels, in comparison to traditional approaches to learning and teaching.

J	Seo, E; Ryu, J; Hwang, S				Seo, Eunjung; Ryu, Jaemyong; Hwang, Seyoung			Building key competencies into an environmental education curriculum using a modified Delphi approach in South Korea	ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH			English	Article						Environmental education curriculum; secondary school; key competencies; modified Delphi; national curriculum	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; FRAMEWORK; ESD	This study adopted the modified Delphi method to build key competence indicators for the course subject 'Environment' in the secondary school curriculum in South Korea. 15 Delphi panelists participated, and were provided a three-stage questionnaire survey. The findings classified eight secondary school 'environment' curriculum key competencies into three domains: intellect-oriented, personality-oriented, and relationship-oriented. The intellect-oriented domain includes 'critical-thinking ability,' 'creativity,' and 'problem-solving ability'; the personality-oriented domain includes 'autonomy,' 'ability to reflect,' and 'environmental sensitivity'; and the relationship-oriented domain includes 'communication ability' and 'ability to manage conflicts.' These environmental competencies were utilized to revise the current environmental education curriculum as part of the 2015 revision of the National Curriculum and set the key competencies for environment classes. The paper concludes with the significance of developments in theorizing and implementing environmental education curriculums in Korea and abroad.

Relational scanning model was used in the study. The sample of the study consists of 594 teacher candidates enrolled in the pedagogical formation course of the Faculty of Education of Firat University. In order to collect data, the "Lifelong Learning Key Competences Scale" developed by Sahin, Akbasli and Yanpar-Yelken (2010) and "Competences Scale for Educational Technology Standards" developed by coklar (2008) were used. Diagnostic analysis, t-test, MWU and Pearson Correlation analysis were benefited from for data analysis. According to the analyzes, it was determined that teacher candidates participated in lifelong learning key competencies in upper intermediate level in dimensions other than "communication in foreign language competence" sub-dimension. Significant results were found in favor of female candidates in terms of the "competence of communication in the mother tongue", "competency to learn learning", "competency of social citizenship awareness" and according to the gender variable across the scale. It is determined that teacher candidates have high level of educational technology standards self-efficacy. A significant difference in favor of female candidates was observed according to the gender variable "technological processes and concepts knowledge", and according to gender" learning environments and planning and designing of learning experiences" sub-dimensions. It was figured out that teacher candidates had moderate level positive relationships between the key competences of lifelong learning and the educational technology standards self-efficacy sub-dimensions. In the light of the results of the research, it has been recommended some suggestions.

J	Noguera-Mendez, P; Cifuentes-Faura, J				Noguera-Mendez, Pedro; Cifuentes-Faura, Javier			Environmental sustainability in economics teaching: analysing Spanish upper secondary economics textbooks	ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						Sustainability; economics education; ethics; education for sustainable development; action competence; textbooks	KEY COMPETENCES; EDUCATION	The study of economics involves core issues of sustainable development very relevant to society, such as growth, consumption or wellbeing. Accordingly, its epistemology and teaching contents influence other disciplines, the conception of society and the political agenda. From this perspective, it is strategic that the teaching of economics promotes sustainable development. The aim of this article is to examine what the subjects of economics and business economics teach about sustainability at the upper secondary education level in Spain, and if they contribute to the acquisition of the key competencies of the education for sustainable development. A content analysis is carried out of both the curriculum and the textbooks to that end. Our results emphasise that the ideas, concepts and values transmitted by the Spanish upper secondary economics textbooks do not adequately promote knowledge about sustainability or the learning of the key competencies.

However, there is a lack of empirical instruments aimed at assessing preservice teachers' opinion of competency-based policies, their self-evaluation regarding such policies, and their understanding of the intended rationale behind competency mandates. Instruments with similar aims in other contexts suffer psychometric shortcomings. Therefore, the authors' aim was to design an instrument to examine primary preservice teachers' beliefs about the role of key competencies in education, self-evaluate their understanding of the concept of key competencies, and determine if they understood the intended interdisciplinary focus. A three-phase pilot (n = 295, n = 277, n = 263) was carried out with each phase aimed at progressively improving the instrument's psychometric soundness. Drawing from data obtained from the third pilot, the psychometric scale properties are reported for a much-needed assessment tool.

One of the greatest challenges in this transition is the difficulty in changing the knowledge-oriented practices of teachers. This study evaluates the consistency between syllabus design and the requirements imposed by a competence-based learning environment. To make this comparison, the study sets four criteria (C1: explicit relationship between syllabus and graduate profile; C2: precision of the learning outcomes and assessment criteria; C3: contents that mobilise the learning outcomes; and C4: learning and assessment activities) derived from the literature and a thematic analysis of competence-based learning in higher education. Afterwards, a sample of 150 syllabi from different disciplines of five Chilean public universities were analysed, all of which stated the use of learning outcomes and competences in their learning models. Using a three-point Likert scale derived from the aforementioned criteria and their indicators, a comparison was made between the actual practices reflected in the syllabus design and the previously established criteria. Results show a gap between the declaration of a competency-based curriculum and actual syllabus outlines. Moreover, there are important differences among disciplines. Although all disciplines present high levels of accomplishment for Criteria 1 and 3, only the discipline of health sciences presents an acceptable level for Criteria 2 and 4. It is recommended that further research be undertaken towards identifying effective competency-based syllabus design.

The article develops a definition of Dialogic Literacy based on a cross-disciplinary approach combining deliberative discourse, collaborative rationality, and Moral Foundation Theory. Furthermore, it presents a framework that educators can utilize in order to transform classroom discussion into activity that fosters learners' Dialogic Literacy. Finally, the article argues for elevating the status of Dialogic Literacy as an overarching learning goal that should become an integral part of language education.

J	Kruszewska, A				Kruszewska, Aleksandra			Teachers' understanding of the role of key competences in working with children: a study of the perceptions of early years educators in Southern Poland	EDUCATION 3-13			English	Article						Profession of a teacher; awareness of the role of a teacher; types of competences; key competencies; early school education		The nature of education has changed significantly in Poland recent years based on the rapidly changing reality of political, social and professional life and greater emphasis has been placed on a communicative model of teaching which has required the development of new sets of skills or competences by teachers. In this study research on the competences of early school education teachers was carried out in primary schools in the southern part of Poland in the area of Silesian Voivodship. A diagnostic survey was applied as a way of collecting information about the state of social awareness, opinions and views of the community of teachers. The research used a survey questionnaire (self-assessment) directed to a representative sample of 121 active early years teachers. The study analysed the respondents' answers to four questions about the factors, activities, nature and role of competences in the work of a leading teacher, who is a form teacher of children in classes I-III. The results show the importance of early years teachers placed on different sets professional competences especially in relation to the preparation of the best materials for curriculum delivery, pupil motivation, and classroom organisation.

J	Kouwenhoven, W; Howie, S; Plomp, T				Kouwenhoven, W; Howie, S; Plomp, T			The role of needs assessments in developing competence-based education in Mozambican higher education	PERSPECTIVES IN EDUCATION			English	Article								Valid and reliable assessment of learning depends, amongst other things, on the precise definition of the outcomes and the expected results, as well as on the comprehensive description of performance criteria. In a competence-based approach assessment implies certifying the 'proof of competence' by the student. Competence is seen here in a holistic sense, as the totality of (core) competencies required to perform as a competent professional. Competencies signify the link between professional practice and personal intentions and are either innate or acquired and developed during an educational intervention. Therefore, the formulation of competencies is an essential step in creating a competence-based learning environment. Competencies can be defined after an analysis of the profession. This article describes a needs assessment aimed at characterising a profession in the form of key occupational tasks or roles and translating this professional profile into a graduate profile, including the core competencies that are the focus of the educational intervention. The design and development of a competence-based curriculum at the newly founded Faculty of Education at the Eduardo Mondlane University (UEM) in Maputo, Mozambique, will be used as an example.

J	Taylor, M; Bailey, J				Taylor, Merilyn; Bailey, Judy			Mathematics and The New Zealand Curriculum in the primary classroom	CURRICULUM MATTERS			English	Article							EDUCATION	The aim of this article is to comment on the ways in which beliefs and theories of learning affect the teaching and learning of mathematics. When mathematics is viewed as a static body of knowledge, a transmission style of teaching is often employed. In contrast, a radical constructivist view of learning suggests that mathematics could be a constructive and creative endeavour. We suggest that this perspective of mathematics aligns with the principles, values and key competencies in The New Zealand Curriculum (Ministry of Education, 2007).

J	Zhu, C; Wang, D				Zhu, Chang; Wang, Di			Key competencies and characteristics for innovative teaching among secondary school teachers: a mixed-methods research	ASIA PACIFIC EDUCATION REVIEW			English	Article						Teacher perceptions; Characteristics; Competencies; Innovative teaching; Secondary teachers	HIGHER-EDUCATION; PERSPECTIVES; TECHNOLOGY; BELIEFS; CONTEXT; ROLES	This research aims to understand the key competencies and characteristics for innovative teaching as perceived by Chinese secondary teachers. A mixed-methods research was used to investigate secondary teachers' views. First, a qualitative study was conducted with interviews of teachers to understand the perceived key competencies and characteristics for innovative teaching among Chinese secondary teachers. Seventeen characteristics were identified underlying four key competencies that were perceived critical for innovative teaching. Secondly, an instrument was developed in order to validate the identified key competencies and characteristics and to measure teachers' perceived importance of the key competencies and characteristics for innovative teaching. A total of 325 secondary teachers participated in the survey. The results show that the four-factor model of key competencies for innovative teaching was validated and the importance level of the perceived characteristics was also identified. This research has theoretical and practical significance with regard to the development of competence-based teacher education programs.

J	Caena, F; Vuorikari, R				Caena, Francesca; Vuorikari, Riina			Teacher learning and innovative professional development through the lens of the Personal, Social and Learning to Learn European key competence	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TEACHER EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						teacher professional development; teacher learning; personal; social and learning to learn key competence	CHARACTER; CONTEXT	This article outlines a secondary analysis of two European studies on innovative teacher professional development, through the lens of the Personal, Social and Learning to Learn European key competence. The 2018 European Recommendation describes it as being resilient, reflecting upon oneself, working with others, and managing time, information, learning and career. Adaptive, socio-emotional and metacognitive competences can be essential to harness other competences and navigate an unpredictable world, as argued in the LifeComp European framework. To nurture this key competence, teachers have to develop it themselves throughout the career. Innovative professional development can be a catalyst, addressing the complex and situated nature of teacher learning. It entails re-thinking time, space and mode of delivery, embedding active learning, relevance to practice, collaboration, coaching, feedback, and reflection. Innovative examples are presented as reciprocally related to Personal, Social and Learning to Learn, for resilient education systems in the wake of the COVID 19 pandemic.

J	Falloon, G				Falloon, Garry			Learning objects and the development of students' key competencies: A New Zealand school experience	AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								This paper outlines a study investigating the impact of the use of learning objects on the development of two key competencies from the revised New Zealand Curriculum Framework (Ministry of Education, 2007). It specifically focuses on the key competencies of 'thinking' and 'relating to others', and explores how teachers in an urban intermediate school (year 7 and 8) planned and integrated learning objects into a wider 'community' social studies topic, and the impact this integration had on student competency development. Outcomes from the study indicate that learning objects can, for some students, provide a motivating and engaging learning experience through which thinking capabilities and relationship skills can be enhanced, but that such development is dependent upon several factors including the design, content, and level of interactivity of the objects, how closely they align with learning goals, the careful selection of student groupings, and how access to the learning objects is organised and managed. The study also revealed some issues with the use of new digital data collection tools, particularly related to the accuracy of coding of visual information, and how to best translate this into text format for publication without 'diluting' its richness and meaning.

The lack of scientific research and discussions show that little investigation has been done on the issue of development of key competences. Therefore, the primary objective of our study is to present the teaching methodology, the process of creating the educational model and the pilot verification aimed at the development of key competences through interactive whiteboard in the subject of Technology. The partial results of the pilot research conducted on the research sample of 6th and 8th grade students of primary schools on Slovakia show its usefulness especially in the development of teamwork, in terms of interpersonal competences, problem solving in terms of learning competences and reading comprehension in terms of communication competences. The presented educational model reflects the contemporary requirements in terms of using information and communication technologies in the teaching of the subject of Technology, in which the acquisition of key competences becomes considerably important.

It is considered in the context of the concept of the knowledge-based society. The authors consider the nature of the relation between personal and professional competences and how they contribute to effective teaching as well as participation in professional learning communities. The main assumption is that personal competences pre-empt professional ones and enable teachers to fulfill the roles which are perceived in the different dimensions.

J	Simonovic, N				Simonovic, Nikola			Teachers' Key Competencies for Innovative Teaching	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE RESEARCH IN SCIENCE ENGINEERING AND EDUCATION-IJCRSEE			English	Article						teacher competencies; innovations in teaching; reflective practice	PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE; EDUCATION; IMPLEMENTATION; MATHEMATICS; LEADERSHIP; STANDARDS; SCIENCE	The educational process is by its nature and essence very dialectical, so it necessarily requires teachers to have a developed whole set of various competencies. The aim of the research was to examine teachers on self-assessment of competencies that were crucial for innovating the teaching process. The sample of respondents included 1300 elementary and secondary school teachers in the territory of Southern Serbia. The instrument used was a five-point TCS scale of attitudes, with a total of 48 items (individual competencies). The results of the analysis showed that teachers, based on their self-assessments, highly value all diverse groups of competencies, which fully confirms the general hypothesis. The results also showed the existence of statistically significant differences in the degree of expression of attitudes about competency groups with regard to independent research variables, within special hypotheses, based on which the first was rejected, the second partially and the third and fourth special hypothesis fully confirmed. The issue of key competencies of teachers is certainly one of the fundamental issues when it comes to quality teaching, its innovation, generally successful and efficient dealing with the educational process. Based on these postulates, there is hope that the obtained research results will represent a good starting point and incentive for further research work in this field in the future.

J	Bibila, S				Bibila, Stavroula			The peculiarities and challenges of integrating generic forms of knowledge into the upper-secondary curriculum: A Bernsteinian analysis of 'Communication' and 'Application of Number' in the Welsh Baccalaureate	CURRICULUM JOURNAL			English	Article						Bernstein; functional skills; key competences; literacy; numeracy; Welsh baccalaureate	EDUCATION; PERFORMANCE	Throughout the past 40 years, a number of terms have been used in the UK to refer to competency-based pedagogies that focus on preparing students for everyday 'life' and employment. The evolution of these generic forms of knowledge in official curricula has been accompanied by harsh practical realities when it comes to teaching, assessing and certifying them. These practical realities counterbalance the strong support genericskillism enjoys in policy discourses that centre on employability and universalism in upper-secondary education. By drawing upon Bernstein's sociological insights and data collected and analysed as part of a study that sought to examine the compulsory integration of Communication and Application of Number into the Welsh Baccalaureate Advanced Diploma (legacy qualification), this paper offers new empirical observations into the persistent peculiarities and challenges of teaching and assessing generic forms of pedagogised knowledge. The discussion takes into consideration practical and policy dimensions that extend beyond individual education sites in Wales and are also relevant to the 2017 review of the new Essential Skills Wales qualifications, ongoing developments following the 2018 review of the Welsh Baccalaureate Skills Challenge Certificate, and the Council of the EU 2018 Recommendation of Key Competences for Lifelong Learning.

A Delphi study to construct a CanMEDS competence based inventory applicable for workplace assessment	BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Portfolio; Medical education; Content validity; CanMEDS roles; CanMEDS competences; Workplace assessment; Delphi study; Competence inventory	MEDICAL-EDUCATION; PORTFOLIO ASSESSMENT; PERFORMANCE; CRITERIA	Background: During workplace based learning students develop professional competences and an appropriate performance. To gain insight in the learning process and to evaluate competences and performance, assessment tools are essential and need to be of good quality. We aimed to construct a competence inventory applicable as an instrument to measure the content validity of workplace based assessment tools, such as portfolio. Methods: A Delphi study was carried out based on the CanMEDS Roles Framework. In three rounds, experts (N = 25-30) were invited to score the key competences per CanMEDS role on relevance (6-point Likert-scale), and to comment on the content and formulation bearing in mind its use in workplace based assessment. A descriptive analysis of relevances and comments was performed. Results: Although all competences were scored as relevant, many comments pointed at a lack of concrete, transparent and applicable descriptions of the key competences for the purpose of assessment. Therefore, the CanMEDS roles were reformulated in this Delphi procedure as concrete learning outcomes, observable and suitable for workplace based assessment. Conclusions: A competence based inventory, ready for validating workplace based assessment tools, was constructed using a Delphi procedure and based on a clarification and concretisation of the CanMEDS roles.

J	Murga-Menoyo, MA				Murga-Menoyo, Maria Angeles			EDUCATION IN THE ANTHROPOCENE. POSSIBILISM VERSUS UTOPIA	TEORIA DE LA EDUCACION			English	Article						education for sustainability; critical awareness of the species; sustainability competencies; existential competencies; planetary citizenship; Anthropocene	KEY COMPETENCES; FRAMEWORK	This paper is a reflection on education within the framework of the Anthropocene, accepting as key educational challenges the problems which justify assigning this name to the current geological epoch. The urgent need to train citizens, who are actively committed to the principles and values of sustainability, derives from these problems. The local point of this issue has two main aspects: the first lotuses on transformative action as a nurturing dynamic of the training process; the second considers the competencies that education should aim to promote. On the one hand the paper reviews the updated typology of competencies which, described as 'transformative', are included in the Learning Compass 2030 (OECD, 2019). This adds complexity to the training proposal of the DeSeCo model (OECD, 2005). On the other hand, there is an analysis of the significant aspects of the typology of key competencies for sustainability, as promoted by UNESCO (2014; 2018a). From a reflective consideration of both typologies, the lack of elements (capacities) necessary to reach a critical awareness of species - whose training significantly affects what each individual can become - is evident. The so-called 'existential competencies' of Edgar Morin (2016), which point to the most radical core of the human being, are then proposed as complementary to strengthen the consistency of the model. These competencies are not explicitly included in the, otherwise laudable, initiatives which international organisations and institutions are deploying in order to bring the Education 2030 agenda to fruition. However, it is necessary to focus attention on them within the framework of a truly transformative quality education. Therefore, incorporating them into the competency model dominant on an international level is imperative in order to radically address the gravity, and urgency, of current socio-ecological problems. Anthropological substrate, provided by a biocentric humanism, is required to carry this out. This is a substrate committed to the moral responsibility which requires preserving the dignity of life in its extraordinary diversity.

Through sustainability competences, the necessary changes in people's behavior in the pursuit of a sustainable society can be intensified. In this study, Finns (n = 2006) express their knowledge of climate change and biodiversity loss and evaluate their own anticipatory competence. The connection between their environmental awareness and the future's orientation toward a society of sustainable actions will be studied by statistical analysis. The study discusses how learning sustainability competences can be promoted in science education and reveals the gap between females and males in their objectives for a sustainable future. Finns with higher education have greater environmental awareness than those with lower education. The connection between Finns' environmental awareness and their structural skills for making a more sustainable future is quite clear.

The following two questions were addressed: Q1. What kind of sustainability competences do participants acquire in the Master Class? Q2. What is the role of PBL in the learning outcomes? Design/methodology/approach The study is based on an ex ante open-ended survey and post-ante interviews addressed to the participants. The data were analysed using the qualitative content analysis. Findings The findings show that the Master Class contributed to most of the competences under study. However, unlike in previous studies, systemic thinking is highlighted as a fundamental rather than a parallel core competence. Furthermore, the results also emphasise the role of emotions, which is insufficiently acknowledged and accounted for in sustainability education. Research limitations/implications - The study focussed only on the learning outcomes of the participants (students) and not the other parties (such as company and researchers). Practical implications - Future research should focus on affective dimension as a stepping stone to the transformational learning. In addition, the role of the systemic understanding in sustainability education should be highlighted as a core competence. Social implications - The study revealed the overall positive impacts of the co-creation in university business collaboration to the participants' sustainability competences. Originality/value The study presents an empirical case study where the various competence frameworks were applied with a result of confirming the validity of the existing key competences, in particular the systemic understanding and showing the role of the affective dimension in the transactional learning.

J	Campos, DM				Munoz Campos, Diego			Problem-Based Learning: An Experiential Strategy for English Language Teacher Education in Chile	PROFILE-ISSUES IN TEACHERS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						English teacher education; learning strategies; problem-based learning		The Chilean education system requires English language teachers to be equipped with non-conventional teaching strategies that can foster meaningful learning and assure successful learners' performances in diverse and complex settings. This exploratory, descriptive, research study aimed at discovering the perceptions of 54 pre-service teachers about the impact of a problem-based learning activity in the development of key competencies, including higher order thinking skills and reflective, research, knowledge transfer/integration, social, and self-management skills. Groups of participants chose a madeup, ill-structured problem which combined language teaching and socio-cultural issues, and devised holistic solutions. Findings suggest a comprehensive impact on the first four skills, but a limited impact on social and self-management skills.

J	Chudy, S				Chudy, Stefan			Development and Creation Determinants of Decision-making Competences in the Preparation of Social (Services) Pedagogues at TBU in Zlin	NEW EDUCATIONAL REVIEW			English	Article						social pedagogy; competence; research; decision-making; practice		The paper is oriented to professional and personality preparation of social pedagogues at TBU In our paper, we will endeavour to elaborate a functional model of competences, which will be verified in practice and subsequent reflection on the professional preparation of social pedagogues at TBU in Zlin. We shall base upon the knowledge and observations contained in the current professional literature as well as working practices (i.e. praxis). Decision-making competences - on which our attention and activities are focused in this paper, are highly specific competences. The decision-making competence is not understood (by us) from the perspective of technical, economic, or social policies, but rather from the perspective of key competences - which are the load-bearing competences, and at the same time, include within themselves a dimension of other competences and these individual competences intermingle to various degrees as does their content.

At the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University, a structured medical didactic qualification programme prepares and trains future tutors for their responsibilities. This programme consists of four modules: 1. medical didactics and group leadership, 2. subject-specific training, 3. performance of tutorial courses as well as 4. collegial advice and reflection on the tutors' activities. The aim of this study is to systematically analyse and present the development of role competencies for medical tutors based on the CanMEDS Physician Competency Framework through the didactic qualification programme.MethodsWe applied a qualitative research approach to detect CanMEDS role competencies acquisition within the tutor qualification programme. The CanMEDS framework describes key competencies, grouped thematically under seven professional roles. Two tutors and three training coordinators independently assigned the individual modules of the tutor qualification programme to the key competencies of the CanMEDS framework. Tutors and training coordinators compared and discussed the allocations within the groups in a consensus finding process. All authors analysed the findings in order to find out the so-called hidden curriculum. The views of both groups are presented separately.ResultsThe training programme promotes the acquisition of competencies in all seven CanMEDS roles. The roles of the scholarand the leaderare promoted in all modules. In addition, the first and fourth module focus predominately on the role of the collaborator, the second on the role of the medical expert and communicator, and the fourth on the role of the professional.ConclusionsThe systematic analysis through assignment of the CanMEDS roles to the individual modules of the tutor qualification programme documents the comprehensive acquisition of competencies, not only with regard to the tutor activity, but generally with regard to the later role of the physician. The reflection on one's own competency acquisition can support the promotion of corresponding competencies in the qualification programme and their transfer into the professional practice later.

By examining the content validity (n = 35 experts), comprehension (n = 173 students) and construct (n = 523 students) of the instrument, the results showed correct psychometric quality, internal consistency, reliability and adequacy of the structural model: X-2/df = 2.08, TLI = 0.88, CFI = 0.90, GFI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.04, and SRMR = 0.04. The final version of the Questionnaire on Perceived Competency-based Learning of primary school students (#ICOMpri1) includes eight dimensions and 27 items. The results showed a high perceived competency-based learning of primary school students. This is therefore a valid and reliable instrument that provides a more subjective and real vision of primary students' academic performance. Nevertheless, future studies should analyse the criterion-related validity by comparing perception results with those of international academic achievement.

To do so, bilingual (n = 1,966) and non-bilingual students (n=14,713) of Castilla-La Mancha enrolled in the 2nd year of Compulsory Secondary Education took a series of tests designed to assess two dimensions of the competence of learning to learn: "metacognitive strategies", made up of two learning standards related to metacognitive processes, and "learning strategies", a dimension consisting of five standards connected to cognitive processes. Results showed bilingualism had a significant effect on the acquisition of the key competence of learning to learn.

The first approach is field-based learning through Field Schools carried out in Vietnam, Laos and Thailand. The second approach is a structured role-playing web-based simulation exercise (e-Sim) on Mekong Basin environmental management challenges. This paper discusses the complementarities of these approaches and considers the degree to which these two experiential approaches to teaching and learning have contributed to key competences, namely cross-cultural communication and understanding, multi-disciplinary approaches to environment and development, and regional knowledge of Southeast Asia.

A quantitative approach to working with information and a frontal style of teaching, still a wide practice in many institutions, no longer seem to be suitable preparation for current students' needs. One of the areas affected by these changes are the foreign language competences necessary to efficiently deal with study and job related practices and, correspondingly, to succeed in the job market. Along with the change in student needs comes the demand for change in the organization of language classrooms and instruction. Young people, facing a deluge of information and unlimited access to resources, are challenged by the changing needs in processing the material. A qualitative approach to information is required with a growing focus on information processing, analysis, critical evaluation and implementation in practice. Similarly, the need for efficient communication skills such as negotiation, argumentation or presenting seem to be more in demand than grammatical precision or encyclopedic knowledge. From this perspective, language instruction accentuating activities focused on memorizing and drills needs to be restructured so the students can develop targeted key competences for the current times. This paper focuses on the research of student needs and how they are perceived from the perspective of students and their study or internship experience, as well as from the perspective of teacher practitioners. The purpose of the study is to identify the key competences students need to succeed in the job market as a resource for restructuring university language instruction.

A sample of 129 university students of the academic year 2017-18 was used. A pre-experimental study was carried out, using a pre-test-post-test study with natural groups, without a control group. The findings of this study show that service-learning contributed to improve knowledge in sustainability in the 5 case studies analysed. The findings also demonstrate how the use of service-learning promotes the development of practical skills associated with sustainability action.

Pushing the boundaries: experience-based learning in early phases of graduate sustainability curricula	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Sustainability; Education for sustainable development; Experiential learning; Experience-based learning; Higher learning; Key competencies in sustainability	HIGHER-EDUCATION; COMPETENCES; LEADERSHIP; FRAMEWORK	Purpose This paper aims to investigate student experiences and the potential impact of experience-based learning (EBL) in the early phase of graduate sustainability programs through the lens of key competencies. The goal is to provide evidence for the improvement of existing and the thorough design of new EBL formats in sustainability programs. Design/methodology/approach This comparative case study focuses on the first semester of three graduate sustainability programs at Leuphana University of Luneburg, Germany and Arizona State University, USA, for two of which EBL was a core feature. The study compares the curricula, the teaching and learning environments and the reported experiences of one student cohort from each of three programs and synthesizes the resulting insights. Student interviews were combined with student self-assessments and supported by in-vivo observations, curriculum designer input, instructor interviews and course materials. MAXQDA was used for data analysis following a grounded theory approach. Findings EBL influences students' reflective capacity, which impacts the development of key competencies in sustainability. Qualitative analysis found four key themes in relation to the students' learning in EBL settings, namely, discomfort, time-attention relationship, student expectations of instructors and exchange. The intersection of these themes with curricular structure, student dispositions and differing instructor approaches shows how curriculum can either support or interrupt the reflective cycle and thus, holistic learning. Research limitations/implications With the focus on the first semester only, the students' competence development over the course of the entire program cannot be demonstrated. Learning processes within EBL settings are complex and include aspects outside the control of instructors and curriculum designers. This study addresses only a select number of factors influencing students' learning in EBL settings. Practical implications Early engagement with EBL activities can push students to leave their comfort zones and question previous assumptions. Designing curricula to include EBL while encouraging strong intra-cohort connections and creating space for reflection seems to be an effective approach to enable the development of key competencies in sustainability. Originality/value This paper investigates the experiences of students in EBL through a key competence lens. The study combines student self-perceptions, instructor reflections and in-vivo observations. Data collection and analysis were conducted by a researcher not affiliated with the programs. These factors make for a unique study design and with data-driven insights on the seldom researched competence-pedagogy-curriculum connection.

Fostering the Key Competencies of Undergraduates Majoring in Primary School Teaching and Learning based on the Standards of PISA International Comparative Study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						higher education; pre-service teachers majoring in primary school teaching and learning; key competencies; PISA-based test		The purpose of the study was to identify how the reshaped curriculum that was based on PISA standards fostered the key competencies of undergraduates majoring in primary school teaching and learning in terms of materials design and teaching methodology used throughout the internships at schools. The study used qualitative and quantitative methods with qualitative methods getting higher priority to enlarge the base of evidence and get a deeper insight into the issues under research. It was found that reshaping the preservice teacher professional training, specifically in test format, materials design, and assessment, and made the shift to training schoolchildren to take PISA-based test was necessary for the school educational settings in Ukraine. The teacher students' awareness of the PISA-based test needed improvement. The training model used in the study along with the internship addressed the loopholes in the university curriculums and training of the students majoring in primary education. The intervention brought a positively challenging experience for the students. It helped them to 'pump up' their intellectual, professional, and technical skills. They raised awareness of the PISA-based test, Blooms' Taxonomy, and test question formulation. The students learned to use DIF and DTF methods to validate the PISA test questions, age specifics in training primary school children in terms of adjusting it taking the PISA-based test, and approaches to creating a positive mindset in primary schoolchildren towards learning through dialogue and cooperation. It was found that the students upgraded their teaching and material design skills and became more confident as teachers in terms of PISA-based test training. Changing the students' perceptions and their teaching approaches were the major difficulties and challenges to the study. They were addressed through mentorship which was used when the students did internships.	[Mukoviz, O. P.; Kravchuk, O., V; Roienko, L. M.; Torchynska, T. A.; Voloshina, H.

Imagining globally competent learners: experts and education policy-making beyond the nation-state	COMPARATIVE EDUCATION			English	Article						Global competence; OECD; PISA; social imaginaries; key competencies; epistemic communities; education policy-making	CONSTRUCTION	This paper examines competency-based educational policy-making in a global context. Specifically, it explores how the thinking around competency, spearheaded by international organisations and experts, has led to the development and deployment of a particular notion of global competency. Drawing on critical policy research, I examine three international policy events in which experts convened to discuss, debate, and co-construct ideas related to competencies in education. I argue that by structuring the assessment of knowledge and fixing meanings, the OECD, along with networks of experts, has created and diffused a particular social imaginary of a globally competent learner. Given the complexity and uncertainty of the world today, increasing the global and intercultural knowledge and awareness of the world's students is vitally important. Yet, with so much at stake, researchers must critically examine the processes through which educational futures are being imagined while at the same time, pursuing more equitable and inclusive education policy-making within and beyond the nation-state.

J	Lochner, J				Lochner, Johanna			Educators' intentions for learning in Virtual School Garden Exchanges: a comparison with the aims of Education for Sustainable Development	ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH			English	Article						School gardens; virtual exchanges; ducation for Sustainable Development; learning outcomes; educators&#8217; perspectives	KEY COMPETENCES	It is widely recognized that education plays a key role in addressing current global challenges. Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) combines local actions with global thinking. In Virtual School Garden Exchanges (VSGEs) primary and secondary students from the Global South and North interact and communicate digitally about their school gardens. This study focuses on educators' expectations regarding learning outcomes of VSGEs and possible parallels with ESD and Virtual Exchanges (VEs) in general. A qualitative content analysis of 23 semi-structured interviews with educators engaged in 18 VSGEs was conducted. Even though the VSGEs took different individual approaches, the analysis revealed many commonalities in the respondents' intentions: amongst other things, educators were aiming to promote knowledge about gardening and food, horticultural and cooperation competencies, and values such as solidarity. Nevertheless, some educators feared that VSGEs might also have some negative effects. The results show parallels with the aims of ESD and VEs.

At present, these competencies have acquired a social and educational relevance that makes them essential tools to face equality of opportunities and social inclusion, while constituting a specific ecological environment for the development of interculturality from school contexts (Hernandez and Iglesias, 2017). Starting from this reflection, this work aims to develop a map of digital resources on interculturality that serves as a support tool in the teaching-learning process of intercultural competence. It also seeks to value information and knowledge as resources against discrimination, racism, prejudice and stereotypes of various kinds. To this end, relevant sources of information will be identified and selected, a classification according to their characteristics and purpose will be proposed, and their main benefits will be described. The existence or not of specialized resources in the subject matter of study will make it possible to verify the relevance given to interculturality in a globalized society.

While project-based learning formats claim to advance such skills, there is little empirical evidence that demonstrates how interpersonal competence is being developed. This study aims to describe and explains teaching and learning processes of project-based sustainability courses that contribute to the development of interpersonal competence as one of the key competencies in sustainability. Design/methodology/approach This study on an international project-based learning course adopted a multi-method case study approach, triangulating observations, semi-structured interviews and focus groups supported by Photovoice method through which students tracked their learning processes. Data collection and analysis followed a grounded theory approach. Findings Learning through and from conflicts within a learning community can foster competence development in teamwork, communication and stakeholder engagement. This study identified inner and outer conflicts (within individuals versus between individuals or groups) as potential drivers of learning processes, depending on strategies applied to address these conflicts. Originality value The value of this study is fourfold: it demonstrates how conflicts can be leveraged for students' competence development; it provides in-depth empirical data from multiple perspectives, it discusses the findings in the context of teaching and learning theories, and it demonstrates an application of the Photovoice method to track and improve teaching and learning processes.

The application of the formative assessment at this stage is presented as a way for them to acquire these competencies. This research assesses graduates' perception of the development of key teaching competencies and whether there are significant differences depending on whether or not they are working as teachers. The relationship between some elements of assessment and grading and the development of competencies is also studied. Four hundred and eighty-seven graduates from seventeen Spanish universities participated. The results show that (a) there are no differences in the perception of the competencies acquired depending on whether or not graduates are working; (b) graduates who are working as teachers positively relate the assessment items to two of the three sets of competencies studied, and participative forms of grading to the competencies of development, application and assessment of teaching and learning processes in physical education; and (c) those who are working believe that using formative assessment during their pre-service training has helped them put the teaching competencies into practice in their professional work.

J	Jauregi, K; Melchor-Couto, S				Jauregi, Kristi; Melchor-Couto, Sabela			The role of coaching in teacher competence development for telecollaboration	ALSIC-APPRENTISSAGE DES LANGUES ET SYSTEMS D INFORMATION ET DE COMMUNICATION			English	Article						telecollaboration; competencies; tutoring	COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION; PROMOTING LEARNER AUTONOMY; INTERCULTURAL COMPETENCE; VIDEO-COMMUNICATION; LANGUAGE USE; ONLINE; ENVIRONMENTS; PERCEPTIONS; EXCHANGES	The use of telecollaboration (TC) is gradually increasing across the different stages of education. However, TC is still seen as an add-on in the language classroom for various reasons: difficulty in changing the pedagogical mindset in mainstream education to engage in innovative explorations, inadequate training, lack of support, additional time and effort that these activities require or constraints imposed by the curriculum. In addition, teachers must master a number of very diverse competences in order for TC to be successful. The present contribution explores the role of the "coach" in TC, in an attempt to determine whether his/her assistance can help teachers develop some of those key competences. A total of 23 secondary school teachers participated in this case study as part of the EU-funded project TILA. Data were collected via two surveys, the first one on coaching and the second one on teacher competences. The results show that teachers highly value coaching when it comes to introducing complex pedagogical innovations in their teaching. Participants also reported an improvement in key competences necessary to implement TC exchanges successfully throughout the coaching process.

J	Hu, WP; Guo, XP				Hu, Weiping; Guo, Xipei			Toward the Development of Key Competencies: A Conceptual Framework for the STEM Curriculum Design and a Case Study	FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION			English	Article						STEM education 1; curriculum 2; systems framework 3; key competencies 4; think-based instruction theory 5	INFORMATION LITERACY; LEARNING PROGRESSION; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; ISSUES; INSTRUCTION; CREATIVITY; MOTIVATION; AUTONOMY; PROGRAM	National attention has been given to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, which is well recognized as an effective way to cultivate the key competencies of 21st-century talents. However, current STEM education falls short of the desired results. The fundamental reason is that there has not been a clearly and structurally explained systematic construction and effective implementation of STEM curricula. Accordingly, this article systematically expounds on the construction of the STEM curricula system from four aspects. Specifically, we first proposed the components of the STEM competencies as the goal of STEM education to provide a guiding direction for other parts of the design of the STEM curricula. Then, we elaborated on how to cultivate the STEM competencies from two aspects: the design principles of the STEM curricula content and the implementation strategies of STEM teaching. Finally, we explained how to effectively evaluate to monitor and improve the implementation of the STEM curriculum. In addition to the above mentioned, we then presented a case study of STEM courses constructed under the guidance of "think-based instruction theory" (TBIT) to help readers further understand the nature of the STEM curricula.

J	Harlow, A; Cowie, B; Heazlewood, M				Harlow, Ann; Cowie, Bronwen; Heazlewood, Megan			Keeping in touch with learning: the use of an interactive whiteboard in the junior school	TECHNOLOGY PEDAGOGY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						interactive whiteboard; junior school; key competencies; New Zealand		Recent literature on the role of the interactive whiteboard (IWB) has indicated numerous ways in which teachers make use of the IWB to support children's learning. In these studies there is a growing awareness of changing roles in the classroom as teachers gain confidence in the use of new technologies. This study describes how a researcher worked with a teacher in a small rural school in New Zealand to document and understand the use of an IWB to enhance the learning of young children ages five to six years. The focus of the research was on how the features of the IWB supported teaching actions and provided potential and structure for the children to develop their 'key competencies', broadly conceptualised as the development of knowledge, skills and aptitudes for learning. Here the authors demonstrate that it was the teacher's orchestration of the classroom environment, incorporating the use of the IWB, that was the key to the development of pupil autonomy as they learnt to take risks and to be creative in their learning with the interactive whiteboard.

Hence, mastering the chefs' key competencies through culinary schools is very important. Many studies have examined chef competencies, but we have not yet discovered how to measure the chefs' key competencies according to culinary student perceptions. This study involved 392 culinary students in public vocational high schools. Data was collected by proportional random sampling through a questionnaire distributed to seven public vocational schools in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Questionnaire validation used three techniques, namely, content validity test with Aiken V analysis, small sample validity test with Pearson correlation analysis, and finally, CFA analysis. This study shows that culinary students' perceptions of chefs' key competencies can be explained by indicators of creativity, culinary skills, hygiene & food safety, aesthetics, business sense, interpersonal, managerial, and leadership. Chefs' Key Competencies Questionnaire (CKCQ) consists of 30 items consisting of creative (3 items), culinary skills (5 items), hygiene & food safety (4 items), aesthetics (2 items), business sense (4 items), interpersonal (3 items), managerial (4 items), and leadership (5 items). All items (30 items) have good validity and reliability values. The findings of this study discuss in-depth and some implications for vocational education practitioners proposed for further improvement. VET practitioners can also use this questionnaire to evaluate the achievement of the chefs' key competencies of culinary students and professional chefs.

J	Mursak, J				Mursak, Janko			GENERAL EDUCATION IN THE FUNCTION OF LABOUR MARKET NEEDS AND/OR PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE NOTION OF LITERACY	ODGOJNE ZNANOSTI-EDUCATIONAL SCIENCES			English	Article						general education; lifelong learning; literacy key competencies; national literacy strategy		The notion of literacy has broadened in the last decades and now incorporates a whole range of different and new key competencies. The consequence is a change in the goals and subject matter of literacy programmes, language and literature teaching, and general education as a whole. This article presents the dilemma about the role of general education in modern society or more precisely, asks whether we are facing a situation where learning and education as a basic human right have given way to learning and education as a means of economic and social development.

J	Takayama, K				Takayama, Keita			OECD, 'Key competencies' and the new challenges of educational inequality	JOURNAL OF CURRICULUM STUDIES			English	Article						OECD; PISA; key competencies; educational inequality; Japanese education	PISA	In this paper, I develop a critique of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)-based lifelong learning policy discourse with a particular focus on key competencies' (KCs) and its equity implications for school curricular policies. First, I review the discussion of KCs in the writings by the OECD-affiliated researchers and other OECD documents. In so doing, I identify a marked decoupling of KCs from the initial lifelong learning policy framework. Then, I situate the discussion of KCs within the sociological critique of the new mode of learning deemed essential for a knowledge society'. I identify KCs' potential to naturalize the (re)production of inequalities through schooling and argue that this can be further compounded by the extraction of KCs from the lifelong learning policy discourse. Finally, I ground these expositions in the specific policy context of Japanese education, highlighting how KCs and its decoupled articulation pose a difficult policy dilemma for Japan's Ministry of Education attempting to address the widening class-based inequalities through schooling. Hence, this study critiques the contemporary school curriculum reform driven by KCs by tracing the flow of this concept from the international policy discourse down to the level of a national policy development. In conclusion, I call for curriculum studies to recognize the increasingly globalized curricular policy context and develop strategies for the new challenges of educational inequalities that confront us today.

After testing the validity of Twitter as a technological curriculum innovation process, we can conclude that it promotes a substantial improvement of the teaching-learning process, specifically in the development of reading and writing skills. Twitter application on mobile digital devices, such as smartphones, tablets, or mini laptops becomes a digital resource with numerous possibilities in education.

J	Schaeper, H				Schaeper, Hildegard			Development of competencies and teaching-learning arrangements in higher education: findings from Germany	STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article							SELF-REPORTS	The Bologna Process places special emphasis on the outcomes of higher education in terms of employability and key competencies. Taking Germany as an example, this article examines whether the introduction of a two-tier degree structure actually has led to an enhanced acquisition of key competencies. Based on constructivist learning theories, in addition, the article tests the hypothesis that an activating learning environment enhances the acquisition of both disciplinary and key competencies. Data are used from a survey among higher education graduates from 2005. The results of linear regression analyses suggest that the new bachelor programmes provide better conditions for developing key competencies, and also indicate what the ingredients of a competence-oriented teaching approach might be.

The application of analysis procedures for the assessment of music competences is proposed based on the data collected in an exam administered at the end of the course. The sample of the study consists of 1327 students (n = 1327) in the first year of Compulsory Secondary Education in Spain and measures the level of acquisition of the key competences denominated "cultural and artistic". The results are subjected to the K-means classification technique. This technique is used to obtain homogeneously distributed conglomerates which allow for an objective evaluation of the levels of acquisition of the key musical competences.

Dynamically changing world demands a new approach to the graduates training consisting of the key competences formation, the main of which the ability to study during the whole life. Reading becomes the main activity to form the ability to study during the whole life. Reading is a functional, basic ability for education and for the life in the modern society. Decrease in the reading led to considerable decrease in reader's literacy of the population, as a result to shortage of knowledge, information that prevents the national development of the country and its integration into global world economy and policy. The investigation of the problem showed that it is of international character as in the course of the rapid development of information and communication technologies a noticeable decrease of a ratio of regularly reading part of modern society is noted.

Predictors of digital competence in 7th grade: a multilevel analysis	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING			English	Article						culture for professional development; digital competence; family background; mastery orientation; self-efficacy	INTERNET SKILLS; SELF-EFFICACY; ICT; INFORMATION; LITERACY; DIVIDE; GENDER; ONLINE	Since 2006, the ability to use information and communication technology (ICT) has been included as a key competence in the curriculum in Norway, and specific competence aims are developed for most grades. The aim of this study was to identify students' ability to use ICT according to the competence aims, and to examine factors that can predict students' digital competence. A sample of 1793 students and 125 school leaders from 125 schools was used. The findings show variation in digital competence both between students and between schools. Results from a multilevel analysis showed that higher levels of mastery orientation and self-efficacy (i.e., motivation) and the students' family background (i.e., language integration and the number of books at home) were predictors of students' levels of digital competence. Additionally, when school leaders reported higher levels of culture for professional development among the teachers at school, increased levels of digital competence were found among students. Challenges for schools and teachers to support students' motivation and to emphasize digital inclusion still prevail.	[Hatlevik, O.

J	Merono, L; Calderon, A; Arias-Estero, JL; Mendez-Gimenez, A				Merono, Lourdes; Calderon, Antonio; Arias-Estero, Jose-Luis; Mendez-Gimenez, Antonio			Primary school student and teacher perceptions of competency-based learning	CULTURA Y EDUCACION			English	Article						key competences; structural equation model; pedagogical models; teaching-learning process; academic achievement	KEY COMPETENCES; PARENTAL SOCIALIZATION; ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; PHYSICAL-EDUCATION; DIGITAL NATIVES; YOUNG-CHILDREN; MATHEMATICS; ADOLESCENTS; SKILLS; SPORT	In the search for an educational system that enables students to achieve the best academic results, it is extremely important to explore the perception of the main educational agents: students and teachers. Therefore, the objectives of this paper were: (a) to analyse primary school student and teacher perceptions of students' competency-based learning; (b) to assess the possible differences between them; and (c) to test hypothetical models for predicting learning according to their perception. The participants were 8,513 students from 58 schools and 1,010 teachers from 110 schools. Overall, both teachers and students reported high scores of perception. However, the perception of the students was higher than that of the teachers, except for the digital competence. While the results showed differences in perception between both prediction models of competency-based learning, both groups perceived the competences of autonomy and personal initiative, digital competence, social competence and citizenship, and lifelong learning as core elements of their perception. In this regard, initial and ongoing teacher training in innovative pedagogical models is needed to enable the development of these competences, which are predictors of perceived learning.

Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 professors in the Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability at OU and 10 professors in the School of Sustainability at ASU. Findings -The results highlight the complexity of teaching sustainability in an interdisciplinary manner in both programs. Professors are incorporating many of the key competencies of sustainability teaching, but in a patchwork manner that does not necessary follow the comprehensive frameworks from the literature. Practical implications -The comparative analysis leads to recommendations for teaching sustainability in higher education.

J	Gordon, J; O'Toole, L				Gordon, Jean; O'Toole, Linda			Learning for well-being: creativity and inner diversity	CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF EDUCATION			English	Article						education; creativity; core capacities; children; well-being; learning; diversity; competence	TIME	This article explores the perspective that well-being and creativity can be nurtured in children through understanding and addressing the diverse ways in which children learn, communicate, and develop (inner diversity). In particular, our working hypothesis is that focusing children's and young people's learning towards the realization of their well-being supports and enables creativity. But it also requires, firstly, addressing how children perceive, engage with, and express creativity in different ways and, secondly, nurturing the development of core capacities to, in turn, underpin their capacity to develop key competences and skills in formal and non-formal learning settings. In recommending that education systems take the well-being of children as their central purpose, we are suggesting that there are capacities, ranging from personal qualities to behavioural skills, which are necessary for the development of the personal resources to enable lifelong and life-wide learning.

J	McChesney, J; Cowie, B				McChesney, Jane; Cowie, Bronwen			Communicating, thinking, and tools: Exploring two of the key competencies	CURRICULUM MATTERS			English	Article								Of all the key competencies, thinking and using language, symbols, and texts are the most closely connected to the learning areas of The New Zealand Curriculum (Ministry of Education, 2007). In this paper we explore these competencies from different perspectives, with a focus on three of the learning areas: Mathematics and Statistics, Science, and Technology. We explore the competency of thinking within the context of disciplinary knowledge, and discuss using language, symbols, and texts from a "cultural tools" perspective. We end by bringing these two competencies together as we attempt to address issues relating to what counts as knowledge and knowing in these disciplines.

J	Platts, EJ; Kerner, B; Adams, N; Archer, JM				Platts, Ellen J.; Kerner, Bridget; Adams, Nick; Archer, Jan-Michael			FEW and Far Between Rebalancing Research and Training Priorities at the Food-Energy-Water Nexus	SCIENCE & EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access							HIGHER-EDUCATION; KEY COMPETENCES; SUSTAINABILITY; STAKEHOLDERS; PERSPECTIVE; GOVERNANCE; SECURITY; POLITICS; JUSTICE; TEXAS	The food-energy-water (FEW) nexus framework calls for a systems perspective on addressing complex sustainability challenges. As a sustainability science field, nexus research should in theory bring together transdisciplinary approaches drawing from a range of stakeholder knowledge and experiences. This approach would align with the competence-based training for future sustainability leaders advocated for in sustainability education literature. In practice, the field is dominated by techno-scientific approaches with superficial or peripheral attention paid to issues of social justice and community engagement. In this article, we explore how this imbalance in the literature reflects a breakdown between the ideals of sustainability training and the reality of training at the nexus and describe obstacles that may be contributing to this breakdown, including a prejudice towards the idea of "objective" science, institutional incentives, and disciplinary culture. To address these concerns, we introduce a research project focused on assessing the training of future researchers at the FEW nexus and exploring how these programs train students in particular views of what is important at the FEW nexus, such as technological solutions, stakeholder collaboration, and/or issues of equity and justice.

J	Madondo, F				Madondo, Fortunate			Perceptions on Curriculum Implementation: A Case for Rural Zimbabwean Early Childhood Development Teachers as Agents of Change	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CHILDHOOD EDUCATION			English	Article						Competency-based curriculum; curriculum implementation; early childhood development; early childhood education and care; teacher agency	REFORM	This article examined perceptions on curriculum implementation regarding rural Zimbabwean early childhood development (ECD) teachers in 2017. The study aimed to locate teachers as agents of change in schools by reviewing their perceptions in implementing the recently introduced ECD framework. In this qualitative multiple case study, 30 rural teachers from Zimbabwe's 10 provinces shared their views as well as strengths and weaknesses of the competence-based curriculum. Implicit in the teachers' descriptions of effective curriculum implementation were their perspectives on effective classroom instruction. Such perspectives offer much insight into challenges experienced in curriculum implementation for rural schools. Using teacher agency as a theoretical framework, findings of the study revealed that teachers lack support regarding proper infrastructural facilities, and schools lack human, financial, and material resources for successful curriculum implementation. The researcher recommends that as a basis for future policy, the concerns of teachers, parents, and learners in complex ECD settings need to be highly prioritized by the curriculum makers ahead of planning and implementing a new curriculum.

J	Gallagher, C; Hipkins, R; Zohar, A				Gallagher, Carmel; Hipkins, Rosemary; Zohar, Anat			Positioning thinking within national curriculum and assessment systems: Perspectives from Israel, New Zealand and Northern Ireland	THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Thinking (ICOT)	JUN 20-24, 2011	Belfast, NORTH IRELAND			Teaching thinking; International comparison; Curriculum implementation; Curriculum policy; Assessment policy	KEY COMPETENCES; SKILLS	Over the past decade there has been a major move to position 'thinking' (however thinking is defined and enacted) as a more explicit outcome within the curriculum of many nations, with implications for teachers' professional development, assessment, and examination requirements. This paper analyses approaches to this challenge taken by Israel, New Zealand and Northern Ireland. Each short case study considers: the political context in which the developments emerged; the ways in which thinking has been framed within the national curriculum, assessment and examination system; and the successes and challenges of the approaches taken to embedding change. Comparing and contrasting three different national systems provides important insights into the priorities, commitments and resources allocated to supporting a focus on thinking as a valued curriculum goal and outcome. In particular, it highlights the need for greater coherence between curriculum, professional development, pedagogy and assessment policies generally. Given the increasing international emphasis on the importance of developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills as a response to 21st century learning challenges, the paper reflects on what more may need to be done to leverage and sustain change.

An expert panel that included representatives from seven units providing university-based initial teacher education in Finland carried out this process. To produce an active construction of a shared understanding and an interpretation of the discourse in the field, the experts reviewed literature on teaching. The resulting teacher competence model, the multidimensional adapted process model of teaching (MAP), represents a collective conception of the relevant empirical literature and prevailing discourses on teaching. The MAP is based on Blomeke et al.'s, Zeitschrift fur Psychologie, 223, 3-13, (2015) model which distinguishes among teacher competences (referring to effective performance of teachers' work), competencies (knowledge, skills, and other individual competencies underlying and enabling effective teaching), and situation-specific skills of perceiving, interpreting, and making decisions in situations involving teaching and learning. The implications of the MAP for teacher education and student selection for initial teacher education are discussed.

J	Barker, M				Barker, Miles			The New Zealand Curriculum and preservice teacher education: Public document, private perceptions	CURRICULUM MATTERS			English	Article								The development of The New Zealand Curriculum from 2000 to 2007, including the initial review that gave rise to the curriculum stocktake, the development of the draft curriculum, and the production of the final curriculum, are reviewed and analysed from the standpoint of preservice teacher education. Particular attention is paid to the way the initial goal of creating a less-crowded curriculum was augmented as certain elements (vision, principles, key competencies, future-focused themes, values) came to assume increasing prominence in a process of "complexification". Twenty challenging questions for teacher education in the future (its purposes, structure, culture, and ways of operating) emerge, and are reviewed in the context of New Zealand's Graduating Teacher Standards.

The patient care space was unavailable as a learning environment, which compounded the complexity of preparing students for clerkships with a traditional transition to clerkship (TTC) curriculum. We developed a multimodal, structured approach to re-introduce students to the clinical space prior to the start of clerkships. 105 second year medical students completed a 4-week clinical enhancement course. A modified Delphi method was used to select core topics, which were then anchored to key Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs). Students participated in 9 virtual problem-based cases, workshops and multiple supervised patient encounters. Students were surveyed before, during, and after the course; responses were compared with paired t-tests. 25.9% rated the course as excellent, 44.2% as very good, and 19.5% as good. Compared to baseline, self-perceived efficacy grew significantly (P < 0.05) across all EPAs. Improvements in key competencies were sustained when students were surveyed 2 weeks into their first clerkship. This was a well-received, novel course, focused on helping students transition back into the clinical space through a multimodal teaching approach. This framework may be used by other institutions seeking to restructure their TTC initiatives.

J	Smidt, J				Smidt, Jon			Finding Voices in a Changing World: Standard Language Education as a Site for Developing Critical Literacies	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						standard language education; literacy; key competencies; basic skills; critical literacy		What are the "key competencies" needed in our time? What literacy is needed to make students active participants in their societies and contributors to changing cultures? This article offers a contribution to the ongoing discussion about these questions. It takes as its point of departure the "key competencies" formulated in the OECD program Definition and Selection of Competencies (DeSeCo) in response to educational challenges in a changing world, and the five "basic skills" to be developed in all school subjects from year 1 to year 13 in the Norwegian curriculum of 2006 (LK06). It argues, first, for the need to understand "basic skills" in the perspective of DeSeCo "key competencies", with a focus, as formulated in DeSeCo, on using tools interactively, acting autonomously, and interacting in heterogeneous groups. Secondly, the aims and purposes of the school subject "Norwegian" in Norway, as formulated in LK06, are discussed in relation to the aims of the DeSeCo key competencies and the concepts of critical literacy and Bildung. Thirdly, the article offers a discussion of how standard language education can become a site for the development of key competencies and critical literacies, drawing on Mikhail Bakhtin's ideas about utterances and voices and Roz Ivanic's about discoursal identities, and talking about the StLE subject as a potential public space, a stage, a resonance room, and a cultural workshop. Finally, some concluding remarks are made about the crucial role of the teacher in such a curriculum, and about the role of standard language education in relation to other school subjects.

Adriaan			Perceived effects of competency-based training on the acquisition of professional skills	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Competency-based training; Implementation; Training; Assessment; Skills	VOCATIONAL-EDUCATION; SUSTAINABILITY; QUALITY; GROWTH	The need to develop key competencies to meet the changing demands of industry has made the introduction of competency-based training (CBT) reforms in the Vocational Education and Training (VET) system a priority in many countries. This article explores the views of polytechnic students in Ghana on the effect of CBT on the acquisition of competencies to perform professional tasks. The results show that the modular structure has indirect effects on the acquisition of skills through quality teaching and feedback. It is argued that assessment in CBT needs to move away from emphasising more on routine tasks towards the development of broad sets of generic skills and adaptable workforce. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Clark, PG				Clark, Phillip G.			Potentials and pitfalls of networking in interdisciplinary education: Taking on the challenges in gerontology and geriatrics	GERONTOLOGY & GERIATRICS EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						Interdisciplinary; interprofessional; networking; education; competencies		Gerontology and geriatrics are quintessentially interdisciplinary fields. To understand aging, an interdisciplinary perspective is necessary; to provide quality care to older adults with complex, chronic conditions, an interprofessional team is required. Academic, clinical, and community-based settings - with their vertical organizational structures - need bridging strategies to create networks that support interdisciplinary education in both classroom and experiential settings. Taking on these challenges requires emphasizing the importance of key competencies that integrate the unique perspectives, contributions, and roles of different disciplines, and creating the connections critical for promoting interdisciplinary education. First, this paper develops a theoretical foundation for networking to construct and maintain educational and service provider partnerships. Second, the organizational and institutional requirements for successful networking are explored, based on both empirical research and principles from the theoretical framework. Finally, practical recommendations for the development of key strategies for implementing and sustaining interdisciplinary and academic-clinical-community partnerships are summarized.

The Sustainability Literacy Test is an open online training and assessment tool developed as an international collaborative initiative, in the context of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and the Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME). This paper discusses how the tool works and emphasizes two major contributions: firstly, drawing a snapshot in the measurement of Sustainability Literacy worldwide at the present time, and secondly, providing an open tool to raise awareness on sustainability. The Sulitest enables higher education institutions (HEI's) to assess that they are producing sustainability literate graduates and to engage multiple stakeholders in accelerating the integration of sustainability in higher education standards and beyond.

In Poland the issues of disability and disabled people have been present in the public debate for many years. However, the changes in the social as well as economic climate of life justify taking actions and their adjustment to reality, so as not to marginalise the issues of disability in terms of the state's responsibilities for its citizens. One of such actions is the professional insertion and employment of people with disabilities. The paper will tackle the above-mentioned problems.

Learning to learn in the European Reference Framework for lifelong learning	OXFORD REVIEW OF EDUCATION			English	Article						key competences; learning to learn; self-regulated learning; lifelong learning	EDUCATION	This article explores the construction of learning to learn that is implicit in the document Key Competences for Lifelong LearningEuropean Reference Framework and related education policy from the European Commission. The authors argue that the hallmark of learning to learn is the development of a fluid sociality rather than the promotion of fluent task-oriented behaviour. They also make the case for greater attention to the embodied, situated, affective and creative dimensions of learning to learn. These are considered in the context of the main trends in EU lifelong learning policy over the last two decades, which indicate a narrow instrumentalist approach to learning situated firmly within the human capital paradigm. The authors focus on the internal coherence of the Framework, and on the tensions inherent in learning outcomes' that emphasise personal fulfilment and wellbeing, social cohesion and economic competitiveness respectively. This article is the first step in clarifying the epistemological basis of learning to learn, and wresting it from narrow identification with self-regulated learning and meta-cognition, and ultimately challenging a narrow reading of human capital theory.

However, the social, technological, and economic changes that have occurred in the 21st century have made critical thinking, creativity, communication, and collaboration, key competences to face the challenges of a rapidly changing world. In this study, we developed a Computational Thinking (CT) curriculum based on student-centred pedagogical strategies to enhance these four competences. This curriculum was designed under the socio-cultural vision of learning, in which individuals interact in communities to build significant knowledge. An embedded mixed-method approach was implemented to evaluate improvements in competence development both in quantitative and qualitative ways in a sample of 42 students. The results indicate an encouraging increase in skills related to the competences of interest thanks to the implementation of a student-centred pedagogical curriculum based on CT. Additionally, by designing the curriculum under socio-cultural ideas of education the results show that the students and the teacher were able to form a community to facilitate teaching and learning.

J	Charteris, J				Charteris, Jennifer			Agentic subjectivities and key competencies	CURRICULUM MATTERS			English	Article								Curriculum commentators have identified well-documented participatory pathways for key competency development. However, there is a paucity of New Zealand research that takes a poststructural view of how competencies play out in classroom discourses. It is the contention of this article that, rather than learners 'having' agency to transfer competencies from one situation to the next, competencies can be produced and enacted as learners shift subjectivities across discourses. The findings are particularly relevant to New Zealand schooling contexts that seek to embed key competencies into day-today classroom practices. Located in a Year 9 English classroom of a regional high school, this analysis furnishes an example of learner agency in action when a student navigates classroom discourses to take up a position as both a novice writer and a leader.

The question arises, can the school system develop the kind of functional literacy in students, which allows them to fulfil, in real life, their personal and professional needs related to the competence of reading and creating written texts from the field of science, technology and engineering? The present research aimed to explore how students in today's schools are trained in functional literacy, especially in the fields of technology and engineering, and what kind of literacies in the field of STEM they are able to (or should be able to) master competently. The present research showed that students achieve relatively poor results in the area of functional literacy, both regarding their science literacy, and especially their technology and engineering literacy, which is a result of a lack of competence on behalf of mother-tongue teachers to develop this kind of functional literacy.

These countries have been chosen owing to their effective methodical systems. Both original sources and receptive experience of Ukrainian researchers have been taken into account. Therefore, the article aims to select innovative methodical tools that are not widely used in Ukraine. Importantly, the article adheres to a transformational and innovative approach to objectification and prediction of educational changes, as well as to comparative, summarizing and other theoretical methods. Consequently, it has become possible to identify innovative features of professional training for future physical education teachers in the above-mentioned countries and outline potential changes in Ukrainian education after borrowing relevant experience and implementing it within the traditional lecture-seminar system. Furthermore, the article addresses the problem of methodological diversity, as well as the prevalence of axiological approaches over those closely related to physical education and its methods. The international relevance of the article lies in summarizing innovative approaches used in different countries to forms and methods of professional training of future physical education teachers. It will allow one to comprehensively or selectively borrow this experience to improve education in the countries dealing with transformational changes.

To realize the challenge educators have to face huge difficulties as a tendency to flatter the world and its inhabitants dominates and becomes more and more powerful. A musical fairy tale is presented as a valuable and effective school practice. From one side it refers to perennial human custom of listening, telling, and creating stories, fables, and sagas. They may base on real life or refer to imaginary situations. Thus creation may have various realizations, depending on personal knowledge, skills, life experience, cognitive horizon, individual interests and virtues. From the other side the idea of the fairy tale shown in the paper refers to the music and its uncountable possibilities of describing the world. Everything depends only on one's imagination. The last part of the paper presents the effects of students' work on musical fairy tales. Those students apart of being instrumentalists and vocalists of the Music Academy of Lodz, Poland plan to become music teachers in compulsory general education.

J	Cepic, R; Pejic Papak, P				Cepic, Renata; Pejic Papak, Petra			Challenges of Curriculum Planning and Achieving Learning Outcomes: A Case Study of Croatian Elementary School Teachers' Experiences	REVISTA ROMANEASCA PENTRU EDUCATIE MULTIDIMENSIONALA			English	Article						Learning outcomes; competence-based curriculum; pupil-centered learning; teachers' professional development; qualitative case study		This paper aims to explore the experiences of first, fifth, and seventh grade teachers (N = 23) in competence-oriented teaching from one elementary school included in the implementation of an experimental curriculum reform program in the Republic of Croatia. Based on the qualitative case study approach, the analysis of teacher evaluation protocols considered teachers' opinions in the context of achieving learning outcomes with the use of teaching activities and methods. The paper also analyzes teachers' opinions about the required changes in the planning and implementation of the teaching process as well as their professional development. For the learning success to increase, it is important for teachers to emphasize with their competences the organization of pupil-centered activities in achieving learning outcomes that change the approach to the planning of teaching. The focus of contemporary teaching should be on problem solving, active involvement of pupils in the teaching process while respecting the pupils' interests, experiences, needs, motivations, prior knowledge, and expression of creative abilities. The teaching process focuses on constructivist teaching and the conceptual approach using collaborative methods and forms of work, technology in teaching, formative evaluation, and innovative approaches, whose intensity and complexity varies in different circumstances. The results indicate that teachers recognize the potential of a contemporary competence-based approach and pupil-centered learning and teaching by achieving learning outcomes. Emphasis is placed on collaborative methods and forms of work, the introduction of digital technology and autonomy in the selection of content activities. They attach importance to the improvement of their professional activities in order to enable the pupils to acquire knowledge and develop skills by taking a modern approach to the teaching process and making them ready and able to respond to the demands of the future and modern society.

This study was conceived as an exploratory qualitative research, where thirty-six primary and secondary school principals from the Catalan region in Spain responded to an open-ended questionnaire. In general, school principals showed commitment towards embedding sustainability education, however different views and understandings of sustainability and diverse levels of engagement and action were evidenced between schools. A number of constraining factors persist such as staff and students' engagement, lack of resources, governmental support and an overcrowded curriculum, while technology, community projects and school initiatives that engage students in decision-making processes are identified as clear enablers. Effective frameworks and professional development programmes are needed that help develop sustainability competencies amongst school principals and help operationalise sustainability education leadership within schools.

Design/methodology/approach This qualitative study conducted an explorative experiment to elaborate on forms to advance a pedagogical approach that embeds sustainability. The design of the pedagogical project was explorative and interdisciplinary, using a predefined framework on key competencies for sustainability. Findings The findings showed that an interdisciplinary approach can create a learning setting that stimulates students' problem-solving competencies for sustainability-related issues. Students were trained in the five key sustainable competencies addressed by Wiek et al. (2011). Moreover, although it is not always possible to arrange an interdisciplinary pedagogical setting, this might be a key condition for the development of students' key competencies regarding their understanding of the SDGs. Addressing the SDGs from an interdisciplinary perspective paved the way for the development of students' strategic competencies, including systems thinking and anticipatory competencies. Practical implications The pedagogical project, as an interdisciplinary explorative experiment, was shown to be a potentially suitable method to counteract "cherry-picking" approaches to teaching the SDGs at HEI. Originality/value The pedagogical approach advanced in this paper, extends active learning and interdisciplinarity in higher education. The authors argue that this approach encourages students to take ownership of and responsibility for their learning process and indicates a changed mindset and behavior.

J	Fokdal, J; Colic, R; Rodic, DM				Fokdal, Josefine; Colic, Ratka; Milovanovic Rodic, Danijela			Integrating sustainability in higher planning education through international cooperation Assessment of a pedagogical model and learning outcomes from the students' perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Learning outcomes; Education for sustainable development; Higher planning education; Pedagogical model; Students' perspective	KEY COMPETENCES; CO-CREATION; PROGRAMS; URBAN	Purpose This paper aims to supplement existing research on a joint approach to integrate sustainability into higher planning education (HPE) by facilitating an international transformative learning process. It looks at three different urban master's programs in Serbia (Belgrade) and Germany (Berlin and Stuttgart). Design/methodology/approach In this paper, students' assessments of the pedagogical model, individual learning outcomes and the long-term value of the pedagogical model in respect of key competences for sustainability are presented and discussed. Basic assumptions of the study include that assessment from the students' perspective can provide feedback on the transformational learning experience with the aim of improving the experience and thus learning outcomes; help identify limitations and target specific areas for improvement in the pedagogical model; and improve the evaluation of effectiveness in developing knowledge and skills for sustainability in HPE. Findings The paper provides evidence that a learner-centered and action-oriented approach, as well as a global dialogue among peers from different backgrounds and nationalities, is an effective way to educate future generations of urban planners to become "change agents" for societal transformation toward a more sustainable future within their respective contexts. Originality/value The paper is a supplement to the existing research on educational initiatives that attempts to integrate sustainability into the curricula, especially of urban-related programs; showcases outcomes of the pedagogical model(s) for sustainable development applied, especially when addressing the competences of students working in developing, transitional and developed countries or different geographic contexts; and shows long-term learning outcomes after the students move into work practice.

J	Moranska, D				Moranska, Danuta			The role of children's universities in developing key competences and universal skills of children and teenagers	E-MENTOR			English	Article						information society; cyber-culture; education; key competences		Civilization changes related to the development of information and communication technologies require the formation of new competences in the society, the possession of which will determine the quality of life in the digital world and rational participation in cyberculture. The implementation of this task becomes the special responsibility of educational institutions that aim at stimulating the growth of interests of children and youth in the areas of knowledge crucial for the development of the information society. It is extremely important to take actions supporting the development of logical and mathematical intelligence and digital competences. Their possession is of key importance for the conscious, rational and creative use of new technical possibilities. One of the important initiatives supporting this task is the organization of classes within children's universities. The article describes the projects undertaken at the Children's University of the Humanitas University in Sosnowiec. Their main goal is to provide conditions for facilitating the development of interest in science, through its popularization. The main assumption is to implement the idea of active learning in the digital environment. Through experiencing and experimenting with the use of information technology methods and means, children and adolescents can develop competences necessary for efficient functioning in the information society.

J	van Tryon, PJS; McDonald, J; Hirumi, A				van Tryon, Patricia J. Slagter; McDonald, Jason; Hirumi, Atsusi			Preparing the next generation of instructional designers: a cross-institution faculty collaboration	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Instructional design; Collaboration; Model; Teaching practices; Action research	ENVIRONMENTS	The ability of novice instructional designers to become skilled problem-solvers, who select and apply appropriate instructional design (ID) models in their work environments, are key competencies generally sought after in introductory ID courses. Yet, the proliferation of ID models, coupled with varied philosophies and practices about how ID is taught may pose challenges for ID educators seeking to prepare the next generation of leaders in the field. With little empirical research or documented best practices, ID educators are left to their own judgment about to how to navigate the practical challenges that can arise in the pursuit of their teaching goals. This paper shares insights on how ID educators across institutions teach introductory ID under varied conditions, and how ID educators can support each other in addressing challenges faced by those teaching introductory ID and seeking to improve their own practice. Using action research methods, we engaged in cross-institutional collaboration, sharing teaching approaches, philosophies, modes of delivery, instructional strategies, resources, models, and products of instructional design with each other as a means to understand and improve our own teaching practices. We also developed a model for cross-institutional faculty collaboration that is immersive, cyclical, and theory-based, and provides a guide for other ID educators to collectively engage in the work of supporting each other in the common goal of preparing the next generation of instructional design leaders.

J	Barak, M; Levenberg, A				Barak, Miri; Levenberg, Ariella			Flexible thinking in learning: An individual differences measure for learning in technology-enhanced environments	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Flexible thinking; Open-mindedness; Reliability; Technology-enhanced learning; Validation	5-FACTOR MODEL; ACCEPTANCE; PERFORMANCE; MOTIVATION; VALIDITY; DESIGN	In an era of global changes, flexible thinking is a key competency, necessary for learning in technology-enhanced environments. Advancements in instructional science and educational technologies call for an updated conceptualization of 'flexible thinking' to address current educational challenges. Echoing this need, the goal of this study was to re-conceptualize flexible thinking and to generate a valid and reliable instrument for measuring an individual's inclination to think flexibly in contemporary learning situations. A Six-stage study was designed to assess and validate the new instrument. As a result, the Flexible Thinking in Learning (FTL) scale was generated, consisting of three subscales: Acceptance of new or changing technologies, Open-mindedness to others' ideas, and Adapting to changes in learning situations. Within the framework of the current study, findings confirmed the FTL scale's content, construct, and concurrent validity, indicating stability across populations and over time. Consequently, the FTL scale may serve as both a research instrument and a self-assessment tool. It may assist in the evaluation of learners' inclination to think flexibly or in explaining individual differences regarding the utilization of new learning methods. Yet, generalizability should be carefully considered and additional studies should be conducted to examine the FTL scale among learners from different age groups and academic background.

Design/methodology/approach - Students who participated in an undergraduate internationally based research project were electronically surveyed. Questions sought responses related to demographics, the relevance of five "sustainability competencies" to the participant's employment, the degree to which the five competencies had been developed within the students' project and capabilities participants felt were important to their careers. Findings - Clearly supported was the relevance of all five sustainability competencies, especially that of "interpersonal competence". Practical implications - A problem-based learning (PBL) design guided the students' project and the findings indicate that these designs can be effective in delivering the five capabilities discussed. Interpersonal capability appears to be strongly developed, probably because PBL typically involves teamwork, often across disciplines. Nonetheless, those running these PBL-based subjects could note that careful design may be needed to ensure the development of systems thinking, anticipatory and normative capabilities. Also, the five competencies provide a reasonably good guide for what is important in the workplace and for designing learning experiences. Originality/value - Clarification of competencies valued in the workplace provides guidance for the design of higher education curricular so that graduates become effective sustainability professionals.

J	Hong, O; Song, J				Hong, Oksu; Song, Jinwoong			A componential model of Science Classroom Creativity (SCC) for understanding collective creativity in the science classroom	THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY			English	Article						Componential model; Collective creativity; Scientific creativity; Science classroom; Secondary education	SCIENTIFIC CREATIVITY; LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS; WORK-ENVIRONMENT; INNOVATION; ORGANIZATIONS; SCHOOL	Creativity, a key competency required for students to prepare for the future, has been emphasized in school-based science education in recent years. Some studies have proposed that a better understanding of the collective nature of creativity in group settings is essential for a full explanation of creativity. However, few attempts have been made to understand the collective nature of creativity in science classrooms. The purpose of this study is to conceptualize the creativity expressed by students learning individually or collectively in a science classroom by developing a componential model of science classroom creativity (SCC). We derive five dimensions of SCC (student characteristics, engagement in science class, science teacher support, science classroom environment, and creative behavior) from literature reviews. Then, critical incidents technique, classroom observations, and focus-group interviews are applied to identify SCC components reflecting real science education contexts. As a result, we develop an SCC model with 10 components and 24 subcomponents. Our SCC model provides a theoretical basis for understanding collective creativity in the science classroom, and it can also be used as a practical framework to analyze SCC in the science classroom.

J	Petrova, G; Kozarova, N				Petrova, Gabriela; Kozarova, Nina			Teaching foreign language to adults from the aspects of psychodidactic conception of education	JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL EDUCATION			English	Article						psychodidactics; education of adults; knowledge; structuring; constructivism; structuring tasks		Psychodidactic themes focused on the educational context have recently been resolved in both theoretical and research work. These themes are connected with general didactics, educational psychology, individual subject didactics, linguistics, philosophy, anthropology and neurosciences. Since the psychodidactic context of education is a widespectral and interdisciplinary topic, the present contribution deals with the issues of psychological aspects in the context of foreign language learning of adults. Good lecturers are looking for ways to help participants develop key competences. The support of lecturers has a chance to be successful especially when it is systematic and includes high-quality theoretical preparation. The aim of this paper is to attract attention, to a theoretical level, to using psychodidactic aspects during foreign language training of adults as well as to the building of competences necessary for the self-realisation of training course participants.

The research was carried out during the transition between the LOE and LOMCE Education Laws (academic year 20142015). Data were collected using an ad hoc questionnaire comprising 19 items requiring responses on a 5-point Likert scale. The sample comprised 443 science teachers in compulsory education in Spain. The results indicated that the way teachers perceived science and its scope and application in the classroom was unlikely to lead to the effective development of the scientific competence. Significant findings were discussed relating to the participating teachers' initial training, gender, type of school and stage of education. As a final component the didactic implications of teaching scientific competence were considered.

J	Klegeris, A; Gustafsson, E; Hurren, H				Klegeris, Andis; Gustafsson, Emelie; Hurren, Heather			Comparison of student marks obtained by an assessment panel reveals generic problem-solving skills and academic ability as distinct skill sets	COMPARE-A JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Undergraduate education; problem solving; student skills; assessments; higher education; correlation analysis	STRATEGIES; EDUCATION; ADULTHOOD; KNOWLEDGE; IMPACT; SELF	Generic problem-solving skills have been identified as one of the key competencies valued by professional programmes, university students and their future employers. A lack of widely available and simple testing tools prevents assessment of the development of student problem-solving skills. As part of a research study, a generic problem-solving test was administered to 130 third-year science students during three consecutive years. A comparison between the scores students achieved in this test with their six academic marks obtained in this course showed no significant correlation. Lack of correlation between the problem-solving skill test scores and academic marks of students was confirmed in a larger population of students participating in a campus-wide study of generic problem-solving skills (n = 830). Problem solving and academic performance may represent two independent skill sets of students; testing problem-solving skills of students could be introduced to achieve a more comprehensive evaluation of undergraduate student progress and achievement.

The purpose of this study is to examine the preferred learning styles of students as predictors of critical thinking development in online learning. The study involved 489 random third-year students enrolled in different faculties at [BLINDED] University and [BLINDED] Institute. The mean age of respondents was 21 years. This research used the Felder-Soloman's Index of Learning Styles, the 2011 version of the Watson Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal (W-GCTA) test, and a Critical Thinking Test (Level 1) developed by Nikita Nepryakhin. Statistical data processing was done using an online calculator. An effectively designed online course that promotes critical thinking should take into account various factors that influence learners' perception of course material, such as individual styles of learning. To adapt to online learning, students must have a balanced learning profile. This study shows a correlation between preferred learning styles and levels of critical thinking, which must be considered when developing the online learning curriculum and online lesson plans. The results of the study will enable students to better organize their own learning. Teachers can use this information to optimize the course design.

Design/methodology/approach To explore the principles linked with the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the learning and teaching practices in sustainability at the International University of Catalonia (Universitat Internacional de Catalunya, UIC, in Catalan), an empirical study was carried out by using a mixed methodology for data collection. Indicators related to SDGs found in the University curriculum (quantitative analysis) were measured using Excel, combined with in-depth semi-structured interviews to the deans of different faculties (qualitative study), which were analysed using Atlas.ti. Findings Several visions, difficulties and challenges were identified in this mixed-method study around the concept of sustainability, which allowed the authors to describe and portray a specific starting position in relation to the SDGs at the UIC. Research limitations/implications The presence of dimensions linked to the SDGs in the University curriculum were analysed by means of a quantitative study. However, global competences related to education for sustainable development were not studied. Practical implications Special emphasis was given to the challenges and opportunities for training future graduates and the whole University community in SD. Originality/value This paper shows a methodological exploration of the principles related to the SDGs and the learning and teaching practices in sustainability in higher education.

J	Fairley, MJ				Fairley, Mariah J.			Conceptualizing Language Teacher Education Centered on Language Teacher Identity Development: A Competencies-Based Approach and Practical Applications	TESOL QUARTERLY			English	Article							EXPLORING LANGUAGE; PERSPECTIVES; PEDAGOGIES; EMOTIONS; INQUIRY; POWER; EFL	Language teacher identity (LTI) has become an increasingly central focus in language teaching recently, perhaps because identity is now defined as multiple, complex, shifting, socially constructed, and a site of struggle (Norton, 2013; Song, 2016)-and thus a construct that can and should be intentionally influenced (Varghese, Motha, Park, Reeves, & Trent, 2016). With greater understanding that social justice and a critical orientation to education are not only important but also the duty of educators to enact (Kubota & Miller, 2017), some advocate the placement of LTI development at the center of language teacher education (LTE; De Costa & Norton, 2017a; Varghese et al., 2016). However, the conceptualization of such intentional models of LTE needs development (Varghese et al., 2016). This article begins to conceptualize such an LTE program. The author theorizes LTI and the need for adopting an LTI that is transformative, agentive, and advocacy (TAA)-oriented, and proposes a competencies-based approach as a foundation for developing an LTE program centered on the development of a TAA-oriented LTI, suggesting key competencies to include in such an approach. She presents practical affordances and activities that could be helpful in developing these competencies. The article ends with questions aimed at furthering this emerging scholarly conversation in the field.

The purpose of the article is to analyze the experience of developing a student's ability to collective learning activity in modern conditions. Collective learning activities involve adherence to the principle of cooperation, which is aimed at the joint achievement of results. The article reveals the features of the formation of the educational team, the ways of influencing the effectiveness of collective work and the formation of the structure of interpersonal relations between students.

J	Gonzalez, JMG; Montano, JLA; Hassall, T				Gonzalez, Jose Maria G.; Arquero Montano, Jose Luis; Hassall, Trevor			The change towards a teaching methodology based on competences: a case study in a Spanish university	RESEARCH PAPERS IN EDUCATION			English	Article						European higher education area; Spanish higher education; teaching methodologies; competences; institutional theory	HIGHER-EDUCATION; ADOPTION	The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has promoted the implementation of a teaching methodology based on competences. Drawing on New Institutional Sociology, the present work aims to identify and improve knowledge concerning the factors which are hindering that change in the Spanish university system. This is investigated using a case study based on a Spanish university which is a pioneer in the implementation of a competence-based curriculum. The results show that factors identified and analysed are conditioning the change and causing a ceremonial adoption of the competence-based system by the teaching staff. The results of the study may be of use as a reference and orientation for educators and administrators as well as for the regulators of those countries integrated within the EHEA. The study may prove useful in the analysis of inertia factors present when designing and implementing the policies and measures necessary to achieve a comprehensive teaching methodology; one which incorporates learning and assessment of competences in a real manner.

The Key Competencies of Mobile Learning Scale (KCMLS) was determined via confirmatory factor analysis to have four dimensions: team collaboration, creative thinking, critical thinking and problem solving, and communication. The research subjects are 815 students from the elementary school that participate in M-learning programme in Taiwan. The research results show that students have better self-awareness in team collaboration and creative thinking, but have worse self-awareness in critical thinking and problem solving. This study also found that there was no significant difference between genders in the KCMLS, but students who study in the schools that committed in M-learning longer have higher awareness in all dimensions than students who study in the schools that committed to M-learning in fewer years.

J	Parrado-Martinez, P; Sanchez-Andujar, S				Parrado-Martinez, Purificacion; Sanchez-Andujar, Sonia			Development of competences in postgraduate studies of finance: A project-based learning (PBL) case study	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS EDUCATION			English	Article						Project-based learning; Competences; Students' perceptions; Higher education; Finance	KNOWLEDGE; STUDENTS	The methodological paradigm advanced in European higher education during recent decades focuses on the concept of 'competence' to achieve student employability. This professionalization of education requires more flexible and active teaching-learning contexts. This paper presents an empirical research into the application of project-based learning (PBL) in postgraduate studies of finance in the University of Jaen (Spain). Considering the important role that students' perspective plays in their own motivation and performance, we pursue three main objectives. First, we aim to analyse students' perceptions of the effectiveness of this methodology to improve some key competences for student employability. Second, we explore whether the perceived utility of these competences changes after the PBL experiment. Finally, we aim to explore students' opinion about the usefulness, advantages and disadvantages of this method. Our findings support the perceived effectiveness of PBL for improving teamwork, communication, creativity, organization and information management competences. In addition, results show that students were highly satisfied, emphasizing the superiority of PBL in comparison with traditional learning methods, and its usefulness for learning about financing sources and to making contact with the business world.

J	Lambrechts, W; Van Liedekerke, L; Van Petegem, P				Lambrechts, Wim; Van Liedekerke, Luc; Van Petegem, Peter			Higher education for sustainable development in Flanders: balancing between normative and transformative approaches	ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH			English	Article						Dewey; higher education; philosophy of education; sustainable development; transformative	ENVIRONMENTAL-EDUCATION; KEY COMPETENCES; INTEGRATION; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; PROGRAMS; FUTURE	This paper provides critical reflections on higher education for sustainable development (HESD) from a philosophical perspective. A theoretical framework is developed, based on John Dewey's thoughts on the aim of democracy and the critical role of education herein, and with specific focus on two constructs: initiative and adaptability' and values and virtues'. This theoretical framework is used to analyze HESD in Flanders, from a historical and socio-political perspective. The Flemish case shows a gradual evolution from a focus on environmental management on campus, followed by a normative interpretation of what HESD should look like, and a more transformative approach in light of citizenship and democratic ideals. The case also shows considerable exchange of information between Flanders and the Netherlands, in which Dutch models and instruments were used in the Flemish context. The philosophical perspective provides a theoretical grounding of the field of HESD, which enables us to further develop the field, with a specific focus on initiative and adaptability on the one hand, and the importance of a virtues perspective on the other.

The study was a cross-national, multiple case study and data were collected through 18 focus group dialogues with 15-year-old pupils. Results showed that English pupils were much more well-informed about rights and responsibilities than their Nordic counterparts and also more skilled rhetorically, but appeared less accustomed to open and confident relationships with adults than the Swedish pupils. Finnish pupils did not seem to be encouraged to talk; instead they kept their thoughts and feelings to themselves. One conclusion, among others, was that the study illuminates conditions for the development of a so-called key competence - i.e., 'interpersonal, intercultural, social and civic competence'.

We assessed pre-service geography teachers' (n = 100) competencies and attitudes towards the official, German ESD orientation framework to determine the specific need for higher education action. The results are a high competence assessment and even higher importance assigned to the ESD-related professional competencies. In the context of ESD, pre-service teachers are most confident in their content knowledge and social and personal competencies and least confident in their pedagogical knowledge. The cross-sectional analysis shows the perceived competence level rising with the semester number and a strong positive influence of the school practice module.

A Rasch and factor analysis of an Indonesian version of the Student Perception of Opportunity Competence Development (SPOCD) questionnaire	COGENT EDUCATION			English	Article						factor analysis; Rasch modeling; rating scale model; Student Performance Opportunity of Competence Development (SPOCD) questionnaire	CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; SCALE DEVELOPMENT; MODEL; FIT; DEPENDENCE	This study is the first to investigate and validate the psychometric properties of an Indonesian translation of the Student Performance Opportunity of Competence Development (SPOCD) questionnaire that covers five key competencies related to the mathematics learning process, namely: (1) thinking; (2) relating to others; (3) using language, symbols and text; (4) managing self, and; (5) participating and contributing. The SPOCD questionnaire comprises 30 items, with a 5-point Likert scale. A total of 1413 Indonesian high-school students (46.4% male, 53.6% female) from three regions (eastern, western and central Indonesia), aged from 16 to 19 years and ranging from the 10th to the 12th grade, completed the SPOCD questionnaire. A Rasch rating scale model (RSM) and confirmatory factor analysis were applied to evaluate the psychometric characteristics and factor structure of the SPOCD questionnaire. The results indicated that assumptions of unidimensionality, local independence and monotonicity of the SPOCD questionnaire were met. In the Rasch RSM assessment, the SPOCD questionnaire response set worked well, matched the threshold estimates and functioned as an appropriate model for the response categories. The SPOCD questionnaire showed excellent psychometric characteristics for use in measuring the development of competence in middle school students in Indonesia.

C.; Bhati, Abhishek			Shifting landscapes in higher education: a case study of transferable skills and a networked classroom in South-East Asia	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF EDUCATION			English	Article						Networked classrooms; higher education; transferable knowledge and skills; employability skills; South-East Asia	GRADUATE EMPLOYABILITY; SOFT SKILLS; PERCEPTIONS	The rapidly changing workforce of the C21st places increasing demands on higher education institutions to produce graduates who possess sound academic credentials and key skills, and who furthermore demonstrate the ability to transfer knowledge and skills from their studies to the workplace. This paper begins with a definition of key/core skills, followed by a discussion of how they relate to transferable skills. A review of literature regarding the transference of skills from tertiary settings to workplaces in South-East Asia reveals that most literature of the region addresses key competencies rather than the transferable skills that employers value. Transferable skills are further analysed in the context of networked spaces of learning and the theory of connectivist learning. A case study of one networked classroom (NC) of an Australian university in Singapore is presented, highlighting how engagement in problem-based and project-based learning contributes to the development of transferable skills. Results indicate that the spatial and material resources of the NC intersect with practice-based learning experiences assisting students in skills acquisition by providing a teaching and learning space in which to apply transferable skills. Implications of this study point to the need for further research regarding embedding transferable skills within higher education curricula.

J	Caena, F				Caena, Francesca			BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER: INDUCTION POINTERS FOR TEACHER LEADERSHIP	PROFESORADO-REVISTA DE CURRICULUM Y FORMACION DE PROFESORADO			English	Article						beginning teachers; professional training; teacher characteristics; teacher leadership; teacher supervision	EXPERIENCES	The first years of teaching are decisive to shape teachers' motivation and attitudes, as adaptive professionals that respond to fast changing contexts. This career stage should provide acculturation in collaborative professional communities that discuss and tackle growing challenges for learners' improvement. Induction support can be key for the personal, social, and professional development of beginning teachers, fostering their leadership to influence and initiate practice change. It needs to be flexible and sensitive to specific education contexts, but it benefits from transversal principles grounded on common European policies. Induction should be embedded in a continuum approach that links it to other career stages -relying on broad, common teacher requirements. The COVID 19 crisis has foregrounded the competences teachers require to ensure equitable learning. Among European Key Competences, the Personal, Social and Learning to Learn Competence and the Digital Competence can play a crucial role for teachers grappling with distance teaching and unpredictable professional conditions. While Digital competence is fully acknowledged to be key for teacher professionalism, Personal, Social and Learning to Learn is now becoming crucial for teachers' motivation, innovation, and distributed leadership, to face problematic scenarios.

J	Clark, PG				Clark, Phillip G.			Potentials and pitfalls of networking in interdisciplinary education: Taking on the challenges in Gerontology and Geriatrics	GERONTOLOGY & GERIATRICS EDUCATION			English	Article						Interdisciplinary; interprofessional; networking; education; competencies		Gerontology and geriatrics are quintessentially interdisciplinary fields. To understand aging, an interdisciplinary perspective is necessary; to provide quality care to older adults with complex, chronic conditions, an interprofessional team is required. Academic, clinical, and community-based settings - with their vertical organizational structures - need bridging strategies to create networks that support interdisciplinary education in both classroom and experiential settings. Taking on these challenges requires emphasizing the importance of key competencies that integrate the unique perspectives, contributions, and roles of different disciplines, and creating the connections critical for promoting interdisciplinary education. First, this paper develops a theoretical foundation for networking to construct and maintain educational and service provider partnerships. Second, the organizational and institutional requirements for successful networking are explored, based on both empirical research and principles from the theoretical framework. Finally, practical recommendations for the development of key strategies for implementing and sustaining interdisciplinary and academic-clinical-community partnerships are summarized.

J	Telling, K; Serapioni, M				Telling, Kathryn; Serapioni, Martino			The rise and change of the competence strategy: Reflections on twenty-five years of skills policies in the EU	EUROPEAN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article						Competence; skills policy; social investment; Europeanisation; learning outcomes; knowledge economy	KEY COMPETENCES; EDUCATION; CONSTRUCTIONS; CURRICULUM; EUROPE	The principal aim of this article is to provide a historical overview of 25 years of competence policy in the European Union, highlighting connections between past and current initiatives and outlining possible scenarios for the decade to come. The article presents the social investment turn in social policy as the critical political background against which the emergence of a competence strategy in European Union education policy should be analysed and understood. The competence strategy, it is argued, finds its roots in a renewed attention at the European Union level for harmonising educational outputs and labour market demands. While trying to produce a schematic history of the emergence and change of the competence strategy, the article does not seek to offer strict definitions of competence itself; instead, it conveys the nebulous and context-dependent nature of the concept.

Research on entrepreneurship started in the field of economics, although in recent decades the individual skills and attitudes it involves have become more important and there has been more interest in teaching and learning about the subject. Although some research has found a positive relationship between Entrepreneurship Education (EE) and entrepreneurial behavior, the relationship is not clear and the results are contradictory. The level of entrepreneurial initiative shown prior to any EE seems to be the variable that best explains the different results. Objective: The aim of this paper is to determine which individual differences can best identify those university students with a strong entrepreneurial attitude. Method: The sample was made up of 514 students from six Spanish universities, who were divided into two groups corresponding to individuals with high and low entrepreneurial intention. A step-by-step logistic regression analysis was performed resulting in a model in which the variables of emotional repair, low neuroticism and agreeableness were significant. Results: This model allows us to correctly forecast 62.20% of cases. Discussion: These findings are important for work on models that allow us to identify the profiles of potential entrepreneurs. The results are interesting in terms of the relationship between entrepreneurial education and intention and the investigation of whether an entrepreneurial intention profile, such as the one found in this research, could improve EE results and facilitate the transition from intention to action in entrepreneurial behavior.

It presents an online survey conducted among Russian and Azerbaijan entrepreneurs, which allowed identifying key competencies necessary to practice a flourishing business activity in the current environment. The role of start-ups in strengthening and upgrading entrepreneurship students' professional competencies was identified based on self-assessment of their professional progress during educational training. The research methodology made it possible to identify levers of influence on students' involvement in training, the effective usage of which can dramatically change the quality of future specialists' education due to the synergy of theoretical and practical activities. Using a survey of 50 Russian and Azerbaijani entrepreneurs, selected using a series of filters and based on a random sample, a list of entrepreneurs' competencies and skills was formed. Checking by the Cronbach method a demonstrated the acceptability of the internal reliability of the resulting list (alpha =.821). This list was used to survey 395 students from 5 Russian and one Azerbaijani universities using the method of assessing on a 4-point Likert scale their results in entrepreneurship training after The practical vocational training in the "Start-up Projects - New Generation" ecosystem, described in this study. The students' assessment of the level of development of their vocational skills turned out to be relevantly high. In practice, the research results can be applied in the creation of entrepreneurship training courses, as well as with the aim of increasing student entrepreneurship motivation and enhancing their practical experience.

J	Frank, P; Sundermann, A; Fischer, D				Frank, Pascal; Sundermann, Anna; Fischer, Daniel			How mindfulness training cultivates introspection and competence development for sustainable consumption	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Sustainable consumption; Qualitative content analysis; Reflectivity; Higher education for sustainable consumption; Mindfulness; Introspection; Key competencies for sustainable consumption	KEY COMPETENCES; AWARENESS; CONSCIOUSNESS	Purpose This paper aims to explore the relationship between introspection and key competencies for sustainable consumption (KCSCs). It investigates whether mindfulness training can cultivate the ability to introspect and stimulate the development of KCSCs. Design/methodology/approach Two independent studies were analyzed. Data were retrieved from interviews with participants of a consumer-focused mindfulness training (Study 1, 11 participants), as well as from diaries of students attending a university seminar with mindfulness training (Study 2, 13 students), and made subject to qualitative content analysis. Findings Both studies show a clear intersection between both constructs and suggest that mindfulness training can contribute to the development of KCSCs and learners' ability to introspect. The studies also demonstrated that introspection is not equally related to all competencies and that KCSCs must not be reduced to introspection. Research limitations/implications - Both KCSCs and introspection are complex and latent constructs and hence challenging to observe. The research understands itself as a first exploratory approach for empirically investigating this complex relation. Originality/value While increasing (self-)reflectivity is at the core of competence-based education, a systematic engagement with the practice of introspection as a means to enhancing reflectivity is surprisingly lacking. Mindfulness training could be a promising way to cultivate introspective abilities and thus facilitate learning processes that are conducive to competence development.

J	Laus, K; Opic, S				Laus, Kristina; Opic, Sinisa			DEVELOPMENT OF ENTREPRENEURIAL COMPETENCES IN PRIMARY SCHOOL SYSTEM IN THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA, WITH A FOCUS ON COMPETENCES FOR SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP	PEDAGOGIKA-PEDAGOGY			English	Article						entrepreneurial competences; social entrepreneurship; key competences; Curriculum		In order for education system objectives to have a positive impact on the economic prosperity of the country, but also with the aim of developing a "culture of self-reliance", entrepreneurial competence is one of eight key competences whose development is recommended by the European Union. This paper analyzes to what extent the learning outcomes defined by the Croatian national curriculum encourage the development of entrepreneurial competence in elementary education in Croatia and to what extent is this contributed by the Primary School Curriculum. The focus is also on promoting development of competences for social entrepreneurship, a business model that is not only aimed at gaining profit, but also an active contribution to well-being and sustainability of the local community. First part of the paper defines the area of competence and social entrepreneurship. The central part of the paper consists of an analysis of the National Curriculum Framework and a review of the Primary School Curriculum and the competence of teachers and professors. The paper also analyses curricular documents with the current Comprehensive Curricular Reform. In the final part, recommendations are given to improve the existing model for development of entrepreneurial competences. The analysis showed that necessity for developing entrepreneurial competence is recognized at the national level, but the incentive is primarily expressed at a declarative level and requires a systematic upgrade of the existing curriculum, and in particular the education of teachers and professors. There is an opportunity to upgrade it within the current proposal of Comprehensive Curricular Reform.

J	Isenmann, R; Landwehr-Zloch, S; Zinn, S				Isenmann, Ralf; Landwehr-Zloch, Sabine; Zinn, Sascha			Morphological box for ESD - landmark for universities implementing education for sustainable development (ESD)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION			English	Article						Education for sustainable development (ESD); Morphological box; Responsible management education; Wilhelm buchner hochschule; Mobile university of technology (WBH); Munich university of applied research (MUAS)	RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT EDUCATION; ENGINEERING-EDUCATION; DEVELOPMENT GOALS; KEY COMPETENCES; FUTURE; CURRICULUM; DECADE; FRAMEWORK; COURSES; DESIGN	Universities have various options to implement higher education for sustainable development (ESD) into curricula and syllabi, and incorporate sustainability into students' daily routine and life on campus. Despite considerable progress they have made in the last years, a comprehensive system for ESD that goes beyond good practice examples is still missing. This gap becomes obvious in surveys applying a systems approach to ESD, describing emerging research areas, mapping opportunities of responsible management education or identifying future trends for ESD. Seeking to close the gap, the opportunities of how to implement ESD into universities' curricula and syllabi are arranged to a comprehensive system covering all possible options: the so-called "morphological box for ESD". The methodology applied to develop the morphological box for ESD is the morphological approach. The morphological approach provides a powerful heuristic tool for creative problem solving, used to investigate the totality of realizations of multidimensional, non-quantifiable phenomena, like ESD implementation. The morphological box for ESD provides more than 70 million opportunities to implement ESD. Universities may use this morphological box for ESD to find out their unique profile and develop proper ways to implement ESD. The morphological box for ESD is the first of its kind.

J	Hellne-Halvorsen, EB; Lahn, LC; Nore, H				Hellne-Halvorsen, Ellen Beate; Lahn, Leif Christian; Nore, Haege			Writing Competences in Norwegian Vocational Education and Training:-How Students and Apprentices Express their Professional Competences	VOCATIONS AND LEARNING			English	Article						Generic and professional writing competencies; Text composition analysis; Vocational education and training; Case-based test; Writing as key competency		This article analyzes the writing competence of Norwegian students and apprentices in three professions: Healthcare, industrial mechanics and electricians. The research forms part of a large-scale assessment project in vocational education and training (VET). A subset of 108 written test-answers were subjected to an explorative analysis focusing on generic and professional writing competencies. A more text-based and trans-contextual working life for many professions requires not only profession-specific communicative competency, but also a stronger engagement in generic literacy practices. The need for written communication with customers, clients and colleagues across workplaces and countries has increased and the use of understandable language when communicating with non-peers is required. In the study, we found that the generic writing competency declined during apprenticeship, but on the other hand that the use of professional-specific terminology increased. We also found that writing competence seemed to be contextualized according to different traditions, text cultures and discourses across the three professions. The article questions the prevalence of text-based examinations in VET and analytical categories for measuring writing competence that do not take into account a multimodal character of professional communication.

Since 2006 digital skills and competence has been embedded as key competence in the Norwegian national curriculum. A sample of 593 Norwegian students from 43 upper secondary schools participated in a survey with a digital competence quiz and a self-report questionnaire. Analysis showed differences in students' digital competence and indication of digital diversity on both student and school level. A multilevel analysis reveals that cultural capital, language integration at home, self-efficacy, strategic use of information and average grades of the students predict 20% of the variation in students' digital competence score and 49% of the variation between schools' average digital competence score.

This study aimed to explore the teaching competencies general education teachers in Botswana primary schools perceived as important to their teaching in inclusive classrooms. Using a quantitative research approach, 116 general education primary school teachers completed a 14-Item questionnaire titled Perceived Competencies for Inclusive Teaching Scale, and an open-ended question about the supportive resources they required to be effective in their classrooms. Descriptive statistics, ANOVA and t-tests were used to analyse the data. The results of this study showed that participants identified adaptive instructional competencies (including setting curricula goals, modifying learning content and teaching to the different learning styles of students) as most important. Human resources (teacher aides, specialist teachers,) followed by material resources were seen to be key support resources required for them to be able to implement IE. This study could be used as a baseline for future research on key competencies and resources for primary school teachers for inclusive education.

It is present everywhere: in the business world, civil services, education, at home. The ability to search, choose and use relevant data and information among endless choices, offered by the modern technology, is also seen as a key competence. This article presents the influence which the ICY has on the development of four-year-old children's competences. The present issue is a part of an extensive study which also deals with children's access to the ICT and its usage at home. The data was gathered with the help of 130 parents, who filled out a questionnaire and provided us with their opinions about their children's usage of the ICY at home. We discovered that the ICT influences the development of certain competences to some extent. We also tried to see if there are any differences based on the child's gender and parents' level of education.

This multiple-case study drew on the experiences of teachers from four schools in the south of Spain. The data source has been the focus groups in which the teachers took part. The transcripts were analysed thematically by three researchers who devised a system of categories designed through an iterative process. The findings reveal the paucity of tasks used to assess reading, listening and oral expression. The study also shows the diverse problems faced by teachers when it comes to evaluating communicative competence. This paper highlights the need to rethink the curricular contents and the methods applied to assess communicative competence in primary schools.

J	Njura, HJ; Kaberia, IK; Taaliu, ST				Njura, Hellen Joseph; Kaberia, Isaac Kubai; Taaliu, Simon Thuranira			Effect of agricultural teaching approaches on skills development for food security: a case of secondary schools in Embu County, Kenya	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION & EXTENSION			English	Article						Agricultural teaching approaches; effect; food security; practical; relevance; skills development		Purpose: To investigate the effect of the agricultural teaching approaches employed in secondary schools on skills development for food security in Kenya.Design/Methodology/Approach: Descriptive survey design was employed targeting 46,340 students and 235 agriculture teachers. The actual sample size constituted 490 students in 20 focus discussion groups and 111 agriculture teachers. Data was collected using an Agriculture Teachers' Interview Schedule and a Students' Focus Group Discussion Guide. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using inferential statistics and content analysis respectively.Findings: The agricultural teaching approaches employed in secondary schools positively contributed to skills development leading to increased food security. However, the low integration of practical agriculture with hands on experiences derailed adequate skills development and their application for food security.Practical implication: The findings of the study may be used as inputs for the Kenyan education policymakers to develop a guideline on incorporation of agriculture practical sessions on school timetables, school community-based agriculture projects and holiday-based field attachments for students for better skills development as targeted by the Competence Based Curriculum (CBC).Theoretical Implications: This paper makes a contribution to the growing body of knowledge by highlighting learning opportunities that can create more hands-on skills driven towards food security in any country.Originality/value: In current studies on secondary school agriculture in developing countries, a framework which incorporates school community-based projects and field attachments is hardly found. When incorporated into the theory, the approaches can be avenues for enhancing food security from the secondary school level.

The development of world society is accompanied by a wide range of adaptation challenges, such as the development of global social justice, the overcoming of paternalism or the facilitation of social solidarity and dealing with migration in an era of climate change. This paper reflects the learning of the understanding of world society by empirical studies. The paper shows some challenges for the research agenda, especially concerning the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's framework of global competences and suggests a framework for further research.

J	Escalie, G; Recoules, N; Chalies, S; Legrain, P				Escalie, Guillaume; Recoules, Nicolas; Chalies, Sebastien; Legrain, Pascal			Helping students build competences in physical education: theoretical proposals and illustrations	SPORT EDUCATION AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Learning; teaching; competence; experience; physical education	WITTGENSTEIN	In the French education system, the current curriculum for students from the primary to the end of secondary school is structured around the notion of key competence. A competence can be defined as an integrated and stable network of knowledge and know-how, with normative behaviors, procedures and types of reasoning. However, without a theoretical conceptualization of building and mobilization processes, the components of a competence are considered as isolated and not interconnected. In the health and physical education (HPE) setting, too few empirical studies have analyzed how teachers would contribute to the development of student's competence. The aim of this forward-looking article grounded on an experiential and cultural framework consists in clarifying and illustrating a conceptualization of the dynamics of development of competences among students considering the teacher activity. This theoretical framework seems to offer heuristic possibilities for the examination of teaching and learning practices which contribute to the development of the key competences, particularly when a competence is read as an experience that integrates multiple dimensions. Based on audio-video recording of PE lessons and self-confrontation interviews with the teacher and a student, the results of the present study strengthen the criticism of the definition of competence emphasizing the relevance to adopt a holistic approach corresponding to the articulation of intertwined resources (i.e. motor, methodological and social) students allocate to act in PE groups. Furthermore, the results show that the competence building depends on various roles students have the opportunity to play in PE (i.e. observer, tutor). Finally, our results underline the importance of identifying the specific characteristics of the teacher activity designed to structure the learning environment to train students to acquire new competences transferable in society.

J	Deleye, M; Van Poeck, K; Block, T				Deleye, Maarten; Van Poeck, Katrien; Block, Thomas			Lock-ins and opportunities for sustainability transition A multi-level analysis of the Flemish higher education system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Sustainability; Higher education; Transition; Policy entrepreneurs; Multi-level perspective	KEY COMPETENCES; NEED	Purpose - This study aims to provide an overview of sustainability in Flemish higher education (HE) by using the multi-level perspective (MLP) on sustainability transitions for a comprehensive empirical analysis of how sustainability is embedded in Flemish HE. Design/methodology/approach - MLP was used as analytical framework to study the case and allow a focus on the interplay between innovative experiments in niche-practices, the characteristics of the prevailing regime (dominant structures, cultures and practices) and macro-trends at the landscape level. The data were collected through document analyses, surveys, in-depth interviews and a focus group. The empirical analysis was complemented with an extensive literature study. Findings - In all, 9 landscape trends, 21 regime characteristics and 5 types of niches are identified. Furthermore, the multi-level analysis revealed 5 important lock-ins in the dominant regime that impede the upscaling of sustainable niches, 5 internal contradictions that destabilise the regime and can thus create windows of opportunity for niches to become viable alternatives and 16 opportunities for further embedding sustainability in HE. Originality/value - The paper gives an original insight into the complexities of integrating sustainability in HE, highlights the important role of policy entrepreneurs to grasp emerging opportunities and offers them insight into how to create momentum and identify and fruitfully address windows of opportunity for a sustainability transition.

Building it into the educational system requires a solid theoretical model that researchers share, but there is currently a lack of agreement among academics. This work aims to check the theoretical model proposed by the research team against the opinions of key informants. This model has five dimensions - cognitive, metacognitive, affective-motivational, social-relational, and ethical-aswell as twenty subdimensions. The first three dimensions come from the literature about strategic and self-regulated learning and have been present since research into this topic began. The fourth comes from the social-cognitive approach and has more recently been added into explanatory models. The fifth one is an original contribution by this group. Our research focusses on the university setting and the aim of the present work is to verify our model with some of the key informants involved in the process (students, teachers, professionals, and employers). A qualitative methodology was used, featuring twelve discussion groups, one for each group in the three participating universities (N = 67). The participants were asked a general question about LTL and then their contributions were recorded. These contributions were then transcribed and processed using Atlas ti.8. to compare them with the theoretical model. The presence and importance of established dimensions and subdimensions was analysed, considering the frequency of comments and their connections and interrelationships. The results corroborated the model proposed by the research team: all the dimensions and almost all of the subdimensions appeared in the participants' comments. The next stage in the research process is to develop a standardised assessment instrument, based on the model, so it can be statistically validated with university students.

J	Uus, O; Mettis, K; Valjataga, T				Uus, Onne; Mettis, Kadri; Valjataga, Terje			Self-directed learning: A case-study of school students scientific knowledge construction outdoors	COGENT EDUCATION			English	Article						working memory capacity; complex learning; cognitive load; outdoor-learning; executive functions; young learners	WORKING-MEMORY; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE; BLOOMS TAXONOMY; SCIENCE; ATTENTION; DESIGN; IMPLEMENTATION; INSTRUCTION; PERCEPTIONS	Prior findings highlight school students' low motivation to study science, while 21st-century education aims to achieve their key competencies: scientific literacy and autonomous problem-solving to be prepared for smooth adaption to quickly changing circumstances. Real-life learning scenarios can meet these shortfalls to engage the learners by the knowledge-in-use perspective. This, however, requires that learners have high-level abilities of complex learning. We conducted a case study of outdoor learning with 8th-graders (age 14-15) to foster their scientific thinking addressing a real-life problem hands-on. Although the results showed that students' conceptual knowledge increased, they also indicate participants' cognitive taxonomy difficulties. An insight into the cognitive load aspects is given as it may appear in different autonomous learning situations. This work highlights the aspects little discussed so far (1) school students' varying cognitive skills; (2) difficulties arising from the high cognitive load caused by multitasking, accompanied by the complex learning approach. This raises the questions of how to conduct motivating science lessons, where to practice the multi-component learning skills; and how to foster autonomous learning, where to gain the relevant knowledge without overburdening novice learners.

Design/methodology/approach - The "STSE" course is part of the department's Professional Development Program. The course aims to articulate the relationship between ESD processes and university educator training through reflection on their practices. To accomplish this objective, the course promotes interdisciplinary groups of educators from different backgrounds. These groups are encouraged to introspect regarding their pedagogical styles. A survey is applied to encourage self-analysis of the four pedagogical style dimensions. Findings - University educators adopt their own pedagogical styles based on the evolution of their practices. This information is useful in generating education, formation and transformation of new professionals in their respective fields. This knowledge also raises questions about ESD, and the construction of processes, values and attitudes to aid this education. Research limitations/implications - This paper only describes the characterization stage of the university educator pedagogical styles through practice-related self-analysis Originality/value - This study builds pedagogical knowledge, promotes higher education transformation for sustainable development and strengthens the quality of university education.

J	Morselli, D				Morselli, Daniele			How do Italian vocational teachers educate for a sense of initiative and entrepreneurship? Development and initial application of the SIE questionnaire	EDUCATION AND TRAINING			English	Article						Italy; Teaching; Lifelong learning; Enterprise education; Key competence; Sense of initiative and entrepreneurship	COMPETENCE-BASED EDUCATION; ENTERPRISE EDUCATION; SECONDARY-EDUCATION; TEACHING-METHODS; FUTURE; STUDENTS; SCHOOLS; IMPACT; SIDE	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how educators can teach the key competence of a sense of initiative and entrepreneurship (SIE) as a cross-curricular subject in compulsory education. It draws both on the literature relating to entrepreneurial education and on competence-based education to set out five features of entrepreneurial teaching. For illustrative purposes, these five characteristics are explored in a questionnaire put to a small group of teaching staff. Design/methodology/approach This study employs a qualitative approach, seeking to understand the personal perspectives of participants, and drawing out the complexities of their behaviour, whilst also providing a holistic interpretation of such behaviour. Findings The literature review identifies five features of entrepreneurial teaching: embedding learning outcomes for a SIE within taught subjects; active entrepreneurial teaching; educating for entrepreneurial attitudes; networking activities; being entrepreneurial as part of lifelong learning. It can be hypothesised that teaching staff teach different aspects of the SIE depending on the subject they teach (vocational or more traditional) and their role (teacher or workshop assistant). Originality/value Development of the SIE and the five characteristics of entrepreneurial teaching is a first step towards understanding how secondary vocational teachers and workshop assistants understand and teach the SIE as cross-curricular subject. In line with Fayolle and Gailly who called for deeper investigation of the most effective combinations of objectives, content and teaching methods, the paper seeks to establish a relationship between teaching methods, development of entrepreneurial attitudes and assessment.

In our research group, we developed a competence model that distinguishes four dimensions of systems thinking in ESD. Based on this model, we designed different university courses in biology and geography teacher education and measured their effects on student teachers' systems thinking and the pedagogical content knowledge for teaching systems thinking with two different tests. Both variables could be effectively promoted depending on the course.

J	Almeida, F; Buzady, Z				Almeida, Fernando; Buzady, Zoltan			Development of soft skills competencies through the use of FLIGBY	TECHNOLOGY PEDAGOGY AND EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						Serious game; FLIGBY; soft skills; higher education; leadership development	SERIOUS GAMES; CREATIVITY; STUDENTS	Traditionally, serious games have been used in the development of hard skills, particularly in technical areas such as health, engineering, defence or the environment. However, they can also be applied in the assessment and development of soft skills, which are increasingly key competencies for an individual in the twenty-first century. In this sense, this study proposes the adoption of the FLIGBY serious game in a higher education institution to evaluate and develop students' skills in this field. The findings indicate a large correspondence between the soft skills fundamental to the twenty-first century and the assessment dimensions recorded by the game. Furthermore, the findings reveal that FLIGBY can be used primarily to develop skills in dimensions such as leadership, conflict management, diplomacy and emotional intelligence. These findings are relevant for higher education institutions that intend to include and foster the development of soft skills competencies in their curricula.

Developing key competencies in sustainability through project-based learning in graduate sustainability programs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Project-based learning; Key competencies in sustainability; Curriculum; Education for sustainable development; Higher learning	HIGHER-EDUCATION; EXPERIENCE; FRAMEWORK; IMPACT; SCHOOL; AGE	Purpose This research aims to investigate the role of project-based-learning within graduate sustainability curricula through the lens of key competence development. Project-based learning has become a widely recommended pedagogy for sustainability education. It is hypothesized that through collaboration, student autonomy and real-world application, students develop key competencies for sustainability. This paper also aims to examine the connection between project-based learning and competence development on a program level from the student perspective. Design/methodology/approach This two-year comparative case study follows the project-based-learning journeys of nine graduate sustainability students from three programs: the Master's of Sustainability at Arizona State University, the Master's of Sustainability Science at Leuphana University of Luneburg and the Global Sustainability Science Master's, an ASU and Leuphana collaboration. Over four semesters, the students each took part in four competence-oriented self-assessments and interviews to map their perceived learning throughout their programs. Additional contextual information was gathered from program and course materials and descriptions, instructor interviews and in vivo observations. Findings The defining aspects of project-based learning including collaboration, student autonomy and real-world connection do contribute to students' self-perceived competence development. Student-driven and program-driven project-based learning experiences equally foster this result, as long as the pedagogical challenges of balancing support and student independence associated with each are mitigated through instructor actions, program design or individual student coping skills. Originality/value The results of this research can support higher education institutions in designing sustainability programs aimed at competence development through project-based learning. The focus on the curricular and program level combined with repeated overtime student-reported attribution to specific courses and activities bridges the gap between individual course case studies and theoretical recommendations for curriculum design. In addition to length and depth, this study also forefronts student experience of curricula as delivered.

J	Castro-Spila, J				Castro-Spila, Javier			Social Innovation Excubator Developing transformational work-based learning in the Relational University	HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING			English	Article						Social innovation; Work-based learning; Incubation-excubation; Social innovation skills	ENTREPRENEURIAL UNIVERSITY; MODEL	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a new framework for developing social innovation competencies in social sciences within the agenda of the Relational University. It explores the educational strategy promoted by the Social Innovation Excubator (SIE), an experimental social sciences lab that provides students with a work-based learning scenario focusing on the solution of social problems. Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual paper explores a new learning strategy to promote the Relational University. This exploration designs an experimental infrastructure named SIE. This infrastructure promotes the link between work-based learning and social innovation to develop four key competencies: heuristic, epistemic, relational and experimental skills. Findings - There is little attention in the literature about work-based learning and social innovation. The conceptual framework provides a program on Social Innovation Capitalization (SIC) in the framework of the SIE. This framework provides a process of four phases to prototype social innovations: exploration, experimentation, exploitation and evaluation as a process to boost social innovation skills. Research limitations/implications - The conceptual framework of Relational University is an innovative and integrative model (companies, social organizations, public sector and civil society) that develops a work-based learning strategy through SIE infrastructure. The SIE has a strong implication for social sciences developing an experimental space to explore, exploit and evaluate local social problems. Practical implications - The SIE infrastructure and the SIC program promotes a new strategy in social sciences to boost employability (new competencies), entrepreneurship (pilot social organizations) and intra-entrepreneurship (social innovation in organizations). Originality/value - This paper proposes a conceptual and empirical framework to develop the Relational University through a new learning strategy linking work-based learning and social innovation. This practical framework covers a lack in the work-based learning perspective opening a new line of research linked to social innovation.

It is emphasized that the need to prepare students with twenty-firstcentury skills through STEM-related teaching is strong, especially at the elementary level. The authors present selected previous experiences, publications, research into the study topic, and review examples of primary school robotics and programming curricula, as well as associated educational activities. The authors stress that workshops, using kits to build and programme robots, are a modern form of interdisciplinary education of children and youth. Design/methodology/approach - The rationale for conducting such activities in schools is found in the European reference framework in the context of training of key competences. Classes in robotics - if properly taught - will have an impact on the development of mathematical literacy and scientific-technical information and social competences. At the same time, competence is understood to mean a combination of knowledge, skills and attitudes appropriate to the situation. Besides, an analysis is presented of basic legal regulations in this matter as well as results of a survey, conducted in Poland and Ukraine among in-service teachers and prospective teachers. Findings - The study was carried out with the participation of 91 primary school teachers and future teachers in the province of Silesia and at the University of Silesia in Poland, and in Ukraine, at Borys Grinchenko Kyiv University. The survey contained 15 questions about the pedagogical research "Robotics and children". The study was carried out to determine the needs of modern education to introduce the basics of robotics in the educational process of primary school. Originality/value - It can be expected that the findings from the prior Polish and Ukrainian surveys can be extrapolated into curricula for secondary schools and vocational education and training (VET) in the coming years.

J	Lambrechts, W; Verhulst, E; Rymenams, S				Lambrechts, Wim; Verhulst, Elli; Rymenams, Sara			Professional development of sustainability competences in higher education The role of empowerment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Higher education; Professional development; Empowerment; Sustainable development; Competences; Human factors	KEY COMPETENCES; UNIVERSITIES; INTEGRATION; MANAGEMENT; TEAM	Purpose - This paper aims to provide insights into the relation between professional development (PD) and organisational change processes towards sustainability, with a specific focus on empowerment. Design/methodology/approach - The paper builds upon a constructivist approach, combining a literature review, a desk research on key publications and reports and a socio-political analysis to reveal the specific context in Flanders, Belgium. Findings are then connected to earlier insights from research on organisational change for sustainability. Findings - The paper provides a number of PD initiatives that focus on sustainability in general and in a single higher education (HE) institution. Framing such initiatives as an organisational change process offers insights on how elements of empowerment are currently incorporated in PD initiatives and how it can strengthen them to lead to the further integration of sustainability competences in HE. Research limitations/implications - Limitations are linked with the kind of sources used in the constructivist approach. The analysis only looks at written reports on the topic, albeit it also builds upon the first-hand experiences of educators in the HE institution focused upon in the case. Practical implications - There is a need to frame PD initiatives as an organisational change process towards sustainability with specific attention towards empowerment. Without this framing, PD approaches comprise the risk of being left in the margins or being understood as single initiatives without any connection to the bigger picture, i.e. the transition towards sustainability in HE. Social implications - Interlinking PD and organisational change provides opportunities to frame the sustainability transition within the university in a wider societal context. Originality/value - The paper provides an original contribution to the debate on sustainability competences, as it frames the PD within an organisational context, rather than focusing on the individual role of educators.

J	Sahin, E; Alici, S				Sahin, Elvan; Alici, Sule			An associational study on pre-service early childhood teachers' nature relatedness in education for sustainability	INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH IN GEOGRAPHICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Associational study; early childhood education; education for sustainability; nature relatedness; Pre-service teachers	CONNECTION; SCALE	There is significant global concern with current environmental problems, yet people's behaviour towards the environment has been resistant to change. Young people have the opportunity to bring about desirable changes through environmental behaviours and attitudes. The goal of this study is to better understand the scope of nature relatedness as an attribution interacting with pro-environmental behaviours for Turkish pre-service early childhood teachers. We examined the associations between the domains representing nature relatedness and also sought to identify any differences in nature relatedness with respect to their year of enrolment in a teacher education program. The participants were 402 students attending an Early Childhood Teacher Education Program at one of the two public universities in the capital of Turkey. A Turkish-adapted version of the Nature Relatedness Scale developed by Nisbet, Zelenski, and Murphy was administered to gather the data. Participants were found to have a mostly positive external nature-related worldview. Furthermore, the statistical analysis indicated non-significant differences in their nature relatedness with respect to the year of enrolment in the teacher education program. In terms of the relationships between the constructs representing nature relatedness, the internalized identification with nature was positively correlated with two constructs which refer to his/her physical familiarity as well as attraction to nature, and how individual's relationship with the environment is provoked by his/her behaviour. This research indicates that pre-service teachers, who are regarded as important agents for the future implementation of sustainability education, are actually lacking in their nature relatedness constructs and need to develop key competencies in a field that presupposes that they have already acquired sufficient experience of physical and emotional interaction with nature.

J	Pavlicevic-Franic, D				Pavlicevic-Franic, Dunja			The Impact of Listening and Speaking Language Skills on the Development of Communicative Competence	CROATIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION-HRVATSKI CASOPIS ZA ODGOJ I OBRAZOVANJE			English	Article						communicative competence; linguistic competence; listening and speaking language skills		The aim of the Croatian language teaching in elementary school is to enable students to develop language communicative competence which would allow them to successfully acquire the curriculum, and to be functionally included in the lifelong learning process (NPiP, 2006). Since the process of language acquisition does not only include acquiring linguistic and communicative elements but also developing psychosocial skills, L1 communication is emphasized as the first and most important out of eight key competences in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Vijece Europe, 2005). Therefore, all the participants within the educational process are expected to encourage the development of language competences - firstly communicative and then linguistic competence. A child enters the language communication process by means of listening and imitating adult speakers of a language community, after which the processes of repetition and understanding, and the act of speaking are triggered. After finishing preschool, school-age children develop more complex language skills such as reading and writing. However, the basic skills of listening and speaking should still not be neglected. Unfortunately, the teaching experience and scientific research (Aladrovio-Slovaek, 2011; Cvikic, Pavlicevic-Franic, & Aladrovic-Slovacek, 2015; Jelaska, 2005; Pavlicevic-Franic, 2005, 2011) point to the fact that it is precisely the basic language skills of listening and speaking that are not being sufficiently included in the teaching process. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to articulate the immense importance of the receptive skill of listening and the productive skill of speaking within the process of learning and teaching Croatian, since they are the basic linguistic skills necessary both for acquiring the Croatian language and other school subjects.

J	VanWynsberghe, R				VanWynsberghe, Rob			Education for Sustainability, Transformational Learning Time and the Individual Collective Dialectic	FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION			English	Article						transformational learning; education for sustainability; individual and collective; case study	KEY COMPETENCES; PROGRAMS	In the interest of developing sustainability practitioners, this manuscript challenges the conceptualization of transformative learning for Education for Sustainability (EfS) in relation to single courses or programs. Conversely, I will argue that becoming a sustainability practitioner (i.e., someone who takes action in the interest of the sustainability movement) is life-long and life-wide commitment. Time and how and why it matters is addressed. To develop this point, this manuscript details a case study of an education for sustainability graduate program that I designed and currently lead. The purpose is to further theorize transformative learning as it links individual action(s) and collective change(s) in the border-like but permeable spaces that are in-between. It asks the practical question of the ways educators (and practitioners) might expansively and generatively work together in creating a lifetime of classrooms to continuously bridge individual action and collective change.

J	Wan, YL; Bi, HL				Wan, Yanlan; Bi, Hualin			What Major "Socio-Scientific Topics" Should the Science Curriculum Focused on? A Delphi Study of the Expert Community in China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION			English	Article						Delphi method; Frontiers of science; Science curriculum; Socio-scientific issues; Socio-scientific topics	SOCIOSCIENTIFIC ISSUES	Science and technology play an important role in the development of human society. Thus, science education should reflect the trend of social development and prepare students to think about and make wise decisions on major social topics related to science. As an aspect of the societal dimension of science, socio-scientific topics (SSTs) have a great influence on social development. In order to prepare students to participate in modern social life effectively, shape the society in a sustainable way, and become responsible citizens in the future, what major SSTs should science curriculum relevant to students and the society focus on? In this study, the famous forecasting method, the Delphi method, was used to explore the above-mentioned question. Thirty-three experts who came from Chinese universities and scientific research institutes were invited to make effective decisions based on the backgrounds of social development and students' all-round development demands during a three-stage Delphi process. The results showed that six level-one SSTs that referred to the generalized and superior socio-scientific fields and thirty corresponding level-two SSTs that referred to their specific and inferior topics achieved consensus and should be emphasized in the science curriculum. The six level-one SSTs are "environmental issues," "safety and health," "resources and energy," "ecological system," "biotechnology," and "new materials." It is believed that the conclusion is helpful to promote the development of students' key competencies and can provide advice and enlightenment for science curriculum reform all over the world.

J	Lambrechts, W; Van Petegem, P				Lambrechts, Wim; Van Petegem, Peter			The interrelations between competences for sustainable development and research competences	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Higher education; Education for sustainable development; Information literacy; Competences for sustainable development; Research competences	HIGHER-EDUCATION; POLICY DEVELOPMENT; KEY COMPETENCES; INTEGRATION; SUPPORT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how competences for sustainable development and research interrelate within a context of competence-based higher education. Specific focus is oriented towards strengthening research competences for sustainability. Design/methodology/approach - Following a hermeneutic-interpretive methodology, this paper builds upon a critical literature review to demarcate the theoretical framework and an in-depth analysis of a case study exploring the interrelations between both types of competences. Findings - The paper discusses current issues in the integration of competences and explores the contribution of research-based methods to acquire competences for sustainable development. The analysis shows that research skills are often mentioned to contribute to this acquisition, though from a general perspective, or from the sidelines of the learning process. A holistic view on how both concepts are linked is missing. Research limitations/implications - First, the complex nature of competences and their integration in higher education could lead to difficulties in interpreting and analysing them. Second, the analysis is based on a single-case study, limiting possibilities to generalise the results. Third, this study is not looking at curriculum practices in these fields. Practical implications - There is a need to holistically (re-) frame research competences within the concepts of education for sustainable development and, to a wider extent, sustainable development. Social implications - Framing research competences within the concept of sustainable development enables a thorough and "conscious", rather than coincidental, acquisition of competences for sustainable development. Originality/value - The originality of this paper lies in the fact that there is little literature about the interrelations between competences for sustainable development and research competences.

J	Moon, YL				Moon, Yong-Lin			Education reform and competency-based education	ASIA PACIFIC EDUCATION REVIEW			English	Article						education reform; manpower-centered education; competency-based education		The core purpose of this paper is to describe a new educational paradigm as well as possible directions and tasks for education reform in the 2152 century. The present-day education system has failed to nurture the kind of creative people who can play leading roles in development or to produce citizens of a good character and democratic tendencies. We need to look at education from the standpoint of expanding the totality of possibilities for national development. The current educational system of Korea can be characterized as one of "manpower-centered education." In this system, education functions to produce the human resources needed by the nation, and there is a strong belief in the classification and selection of high-quality human capital via the school system. We can think of an educational model that is parallel to the current system of manpower classification and selection and call it "competency-based education." In this model, the identification of individual ability, talent, and aptitude is deemed to be the most important, and the key task of education is self-actualization through recognition and cultivation of such talents and abilities. What educational values should be pursued within a new competency-based paradigm? First, we can reduce the relative weight of subject-centered education and introduce a competency-based curriculum in order to teach key competences for life. Second, new intelligence theories must be introduced into education in order to foster the development of students' talents, aptitudes, and potentials. Third, we can make use of positive psychology, which is a newly emerging field, the core concept of which is the belief that happiness in life depends on one's ability to develop and maintain positive feelings and emotions.

J	Falloon, G				Falloon, Garry			Using avatars and virtual environments in learning: What do they have to offer?	BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								This paper explores and discusses arguments for the use of virtual environments and interactive avatars in supporting the achievement of student learning goals within conventional educational contexts. It describes and evaluates arguments promoted by some authors (eg, van den Brekel, 2007; Deuchar & Nodder, 2003; Dickey, 2003; Facer, 2004; de Freitas, 2006; de Freitas & Oliver, 2006; Garris, Ahlers & Driskell, 2002; JISC, 2007; Martino, 2007; Prensky, 2004; Prensky, 2007) relating to advantages from gaming and avatar use, ranging from enhanced engagement in learning activities, through to more purposeful and focussed communication, and, when used in group situations, better cooperation and collaboration between students. It explores the potential of avatar environments to act as powerful communication mediums for students to display knowledge and understanding, and engage in the development of 'higher order thinking skills, such as interpreting, analysing, evaluating, synthesising and solving complex problems'. It also introduces and discusses the avatar-based authoring program MARVIN, and identifies potential for its use as a digital storytelling tool to assist students in communicating outcomes from units of learning, and in supporting the development of a range of key learning competencies identified in the New Zealand Curriculum Framework (Ministry of Education, 2007). It profiles a successful example of the classroom-based use of MARVIN within a community project undertaken by groups of year 7 and 8 students at two Hamilton intermediate schools, and identifies how the program supported student thinking and relating to others key competencies (Ministry of Education, 2007).

Public health professionals will need to be trained to respond to this challenge. The aim of this comparative study among Poland, the UK and the Netherlands is to identify competence needs for Master of Public Health graduates entering the labour market from a European perspective. A self-administered questionnaire was sent to employers in the three countries, rating the importance of competency in public health on a master's level. In all three countries, interpersonal competencies, like team working and communication skills, are rated as highly important. However, employers in the UK and Poland generally rate public health specific competencies as much more important than their Dutch colleagues. It is concluded that while public health specific knowledge is providing a useful starting point for entry-level public health professionals, employers increasingly recognise the value of generic competencies such as communication and team working skills. The results suggest a stronger emphasis on teaching methods that encourage active learning and the integration of skills, which is crucial for enhancing graduates' employability, and foster an open attitude to multidisciplinary working, which is essential in modern health care.

The purpose of this study is to identify essential components of TL within an international sustainability leadership master's program in Sweden that has been described by many students as life-changing, empowering and transformational. Design/methodology/approach Alumni spanning 15 cohorts provided answers to a survey and the responses were used to map components of TL as experienced by the students. Findings The survey confirms the anecdotal assertions that the program is transformational. The findings suggest that community, place, pedagogy, concepts and content, disorientation and hope and agency are essential components, combined with the synergy of those into an integrated whole that support transformational change according to many respondents.

J	Song, MR				Song, Miran			Integrated STEM teaching competencies and performances as perceived by secondary teachers in South Korea	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Exploratory factor analysis; Teaching competencies; Secondary teachers; Integrated STEM; Importance-performance analysis	EDUCATION; SCIENCE; MATHEMATICS; VALIDATION	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore what key competencies and characteristics of teachers are needed for integrated Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) teaching and to investigate teachers' perceptions on how important those competencies are and how often they are executed. Design/methodology/approach An exploratory sequential mixed methods approach was used to investigate key characteristics of integrated STEM teaching competencies and the level of their importance and performance as perceived by teachers. By using behavioral event interview technique, qualitative data were collected from professional secondary teachers in science, math and technology subjects. An instrument was constructed based on the result of qualitative research; and a survey was conducted with 48 STEM teachers working in South Korea. The mean values between importance and performance of integrated STEM teaching competencies were compared. A perceived importance level of each item was compared with a practice level by using importance-performance analysis. Findings As a result of qualitative research, in total 21 items were constructed as detailed characteristics of each domain of integrated STEM teaching competencies, which provide insights about teachers' perceptions of teaching competencies that are critical for integrated STEM education. A comparison of means between importance and performance of integrated STEM teaching competencies showed that whereas teachers considered each of these items to be of significant importance in their overall evaluation of the integrated STEM teaching competencies, they are not performing at a level that reflects the assigned importance. Originality/value South Korea has focused on integrated STEM education to raise talented human resources in the fields of science and technology. However, many teachers have experienced serious difficulties and troubles in executing integrated STEM education. It is necessary to figure out key competencies and characteristics of teachers to facilitate integrated STEM teaching.

J	Karwinska, A				Karwinska, Anna			Challenges for socialization in contemporary Poland. The role of children's universities	E-MENTOR			English	Article						civil society; integration values; economic competences; civil competences; socialization processes; the children's university		For three decades, Polish society has been confronted with new expectations and challenges related to the transformation of virtually all areas of life. It has to deal with many problems, as well as with the necessity to acquire new competences, skills, and knowledge in various fields. In this article, the author has identified several key challenges. They refer especially to obtaining capabilities needed for active participation in the market economy and civil society. Social values enabling integration are of key importance among them. According to research cited in the paper, Polish society has insufficient knowledge and competences in these fields. Simultaneously, they are very desirable in the process of modernization of Poland's economy. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the socialization processes, both formal and non-formal, are adequate to the needs and expectations of the society. It is difficult to overestimate the value of the opportunity to explore freely, to ask questions, and to be allowed to find a solution to a given problem because such experiences support the development of key competences indispensable for proper functioning in the modern, dynamically changing world. In this article, the author points out a vital role of non-formal institutions, particularly the children's universities, which are more flexible and may have an impact on creating the concept of the future more personalized education.

J	Crujeiras, B; Jimenez-Aleixandre, MP				Crujeiras, Beatriz; Pilar Jimenez-Aleixandre, Maria			Challenges in the implementation of a competency-based curriculum in Spain	THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY			English	Article						Scientific competency; Epistemic practices; Higher-order thinking; Policy		This paper addresses some of the challenges involved in implementing the new approach established in the Spanish National Curriculum in 2006, which brought as a major change a focus on the development of key competencies. The paper focuses on scientific competency and the challenges involved in the itinerary from policy documents to classrooms are addressed in three sections: (i) an analysis is made of the changes in the science curriculum as a consequence of the emphasis on scientific competency, comparing the assessment criteria in the previous and current steering documents; (ii) trends in teacher education are discussed; (iii) the findings of the diagnostic evaluation are analyzed. The paper is framed in a theoretical approach, viewing students' participation in scientific practices, and the development of higher-order thinking as necessary goals of science education. We argue that the focus on competencies, characterized as the ability to apply knowledge and skills in new contexts, involves a major change towards knowledge transfer and higher-order thinking skills. Some issues emerging from the analysis relate to the implications of assessment criteria and the challenges involved in its implementation, to the trends in teacher professional development and the difficulties related to the current economic crisis and to the results of the diagnostic evaluation and time frame needed for reforms to have an impact. It is argued that the development of both competencies and higher-order thinking requires students' prolonged engagement. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Guitert, M; Romeu, T; Colas, JF				Guitert, Montse; Romeu, Teresa; Colas, Jean-Francois			Basic digital competences for unemployed citizens: conceptual framework and training model	COGENT EDUCATION			English	Article						basic digital competences; digital job seeking; employability; conceptual framework; training model		Digital competence is a transversal key competence increasingly required by the labour market as well as by the job search process itself, most of which has now shifted online. Individuals who have not developed the most basic digital technology skills are most at risk for long-term unemployment. We argue that to bridge the skills gap of digitally-excluded, unemployed citizens we should create a common understanding of what are the most essential digital competences they require, in particular, to solve their job seeking problems. The resulting conceptual framework should aim to facilitate the design of an elementary but comprehensive practical learning programme through which adult learners can readily develop self-efficacy using digital technologies. To fulfil this need, we provide a holistic framework within which ten essential digital competences for unemployed citizens are identified and contextualised. It is grounded on an analysis of generic digital competence frameworks and existing employability-enhancing digital training initiatives. The applicability of this new "basic digital competences" framework was tested using an iterative process of evaluation with practitioners involved in programmes for the unemployed, and through the design of a challenge-based learning project that provides a practical training model for the implementation of the framework in an integrated and transversal manner.

REVISTA DE EDUCACION			English	Article						curriculum; pedagogy; awareness; death; finitude; documentary research	EDUCATION	This article presents a diagnostic research study on the inclusion of death awareness in the Spanish curriculum. Its documentary analysis methodology examines legislation on the Spanish education system and its curricular development at the state level as contexts of analysis. Analysis of the presence of death awareness in the curriculum is based on 25 units: terms and lexical roots selected by 17 experts. Quantitative techniques were used to analyse their frequency in the current laws on education and the curriculum at different education levels (Pre-school, Primary, Compulsory Secondary and High School), areas of knowledge and subjects, where appropriate. The qualitative analysis interprets the presence of each term, according to the inclusion death awareness in education. The results allow for identifying the presence of curricular elements that are comparable to the Pedagogy of Death in all education levels and in areas of knowledge such as Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts, though not in a planned manner, that is, with the intention of educating in death awareness. Likewise, its absence is observed in the aims and principles of Education or in key competences. The map resulting of the study allows for concluding the existence of educational gaps and challenges that must be addressed by including death awareness as an essential element of education.

J	Milana, M				Milana, Marcella			Adult Education for Democratic Citizenship in Europe	CADMO			English	Article						lifelong learning; democratic citizenship; adult education; European Commission; civic competence		In 2001 a new emphasis on learning for democratic citizenship has been championed by the European Commission's Communication on Making a European area of lifelong learning a reality. The communication recognizes active citizenship as one of the four "broad and mutually supporting objectives" of the lifelong learning strategy. Accordingly, civic competence, which "equips individuals to fully participate in civic life", has been identified by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union as a key competence to be given priority in all member states in the years to come. The article introduces the core principles of a European study aiming at investigating, from a comparative perspective, ways in which adults can achieve competencies relevant for democratic citizenship. Furthermore it presents and discusses selected of findings. The findings suggest that, in spite of the shift from education to learning for democratic citizenship within the European discourse, the emphasis on lifelong learning and the consequent equal recognition of in-school and out-of-school learning activities, most empirical research in the field of education for democratic citizenship remains primarily concerned with school-aged pupils. When available, research which focuses on the links between adult education and learning for democratic citizenship is highly theoretical and rarely supported by empirical evidence.

The case study is based on output materials produced during the lifetime of the Tuning Russia project involving a number of Russian universities, one of which is the Russian State University for the Humanities (RSUH). The module in question - the LSP (language for special purposes) translation module - emphasizes interaction between the related disciplines on the basis of the common subject-matter, i.e. the translation of special purpose texts. The modular approach sets out to achieve key competences required for professional qualifications. In addition, the module considers teaching methods, ECTS and assessment tools. Attention is given to the concept of competence-based approach in contemporary education. The authors argue that the competence-based approach introduced in Russia at the national (Ministerial) level in 2016 facilitates Russia's interactive alignment with the main principles of the Bologna Process adopted by the European Higher Education Area.

J	Chan, SJ; Lin, JW				Chan, Sheng-Ju; Lin, Jing-Wen			Aiming for better employment: a holistic analysis from admission to labour market	JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Educational mismatch; employability; key competencies; skill formation	EDUCATIONAL MISMATCHES; SKILL MISMATCHES; TAIWAN; SEARCH	To address the changing needs of the labour market better, higher education institutions have increasingly aimed to enhance their teaching quality and the learning experiences of their students. Therefore, a key concept of the missions of contemporary educational institutions is to improve students' employability after graduation. Although extensive initiatives have been undertaken, educational mismatch remains intensely debated and may seriously challenge the greater use of limited human resources in Taiwan. In this study, a vocational-oriented department (baking) of a local well-known university was chosen for a case study. A holistic approach from student admission to entry in the labour market is adopted to analyse student learning, teaching, curriculum planning, and structural and enterprise demands to estimate the extent to which these graduates fit the requirement of employers. Research findings indicate multiple gaps in skill formation, intended labour needs, and career ladders. These gaps bring profound implications to questions about strengthening the linkage or transitioning from higher education to the labour market.

This article analyses the impact of an intercultural learning intervention in a Spanish university post-European Higher Education Area implementation. Objective. Our research's main objective consisted of measuring the development of intercultural competence in the first cohort of a Translation and Intercultural Communication bachelor's degree in a Spanish university, before and after taking specific courses in intercultural studies and spending a study abroad semester. Methodology. A mixed methodology was implemented, in which the Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) was used as a measuring instrument. Additionally, in-depth personal interviews were conducted to complement the data obtained. Results. The results of this study show that the programming and sequencing of specific courses, together with experiences abroad, contribute to the development of intercultural competence. Conclusions. More intercultural learning interventions are needed in higher education courses to develop and build an intercultural campus and educate global citizens. When applying intercultural learning interventions and intercultural methodologies, students develop their intercultural competence, a key competence for 21st-century graduates.

Among non-cognitive factors hindering the acquisition of these competencies are negative attitudes towards Statistics. This study analyzes attitudes towards Statistics among tourism students enrolled on their first Statistics course, paying special attention to its evolution from the beginning to the end of the course. Positive attitudes are a desirable course result, and its development needs to be assessed. An exploratory factor analysis performed on the SATS-28 (c) items reveals the existence of three main components of students' attitudes towards Statistics: Anxiety, Affect & Self-confidence, and Value. At the end of the course, only the Anxiety dimension improved its score. Since there is an absolute lack of research on tourism students' attitudes towards Statistics, it would be advisable to carry out further research, extending the preliminary methodology presented in this research to other courses, universities, and countries.

They also develop a model of the factors for which they presume most significantly contribute to the development of the selected competencies. For the selection of competencies and predictors of their development they adapted the model of the REFLEX Project (2009-) in-line with relevant theories, projects and authors concerning the competencies of primary school teachers. In the empirical part, the authors, among others, prove as follows: (1) the grades of the future primary school teachers during study have only a very limited impact on the acquired competencies studied in the paper; (2) occupational values highly impact the development of all studied competencies; (3) greater inclusiveness of an individual in social networks has a positive impact and statistically significantly contributes to reaching all studied competencies. The authors agree that the future development of the curriculum for primary school teachers should seriously consider these findings.

Consequently, such institutions need to incorporate sustainability into their activities. However, this needs to be done holistically and not with isolated and independent actions. Therefore, this study aims to develop a structure of sustainability action archetypes to help HEIs holistically incorporate sustainability in their strategies. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of the literature was conducted focusing on the subject of sustainability in HEIs. Findings A structure of sustainability action archetypes for HEIs was proposed. Further, based on scientific literature, examples of actions were presented within each archetype. Practical implications This study provides HEI administrators and other organizations with a practical structure to enable the systemic incorporation of sustainability objectives and actions into institutional activities. Originality/value This study adapts the tool "sustainable business model archetypes" for a new purpose. This tool was initially developed to classify innovations of sustainable business models.

Systems modelling and the development of coherent understanding of cell biology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION			English	Article							STUDENTS; EDUCATION	This article reports on educational design research concerning a learning and teaching strategy for cell biology in upper-secondary education introducing systems modelling as a key competence. The strategy consists of four modelling phases in which students subsequently develop models of free-living cells, a general two-dimensional model of cells, a three-dimensional model of plant cells, and finally they are engaged in formal thinking by modelling life phenomena to a hierarchical systems model. The strategy was thought out, elaborated, and tested in classrooms in several research cycles. Throughout the field-tests, research data were collected by means of classroom observations, interviews, audio-taped discussions, completed worksheets, written tests, and questionnaires. Reflection on the research findings eventuated in reshaping and formalizing the learning and teaching strategy, which is presented here. The results show that although acquiring systems thinking competence at the metacognitive level needs more effort, our strategy contributed to improving learning outcomes; that is, acquisition of a coherent conceptual understanding of cell biology and acquisition of initial systems thinking competence, with modelling being the key activity.

The authors conclude, based on an analysis of earlier research as well as their own study, that educational robots can stimulate learners' learning motivation. Compared with other media, programmable bricks provide children with the opportunity to create their own products and, through this process, to express creative thinking. Studies have found that learning robotics or integrating programming bricks into courses can help to develop students' problem-solving abilities and enhance their learning performance. Besides, an analysis is presented of basic legal regulations in this matter, primary school curricula as well as some results of a survey conducted in Poland and Ukraine among in-service teachers and prospective teachers.

J	Olalla, CB; Merino, A				Benito Olalla, Consuelo; Merino, Amparo			Competences for sustainability in undergraduate business studies: A content analysis of value-based course syllabi in Spanish universities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION			English	Article						Business education; Business ethics; Corporate social responsibility; Sustainability; Competences for sustainability; Spanish universities	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; MANAGEMENT EDUCATION; LEARNING OUTCOMES; KEY COMPETENCES; ETHICS; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; KNOWLEDGE; PEDAGOGY; SCHOOLS; PRME	The sustainability challenges that our societies are facing involve the debate about the role that higher education institutions play in enabling learners with the necessary abilities to deal with those challenges. The field of management education is particularly controversial, as business organizations are considered to be a fundamental part of the solution to the sustainability crises, but also a major cause. This study aims to contribute to that conversation within the Spanish context by providing a general overview of the competences that are developed in business undergraduate degrees in the Spanish universities and business schools. For that purpose, an exploratory content analysis of syllabi is performed, considering all the existing courses related to ethics, social responsibility and sustainability. The content analysis is based on the theoretical frameworks of competences for sustainability and transformative learning. Specifically, we aim to respond the question about the extent to which competences are oriented to facilitate students the possibility to question their frames of references. Our findings reveal that competences focused on acquisition on knowledge and performance in the workplace are dominant, leaving a wide space for implementing transformative learning approaches.

BLENDING PEDAGOGY AND DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY TO TRANSFORM EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE RESEARCH IN SCIENCE ENGINEERING AND EDUCATION-IJCRSEE			English	Article						digital education; educational environment; competence-oriented approach; digital education technology; tutor's technology		This article shows efficacy of competences-oriented education model, representing effectiveness of pedagogy technology and digital tools blending in transforming education while using tutor's support. In correspondence to contemporary requirements and education system special features, connection between digital education tools and tutor technology contributing to students' key competences development is determined. The paper contributes to the field by summarizing some theoretical issues and offering implementation suggestions for effectively integrating digital technologies into teaching and learning. The use of digital technologies in educational activities opens up new opportunities, adequate methods for dissemination and management of digital information, development of necessary competencies on the basis of digital literacy, ensuring equitable access for all who wish to obtain necessary knowledge and decision-making skills, ensuring demand for school graduates in the world labor market in situation of digital economy. Innovative technologies become a problem adding difficulties to students' burden. Tutor becomes an intermediary between students and digital technologies to promote students' active learning practices; there are not so many students who can appreciate digital learning practices and get the most of it. The role of tutoring in digital literacy promotion is hard to overestimate. Tutor support is a pedagogical activity in individualization of education aimed at identifying and developing students' educational motives and interests. To form students' key competencies in education system, it is necessary to supplement traditional education with tools of digital educational technologies, new trends in pedagogies such as tutoring, which is becoming an integral part of modern learning process.

J	Kater-Wettstadt, L				Kater-Wettstaedt, Lydia			How secondary-school students deal with issues of sustainable development in class(*)	ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH			English	Article						Education for sustainable development; classroom research; student strategies; Documentary Method	ENVIRONMENTAL-EDUCATION; MEANING-MAKING; VALUES; DISCOURSES; CLASSROOM; PROJECTS	Education for sustainable development (ESD) is intended to enable individuals to shape a fair and sustainable society. Implemented at schools, ESD addresses specific topics, e.g. globalization or pollutants in clothing. This study investigates what challenges are connected with such issues in class and how students deal with issues of sustainable development at German secondary schools. Several teaching units in different subjects and schools were video- and audiotaped. The empirical material was analysed using the Documentary Method (a qualitative reconstructive approach) to describe students' competences that emerged within different pedagogical arrangements. We identified three key competences that provide important skills for handling issues in ESD that deal (1) with the state of not knowing, (2) with perspectivity, and (3) with calls to action.

A perspective from Iran	PERSPECTIVES IN EDUCATION			English	Article						competency; agricultural education; agricultural graduates; communication; factor analysis	HIGH-SCHOOL; SKILLS; TRANSITION; WORK	A high level of personal-capacity, the relevant professional competence and technical skills are essential for a graduate's successful transition to the workplace. The purpose of this survey was to identify the main competencies that higher agricultural education graduates should possess, based on the perceptions of potential agricultural employers. The population of this study comprised public, private, and cooperative managers and employers in the agricultural sector in the provinces of Mazandaran, Khuzestan, Kermanshah and Hamedan (N=485). A sample of 212 employers was selected using a stratified random sampling method. A four-part instrument in the form of a questionnaire was developed by the researchers to gather the required data. Factor analysis was used to elicit the preferences of employers for key competencies. The results show that employers value generic competencies relatively higher than field-specific competencies for agricultural graduates entering the agricultural field The generic competencies identified include communication skills, problem-solving ability, agricultural ethics, business and computer skills, and general administrative skills and abilities, such as leadership and team-work. Technical skills and agricultural professionalism were identified as field-specific competencies. To develop these competencies, a new didactical arrangement, including supervised agricultural experience programmes, experiential learning, and fundamental changes in the teaching and learning process are proposed.

A case study with secondary school teachers involved in a training programme focusing on context-based approach	RESEARCH IN SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						Science curriculum reforms; context-based teaching; teachers' response; teachers' reflection	PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; CURRICULUM; IDENTITY	Background Numerous investigations have highlighted the importance of examining teachers' responses to the curricular reforms in science teaching proposed by the educational authorities. Science teachers' responses are shaped by their perceptions of the new measures' intentions and their level of involvement. Purpose This study analyses the evolution of the teachers ' beliefs and opinions to externally driven curriculum reform in Spain focused on developing key competences. Sample Four secondary science teachers participated in a training programme in which a context-based approach to teaching scientific competences was implemented. Design and methods The data analysis applied a scheme that differentiates the personal, internal and external focus of teachers' work. It also introduced the qualifier concept, whether their responses were seen as facilitating (F) or obstacles (O) the development of competence-based science education. The data was obtained from different settings: two individual interviews with each teacher and a focus group carried out with the four teachers Results The teachers' perceptions cover many aspects (20), which have all been categorized into the 27 factors included in the scheme used. The teachers' perceptions were mainly on the personal focus at all training programme settings. However, their responses also reflected factors related to the internal and external focuses, though to a lesser extent. Conclusion The study ' s findings show the influence of reflection on the teachers' observations and impressions, helping them elicit many factors according to Ryder ' s proposal. As for the qualifiers expressed by the teachers, the evaluations depended on the teacher profile and the settings used. These considerations highlight the influence of training and experiential knowledge on professional development.

Therefore, what core teaching competencies do science teachers need to have in their practice? This study uses fuzzy Delphi technique and Analytic Hierarchy Process to approach the above problems. Experts from Chinese universities, secondary schools and educational research institutions were invited to participate in two rounds of Delphi process. The research results show that the four domains of core teaching competencies of science teachers and their 21 competencies have high content validity. Additionally, it can be concluded that the weights of core competencies of making learning objectives, raising pedagogical questions, stimulating learning motivation and analyzing course content ranked high, while the weights of core competencies of using information technology and multimedia, evaluating practical work, and presenting research results have received less attention. It is believed that the results of this study can enlighten the education reform of science teachers and promote the professional development of pre-service/in-service science teachers.

J	Ritzhaupt, AD; Martin, F				Ritzhaupt, Albert D.; Martin, Florence			Development and validation of the educational technologist multimedia competency survey	ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Multimedia competencies; Educational technologist; Instructional designer; Competencies	MANAGEMENT	The purpose of this research study was to identify the multimedia competencies of an educational technologist by creating a valid and reliable survey instrument to administer to educational technology professionals. The educational technology multimedia competency survey developed through this research is based on a conceptual framework that emphasizes the current definition of the field. Following the conceptual framework, a review of literature and an emergent theme analysis on 205 job announcements in educational technology were conducted. Eighty-five multimedia competencies were derived from this analysis and organized into knowledge, skill, and ability statements. These data were examined using descriptive statistics, internal consistency reliability, exploratory factor analysis, and multivariate analysis of variance. Though the purpose of the instrument was to measure multimedia competencies relevant to the field of educational technology, other constructs on the instrument emerged as more important in the analysis. The results include key competencies, such as knowledge of methods and theories of instruction; soft skills; and the ability to work in a team-oriented environment. A discussion about the results is provided. The instrument was found to have a valid and internally consistent structure.

The QELtLCUS questionnaire. An instrument for evaluating the learning to learn competence in university students	RELIEVE-REVISTA ELECTRONICA DE INVESTIGACION Y EVALUACION EDUCATIVA			English	Article						Learning to learn competence; Assessment; University students; Self-regulated learning		Learning to learn is one of the key competences identified by the European Commission (EC, 2005 and 2006) for education systems. Rigorous evaluation instruments are necessary for this competence to be included in curriculum design and teaching-learning processes. Currently available questionnaires are limited and so the present work focuses on the design and validation of a standardised quantitative questionnaire to evaluate the way in which university students manage this competence. A test validation design was employed with a sample of 1237 university students from three universities in Valencia. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed good internal consistency and construct validity outcomes. A final questionnaire was produced which addressed five dimensions/scales (cognitive, metacognitive, affective-motivational, social-relational and ethical) through twenty-one subdimensions/subscales composed of 85 items. This questionnaire was found to be more robust and comprehensive than those that were previously available. The instrument will help to advance knowledge in this area. It is useful for researchers as it can be used for diagnosing and evaluating the competence in question, whilst also comparing results obtained in large population samples.

The rubric has an online format and digital access through a learning management system aimed at schools. After completing it, teachers receive a personalized report on their competence profile. The reliability results show acceptable indices of internal consistency and empirical validation through the Multidimensional Non-Metre Scaling (PROXSCAL) procedure, suggesting that the rubric is an effective tool to evaluate teaching skills in non-university teaching. The use of this tool offers real opportunities for self-improvement and reflection amongst teachers related to their competencies and how to plan their professional development.

A competency-based professional roles model for early career engineers, validated in industry and higher education	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						Competence; professional skills; engineering profession; mixed methods research		This study contributes to the current research in career and professional identity development in that it developed a validated competency-based framework to enhance professional and self-awareness of future engineers. Through a mixed-method design, key competencies were identified for three professional roles for early career engineers. Ninety-six engineers and HR experts from different fields were involved. This resulted in three portraits of early career engineers in practice (engineers in a role focusing on radical innovation, on process optimisation and/or on customised solutions) and what it requires to be successful in these roles. For example, perseverance and creativity were deemed essential for engineers in an innovative role, whereas positive critical attitude and stress resistance were indicated essential for engineers focusing on optimisation. The competency profiles with an aspiration to career perspectives can be a valuable instrument in creating more diversity in engineering.

J	Duffy, J; Montgomery, L; Murphy, P; Davidson, G; Bunting, L				Duffy, Joe; Montgomery, Lorna; Murphy, Paul; Davidson, Gavin; Bunting, Lisa			Differing knowledges: comparing the contribution of drama students and service users in role-plays preparing social work students for practice	SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION			English	Article						Service user involvement; simulation; drama students; social work education; experiential knowledge	EDUCATION; INVOLVEMENT; EXPERIENCE; ACADEMICS; CONFLICT; EXPERT	Much has been written about service user involvement in social work education with the literature recognizing the value of this particular type of experiential knowledge in helping students understand key competences and concepts. There is also extensive literature highlighting the role of simulation in assisting social work students to develop key insights in regard to skills and knowledge through role-plays. Using a Cross-Over design, this paper compares the contribution of drama students with service users in the preparation of social work students for field practice in Northern Ireland. Our findings suggest there is an important role for both drama students and service users working collaboratively to help social work students develop in key areas of social work competence and have implications for social work education in an international context.

J	Wild, S; Heuling, LS				Wild, Steffen; Heuling, Lydia Schulze			How do the digital competences of students in vocational schools differ from those of students in cooperative higher education institutions in Germany?	EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING			English	Article						Digital competences; Vocational school students; Co-op students; D21-Digital-Index; Digital skills; Digital divide	SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; ICT LITERACY; CHALLENGES; DIVIDE; LEVEL; LIFE	Digital skills are thought to be a key competence of the twenty-first century. With the rapid growth of internet and communication tool (ICT) usage among both students and teachers, cooperative (co-op) education programmes, like other educational institutions, face the challenge of integrating and supporting digital skill development. However, little is known about how these skills are developed prior to entering cooperative education programmes. Against this background, a sample of 893 freshers, ranging from vocational students to co-op students, were tested according to their digital skills. The analysis shows that co-op students have a higher level of competence than vocational students. In addition, we found that in our sample social background has no impact on digital competences.

Therefore, we conducted a study based on a survey with 704 students who were training as teachers, to whom we applied an adaptation of the empathy scale designed by Gorostiaga et al. (Revista de Educacion 364, 12-38, 2014). The study shows a valid and reliable measure of virtual empathy. Results indicate that only 10 % of the sample reached a high level of virtual empathy and, for this reason, we believe it should be included in teacher education syllabuses.

A systems education guidebook focused on water and a learning framework based on the guidebook were developed, together with two ST assessment instruments (a shared reading and a concept mapping activity with interview protocols). The learning framework was implemented over the course of four-weeks with 32 children aged 5-6 in a pre-school in Turkey. To measure the outcomes, the children were pre-tested and post-tested with the assessment instruments using a mixed method approach. The results revealed a significant development in the ST skills of the children. Children defined system elements related to water more, came to see invisible elements as parts of the system and established high-quality causal relations between system elements related to water.

It is emphasised that the priority is the formation of 'meta-subject results' in junior high school students, which can be seen as universal learning activities that will ensure, to a large extent, the success of learning at the next levels of education. Our research has shown the undeniable effectiveness of innovative curriculum design allied to pupil research activities based on project work when compared with traditional methodological approaches to learning. We argue that the increasing demand to develop key competencies in education gives a heightened need for these pedagogical approaches. Moreover, the introduction of project work allows the teacher to form a pedagogical situation in which the student formulates a goal and achieves it whilst developing the key skills that will underpin their wider education.

J	Hipkins, R				Hipkins, Rosemary			The 'everywhere and nowhere' nature of thinking as a subject-specific competency	THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY			English	Article						Key competencies; Science education; Epistemic thinking	SCIENTIFIC LITERACY; SCIENCE; CURRICULUM; SCHOOLS	Thinking is one of five key competencies that are supposed to be woven into every learning area of the New Zealand Curriculum (NZC). The paper argues that achieving this weaving in the science learning area requires an understanding of the nature and importance of epistemic thinking. Epistemic thinking is pivotal to interpreting the Nature of Science (NOS) strand of the science learning area in ways that support learning outcomes related to informed participation in society (i.e. citizenship competencies). Such current and future participation is signalled as important by NZC. However creating a learning programme congruent with this intent requires schools and teachers to undertake a sophisticated weaving of the various high-level NZC components with the strands and sub-strands of the science learning area. Since many classroom teachers are unlikely to possess the knowledge about science that is needed, or even to be aware that there is 'something more' to thinking competencies that they should be addressing, the provision of appropriate forms of professional learning support is vital. Without such support thinking in general, and epistemic thinking in particular, is likely to remain 'everywhere and nowhere' as a specific outcome of science learning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chen, CH; Chen, KZ; Tsai, HF				Chen, Chang-Hua; Chen, Ken-Zen; Tsai, Hsiao-Feng			Did Self-Directed Learning Curriculum Guidelines Change Taiwanese High-School Students' Self-Directed Learning Readiness?	ASIA-PACIFIC EDUCATION RESEARCHER			English	Article; Early Access						Self-directed Learning; Curriculum Guidelines; High-School Students	MOTIVATION; STRATEGIES; EFFICACY; FEEDBACK; AUTONOMY; IMPACT; GOALS	With the rapid changes in globalization and technology advancement, self-directed learning is argued repeatedly as a key competency needed to survive in the twenty-first century. In August 2019, the Taiwan Ministry of Education implemented the new Curriculum Guidelines for 12-Year Basic Education. Being Taiwan's first official curriculum that promoted self-directed learning, this study contributed to the emerging knowledge of how the introduction of the curriculum guidelines affected students' readiness for self-directed learning. Three cohorts of high school students from seven schools returned 10,020 valid surveys. The Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS), a reputable instrument developed by Lucy Guglielmino (2000), was used in the study. The results provided a bird's-eye view of evidence supporting our explanations for the positive, though slight, effect of implementing new curriculum guidelines in fostering self-directed high-school learners. Moreover, the progression of self-directed learning readiness appeared differently among schools and among different demographic associations. We suggest that future researchers both (a) qualitatively explore how specific latent variables were changed in different instructional interventions, and (b) conduct panel studies to advance our understanding of curriculum reform and learners' self-direction.

JOURNAL OF E-LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY			English	Article						Educational robotics; STEM; Gender; Students'perception; Key competences		In the past years, the use of educational robots has steadily increased, in particular due to the ongoing digitalization of modern societies and the new skills that professions require. It has been argued that educational robotics activities have the potential to promote the acquisition of such skills and may increase pupils' interest in STEM disciplines. Despite these results, only few studies have examined the pupils' perspective regarding the pedagogical value of educational robotics in formal education. Therefore, in this study with 91 pupils aged between 13 and 15 years, we aimed at investigating how pupils perceive educational robotics as a tool to improve their creativity, collaboration, computer science and computational thinking skills and to foster their interest in STEM disciplines. Over a period of one semester, the pupils worked with the robot Thymio II and evaluated their experience through a questionnaire. The results showed that boys and girls have different perceptions on which competences they could enhance: while boys affirmed more often than girls, that they could improve their computer science and computational thinking skills, the opposite was found for collaboration and creativity. Moreover, the results illustrated that educational robotics activities could increase the interest in coding, computer science and engineering, however, this was predominantly observed in boys.

J	Healy, M; Richardson, M				Healy, Mary; Richardson, Mary			Images and identity: Children constructing a sense of belonging to Europe	EUROPEAN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article						European Identity; belonging; citizenship; art education	NATION-STATE; CITIZENSHIP; NEED	The European Framework for Key Competences (2006) promotes a shared European identity as a priority for assuring a cohesive future for the European Union (EU), yet the development of a discrete European identity remains acutely contentious, with critics claiming it is too shallow to support the bonds of solidarity needed to engender and support a shared future together'. Most EU member states now have some sort of citizenship curriculum within their state education systems and most are aware that such programmes are difficult to introduce, to teach and to assess within conventional school curricula. However, much of the citizenship education literature tells us that educators are conscious of the problematic nature of exploring citizenship identities. Drawing on both philosophical perspectives and an empirical investigation undertaken by one of the authors, this paper argues that issues of belonging may prove a useful way to explore wider conceptions of citizenship. The research was designed to examine how visual art and citizenship education could be combined to explore and extend children's notions of European identity, using data from Images & Identity, an EU-funded 2-year curriculum development project on citizenship and art education in the Czech Republic, England, Ireland, Germany, Malta and Portugal.

J	Lim, C; Han, H				Lim, Cheolil; Han, Hyeongjong			Development of instructional design strategies for integrating an online support system for creative problem solving into a University course	ASIA PACIFIC EDUCATION REVIEW			English	Article						Creativity; Creative problem solving; Online support system; Instructional design strategy	DIRECTIONS; EDUCATION	This study examined three cases in which an online support system was utilized to enhance creative problem solving (CPS) in a higher education setting. This study aimed to review instructional design strategies that allow the integration of an online support system into a university course. Creativity, which is defined as the ability to generate a new and useful idea, is a key competency for students to possess as it can assist them in taking effective actions in the future society. Considered to be a representative model for developing creative thinking abilities, the CPS model is known to effectively stimulate learners' divergent and convergent thinking while supporting a systematic approach to find creative solutions and enabling meaningful learning by utilizing its supporting tools. Considering the advantages derived from using the Online Support System for CPS, three cases across diverse colleges were reviewed: the College of Education, Fine Arts, and Engineering. Through comprehensive analysis, this study proposes major design strategies to achieve the integrated application of the Online Support System to university courses that encourage problem solving abilities. The study also suggests future research directions for CPS using the Online Support System.

J	Compen, B; De Witte, K; Schelfhout, W				Compen, Boukje; De Witte, Kristof; Schelfhout, Wouter			The impact of teacher engagement in an interactive webinar series on the effectiveness of financial literacy education	BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Online teacher professional development; Randomised controlled trial; Webinar; Financial literacy	PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; SELF-EFFICACY; ONLINE; CURRICULUM; COMMUNITIES	This study examines whether online teacher professional development (OTPD), in the form of an interactive webinar series that encourages collaborative learning, improves student achievement. We conducted a randomised controlled trial with 1102 students, 45 teachers and 30 secondary schools in Flanders, Belgium. As a basis for the study, we developed a digital learning path aimed at improving student scores on financial literacy-a multidimensional key competence recently integrated into the curriculum. We demonstrate that the learning path improves student learning outcomes and that enhanced teacher involvement in this programme does not increase learning outcomes unless the teachers participate in the OTPD initiative. Teacher engagement in the webinar series generated student learning outcomes 0.39 standard deviations higher than those of students whose teachers did not receive this intervention, thus, confirming the effectiveness of the OTPD initiative. This effect was found immediately after programme implementation, and it persisted until at least 6 weeks later. As an underlying mechanism, we observe that engagement in the webinar series enhances teachers' self-efficacy. Classroom observations suggest that engagement increases the frequency of providing students with content-related help.

J	Voogt, J; Roblin, NP				Voogt, Joke; Roblin, Natalie Pareja			A comparative analysis of international frameworks for 21st century competences: Implications for national curriculum policies	JOURNAL OF CURRICULUM STUDIES			English	Article						knowledge society; curriculum; 21st century competences; implementation; assessment	KEY COMPETENCES; EDUCATION; ICT	National curricula need to change drastically to comply with the competences needed for the 21st century. In this paper eight frameworks describing 21st century competences were analysed. A comprehensive search for information about 21st century competences was conducted across the official websites of the selected frameworks, resulting in 32 documents that were analysed in detail. Travers and Westbury's framework of curriculum representations was used to determine horizontal and vertical consistency between the frameworks. The frameworks were compared on their underlying rationales and goals, their definition of 21st century competences, and the recommended strategies for the implementation and assessment of these skills in educational practice. In addition three international studies were examined to analyse how various countries (EU member states, OECD countries) and schools (SITES studies) deal (or not) with 21st century competences. The findings indicate a large extent of alignment between the frameworks about what 21st century competences are and why they are important (horizontal consistency), but intentions and practice seemed still far apart, indicating lack of vertical consistency. The implications of the implementation of 21st century competences in national curriculum policies are discussed and recommendations are provided.

J	Hook, P				Hook, Pam			A thinking curriculum	CURRICULUM MATTERS			English	Article								This article explores how schools might develop a curriculum and pedagogy for the understanding of thinking, rather than the knowing of thinking. It suggests viewing the understanding of thinking processes through Bereiter and Scardamalia's interpretation of educational process in Popper's three-world schema. Such an interpretation leads schools to the development of a more purposive thinking schema, allowing approaches to the curriculum "key competency" called thinking to be aligned to a pedagogy based upon a structured overview of student learning outcomes, and appropriate interventions and assessment practices.				pam@hooked-on-thinking.com						Biggs J., 1982, EVALUATING QUALITY L; Chick HL, 2005, CURRIC MATTERS, V1, P87; Claxton G., 2004, BE CREATIVE ESSENTIA; Costa A.

J	Wang, YJ; Sommier, M; Vasques, A				Wang, Yijing; Sommier, Melodine; Vasques, Ana			Sustainability education at higher education institutions: pedagogies and students' competences	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Competencies; Higher education; Sustainability education; Pedagogies; Educational level; Environmental attitudes	KEY COMPETENCES; ECOLOGICAL PARADIGM; BEHAVIOR; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK; PROGRAM; TEACH	Purpose This study aims to examine whether the development of students' sustainability competences is dependent on how courses are delivered at higher education institutions (HEIs). It further investigates to what extent such competences can affect students' belief in the new environmental paradigm (NEP) and pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs). Design/methodology/approach The data was collected through an online survey conducted in 2021 among the students of an international research university based in The Netherlands. The final sample (N = 262) consisted of all the students who completed the survey and claimed that they had taken at least one course that addressed sustainability. Linear regression models were used to examine the relationship of sustainability education and students' competences, as well as their pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. Findings The findings reveal that the strength of universal, broadly applicable pedagogies is positively related to the development of students' sustainability mindset/framework as well as their sustainability action/communication. The results also reveal that developing students' competences on sustainability mindset/framework is directly related to their belief in the NEP and PEBs. Originality/value To develop an integrative pedagogical approach requires understanding how a HEI's engagement in sustainability can impact students' attitudes and behaviors, but little research has actually measured the development of students' competences. This study fills this gap through empirically testing how different pedagogical approaches can affect students' sustainability competences differently. This has important implications for systematically linking pedagogical approaches to teaching practices or concrete learning objectives.

J	Amado, A; Dalelo, A; Adomssent, M; Fischer, D				Amado, Addise; Dalelo, Aklilu; Adomssent, Maik; Fischer, Daniel			Engaging teacher educators with the sustainability agenda A case study of a pilot professional development program from Ethiopia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Professional development; Teacher training; Sub-Saharan Africa; Capacity building; Global south; Whole-institution approach	KEY COMPETENCES; UNIVERSITY	Purpose - There is broad consensus that the implementation of education for sustainable development (ESD) requires the consideration of geographical and cultural contexts. Despite such an agreement at a theoretical level, there is so far an apparent lack of practical experiences and solid research on approaches that effectively manage to engage professional educators in higher education with ESD in the context of a developing country from the Global South. This paper aims to address this gap and present a case study from a pilot professional development program (PDP) that sought to implement and mainstream ESD among Ethiopian colleges of teacher education (CTEs) and theological seminaries (TSs). Design/methodology/approach - The research presented is based on the methodology of evaluative case study research in ESD. It analyzes the PDP's specific objectives with regard to capacity and structure building, describes major activities implemented and how these relate to the objectives and explores major outcomes of the PDP. Findings - The paper presents a comprehensive training curriculum aimed at addressing ESD in Ethiopian CTEs and TSs in a whole-institution approach. Results suggest that the PDP's approach to combine human capacity and institutional structure building was effective in supporting the implementation and mainstreaming of ESD in CTEs and TSs in Ethiopia. Originality/value - This case study presents original research on a pilot Ethiopian PDP that was implemented in collaboration with two academic institutions from Ethiopia and Germany.

J	Andic, D				Andic, Dunja			Continuing professional development of teachers in Education for Sustainable Development - case study of the Republic of Croatia	TEACHER DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Teachers; educational forms; continuing professional development (CPD); competences; Education for Sustainable Development (ESD)	KEY COMPETENCES	This article presents the results of a continuing professional development (CPD) study of teachers in Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in Croatia. This article and research aimed to determine the contribution of educational forms to the likelihood of teachers becoming involved in CPD for ESD, as well as to engage in a discussion about the Competence-based approach in ESD. The tasks of the research were to determine the level of achieving ESD competences, the correlations with educational forms/training, and the contribution of forms of education/training for CPD for teachers in ESD. A survey questionnaire was developed, which contained a scale of self-assessment of teacher competencies for ESD. The sample of respondents comprised 1096 primary school teachers. The results indicate that an average high level of achievement competences was obtained, as well as a relation to individual forms of education. The results indicate 28% of the explanation of the total variance with regards to the contribution of educational forms to the level of achieved teacher competencies for ESD and a very small contribution to the likelihood of inclusion into CPD for ESD. The research points to the inadequate implementation of ESD in the CPD of teachers.

The Educational Technology Competency Survey (ETCS) developed in this research was based on a conceptual framework that emphases the definition of educational technology and associated knowledge, skill, and ability statements (KSAs). Using the conceptual framework, the study was executed in four phases: (1) an extant review of relevant literature related to competencies of educational technology professionals, (2) job announcement analysis of 400 postings from five relevant databases, (3) extraction and merging of the KSA statements from the job announcements and relevant literature, (4) administration of the survey on a wide-variety of educational technology professionals (N = 219). One hundred seventy-six KSA competencies were derived from the process and organized into KSA statements. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and multivariate analysis of variance. The findings demonstrate key competencies such as instructional design, project management, learning theories, working in teams with diverse stakeholders, and twenty-first-century proficiencies. Discussion and recommendations for future research and practice are provided. The ETCS was found to be a valid and reliable measurement system for these data.

J	Jolle, L				Jolle, Lennart			Pair assessment of pupil writing: A dialogic approach for studying the development of rater competence	ASSESSING WRITING			English	Article						Writing assessment; Pair assessment; Rater behaviour; Expertise	STUDENTS	This paper reports on rating during the development of a Norwegian sample-based national assessment of L1 writing as a key competency. This assessment is to be officially introduced in August 2014. Novice members of a national rater panel to assess Year 8 pupils' texts were studied during three of their successive training sessions: in June 2011, November 2011 and April 2012. My purpose was to conduct an exploratory investigation into how the rating practice of novice raters might develop during such a preparatory stage. The raters in this study mainly assessed in pairs, and data sources were assessment dialogues. The analysis of transcripts showed that rater behaviour changed only to a minor extent towards an increased use of shared assessment resources. The quality of the assessment dialogues did not change much either, leaving the impression that raters often reached consensus without much discussion. Since reliable scoring is a collective task, however, it is argued that a more balanced use of resources, both those attained from teacher practice and those attained from being a member of a national panel, may together with more exploration-oriented dialogue be necessary to achieve sufficient reliability.

Quest in a Digital School: the Potential and Peculiarities of Mobile Technology Implementation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION			English	Article						quest; competencies; digital educational space; teaching methods; mobile applications; challenges of the future	TEACHERS	The problem of the research is due to the need to realize the didactic and interdisciplinary potential of mobile applications which are able to support the quest technology. Teachers have to understand peculiarities of organizing such a game form of activity in a digital school. The purpose of the study is to theoretically prove and experimentally test the effectiveness of using mobile game applications in the "quest" genre in order to form necessary competencies of future specialists in a digital school environment. The research methodology is the analysis and synthesis of psychological and pedagogical work, methods of mathematical statistics, and methods of psychodiagnostics. The pedagogical experiment of the study is the assessment of the formation of basic competences which provide the base in the field of computer science, cybernetics and artificial intelligence required by the state and society. Results of the study. The study proves the didactic potential of mobile applications which are able to support the quest technology in order to achieve high-priority objectives in the project "Digital School". The authors describe ideas of the methodical approach, which reflect the necessary changes in the support of students' cognitive activity through mobile game applications in the quest genre. The study shows levels of differentiation of education depending on the individual and age characteristics of students and the choice of digital means. The authors prove that the "quest" technology, focused work to solve education tasks, motivates future professional activities, and also with the help of modern digital means, contributes to the development of such necessary cross-professional competencies of future specialists as project activities, systems thinking, interaction and interindustry communication. In conclusion, the authors confirm that the inclusion of mobile game applications in the "quest" genre in education activities will help to form key competencies and skills that meet the priorities of the digital school and are most in demand by society.

J	Perez-Rodriguez, A; Delgado, A				Perez-Rodriguez, Amor; Delgado, Agueda			From Digital and Audiovisual Competence to Media Competence: Dimensions and indicators	COMUNICAR			English	Article						Media competence; key competences; digital competence; media literacy; dimensions and indicators		The need to set out the conceptualization of media competence leads to a broader perspective in which there is a convergence of factors linked to the digital and audiovisual competences, both of which constitute the reference frame work for "information processing and digital competence", which is the key competence in Spain's national curriculum. Despite the ongoing experiences in audiovisual and digital communication few attempts have been made to define the knowledge, skills and attitudes needed for a person to be deemed competent in these two areas, which are essential for the teaching and learning processes. This paper analyzes six important studies on digital and audiovisual literacy, considering issues such as the recipients, the conceptualization used in each study and the dimensions they suggest, the type of taxonomy, indicators...and the educational proposals: objectives, content, activities are systematized in a series of dimensions and indicators to define media literacy and design activities for a didactic proposal in accordance with the indicators established. The development of this research has led us to affirm the need for convergence in terminology and the expansion of resources based on the indicators defined, which affect the diverse areas of media literacy in an effective way and function to enable teaching actions among the various groups that comprise today's society.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether the perspectives of teacher educators, teachers and students on good education in vocational education are aligned with what literature says about Powerful Learning Environments (PLEs) and to what extent the perspectives of different groups of stakeholders are mutually aligned. Results of nine focus group interviews showed that perspectives are mostly similar in the three groups. They strongly favoured authentic and challenging pathways, endorsed the importance of supporting opportunities for developing key competences and, although not univocal by students, adaptive teaching and learning support, within a positive and safe learning community. Differences between preferences of different stakeholders on some of the design characteristics of PLEs underline the importance of developing a shared understanding about learning and teaching among stakeholders.

Movement must grow in an integral way, and it is a basic language that can articulate a kind of innovative and critical education imbued with emotional intelligence. It also allows active methodologies to be defined and applied in order to enhance and develop the competencies, skills and abilities at school which should promote individual, school, family and social ecosystems. Movement integrates the development of the aspects of intrapersonal and interpersonal relationships that contribute to an individual's success and happiness. Likewise, the neuroscientific foundations that support the construction of movement which allows for relationships, actions and creativity are discussed. Based on this, the authors of this paper posit the need to develop motor skills as one of the key competencies at schools and other educational centers by incorporating the associated competencies of dance and all the arts to empower creativity and emotional learning.

The objectives were to assess the differences between highly-structured cooperative learning (HSCL) and individual learning (IL) in university students' content knowledge, and to assess the impact of the teacher's highly-structured instruction on the variables that mediate CL. Students enrolled in a teacher training programme (n = 201, M-age = 20.38 +/- 4.97) were classified in two groups. Participants in the HSCL group showed higher academic achievement. It was also observed that the HSCL environment was related to the five variables that mediate CL. These results identified three important considerations in university teaching: CL is a key competence that can have an impact on the students' learning process and it should be a key element in teacher-training programs; this competence should be incorporated by lecturers to deliver a structured learning process; and these objectives can be achieved in an online learning environment.

J	Kostova, N				Kostova, Nataliia			STRUCTURAL MODEL OF STUDENTS-FUTURE LAWYERS' PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE	SCIENCE AND EDUCATION			English	Article						lawyer; professional competence; competency; structure; factorial and criterial model; factor; criterion		The paper aims to present a designed factorial and criterial model of lawyer's professional competence. The research is based on factorial and criterial modelling method, Delphi method, and methods of mathematical statistics. It has been found that the occupation of a lawyer is characterized by systematicity, dynamism, value orientations, responsibility, the ability to perform professional duties properly. Professional competence of a lawyer has a three-level hierarchical structure: the first level is composed of key competences: civil, social, purposeful development, general cultural, responsibility; the second one involves general competences: legal, administrative, functional, communicative, educational, and scientific; the third level is presented by special professional competences: special theoretical and special functional competences. Based on qualimetric approach there has been designed a model of lawyer's professional competence, where the levels and kinds of competences are defined by factors and criteria. The weight coefficients for every factor and criterion have been calculated. The peculiarity of this model is the possibility of adapting it to the specificity of any kind of legal activities which provides its flexibility.

Therefore, it is essential to understand how students at the end of compulsory schooling use scientific knowledge for understanding the surrounding world. The objective of this study is to understand how students construct a scientifically oriented explanation while making sense of a phenomenon related to health. We analysed 526 answers to a question of a Portuguese national 9th grade science exam. The results reveal that most students present difficulties in explaining a phenomenon related to health supported by logical and clear reasoning, and in mobilizing scientific knowledge for connecting different scientific domains. We reaffirm the need to reconceptualize the role of health education within science education. Developing reading, writing and discussion activities related to health, which requires the use of scientific knowledge from different domains, would facilitate students' understanding and appropriation of scientific knowledge and its transference. This is a fundamental competence for promoting active and informed citizenship.

This study focused on a recent K-12 curriculum reform in Macau with the purpose of exploring the issue of integrating 21(st)century competencies in the subjects-based curriculum documents, i.e.,Requirements of Basic Academic Attainments(RBAAs). Based on an analytical framework of 21(st)century competencies, the distributions of those competencies embedded in "curriculum goals" of 39 RBAAs across the K-12 schooling were analysed. Key findings can be summarized in three ways: (1) the category of "Ways of thinking" takes the most proportion while that of "Tools for working" takes the least from primary to senior secondary with "Living in the world" being most concerned in pre-primary; (2) discrepancies exist among the distributions of ten 21(st)century competencies across the K-12 schooling and (3) some competencies are more concerned in some certain learning domains. The results of this study have provided two implications for the issue of integrating 21(st)century competencies in the school curriculum in the rest of the world: a reasonable relation should be taken between key competencies and curriculum goals and different competencies will be emphasized at different educational stages and for different subjects.

J	Grimminger-Seidensticker, E; Mohwald, A				Grimminger-Seidensticker, Elke; Moehwald, Aiko			Intercultural education in physical education: results of a quasi-experimental intervention study with secondary school students	PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY			English	Article						Intercultural competence; physical education; Intercultural Movement Education; quasi-experimental study; intervention study	ACCULTURATION; ATTITUDES; MAJORITY	Background: Due to migration processes, cultural diversity and strangeness are becoming characteristics of modern society. The competence to handle this heterogeneity - the so-called intercultural competence - is a key competence for all children and youths. Sports and physical education (PE) are often considered as a particular field for enhancing intercultural competence. However, until now there is no theory-based empirical study that proves this assumption. Purpose: This study was designed to examine the effects of a standardised, theoretically driven programme in PE on the development of underlying cognitive concepts of intercultural competence: acculturation attitudes and attitudes towards cultural diversity. Research design: The research design consists of a quasi-experimental design with four measurement points. The intervention group (N=69; mean age=11.6 years (SD=0.60)) followed standardised and theory-driven intervention lessons following the didactical guidelines of the concept of Intercultural Movement Education' (IME). The developed games tend to trigger crises' with the aim to insecure students. These experienced insecurities were afterwards reflected upon with the students. The internal control group (N=63; mean age=11.8 years (SD=0.62)) and external control group (N=93; mean age=10.8 years (SD=0.69)) were taught in a unspecific manner. The impact of the intervention study programme was tested with a reliable and valid questionnaire. Results: A significant time by group interaction effect for the subscale assimilation/segregation' of acculturation attitudes was found in boys and in girls. The attitudes increased significantly after the intervention. For the girls, the intervention group showed also a significant decrease of the attitude integration'. No significant impact of the intervention study on the attitudes towards cultural diversity could be identified either with boys or girls. Discussion: The effects of the study are ambivalent. The significantly increased assimilative attitudes can be interpreted as a need for a sense of security. This is also underlined by the decrease of the integration attitude that values the maintenance of cultural integrity. It must be critically discussed whether the crises' were too intense and not adapted to the children's skills to overcome them. Second, we have to critically analyse whether the discussions with the students about their experiences were sufficiently focused to debrief the students. Summary for practitioners: The competence to handle heterogeneity - the so-called intercultural competence - is a key competence for children and youths. Sports and PE are often considered as a particular field for enhancing intercultural competence. However, until now there has been no theory-based empirical study that proves this assumption. This paper describes the development, implementation and evaluation of an intervention programme on intercultural learning in PE along the didactic guidelines of IME. This programme tries to trigger crises' that stimulate the students to react and think about their self- and world relations. The statistical analyses show that the crises' were probably too intense as the students' scores in assimilation attitudes increased.

RadioActive101-Learning through radio, learning for life: an international approach to the inclusion and non-formal learning of socially excluded young people	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INCLUSIVE EDUCATION			English	Article						Non-formal learning; socially excluded young people; contemporary skills; internet radio; pedagogical issues; psychosocial dimensions	EXCLUSION	This article describes an original international approach to inclusion and non-formal learning of socially excluded young people, through participatory internet radio - RadioActive101. First, we critically discuss the social and digital exclusion of young people. We then describe our approach - that includes participatory action research methods that are influenced by the work of Dewey and Freire, and operate as a process of complex intervention. This supports the inclusive co-production of radio content in ways that support non-formal learning in two EU contexts - the UK and Portugal. We then summarise and compare a qualitative investigation of RadioActive101. This showed positive results, with important similarities and differences between the two contexts. Participants reported that RadioActive101 was motivating and contributed to the development of contemporary skills, and also stimulated improvements in psychosocial dimensions such as confidence (self-efficacy) and self-esteem. This investigation informed the development of an original recognition system for non-formal learning that maps EU Key Competences for Lifelong Learning to radio practices and activities that are recognised through electronic badges. Our reflections emphasise that in order to support the non-formal learning of socially excluded young people we must foreground our attention to fostering psychosocial dimensions alongside developing contemporary competences.

J	Benade, L				Benade, Leon			Shame: Does it have a place in an education for democratic citizenship?	EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY			English	Article						democratic citizenship; virtues education; reintegrative shaming; restorative justice; shame	GUILT	Shame, shame management and reintegrative shaming feature in some restorative justice literature, and may have implications for schools. Restorative justice in schools is effective when perpetrators of wrong-doing can accept and take ownership of their wrongful acts, are appropriately remorseful, and seek to make amends. Shame may be understood as an ethical matter if it is regarded to arise because of the contradiction between the wrongful act and the individual's sense of self and self-worth. Shame management (that is, seeking reintegrative over stigmatising shaming) can be regarded to reflect a form of social responsibility as it contributes to community restoration by repairing ruptured social relationships. The notion of shaming and acknowledgement of harm thus assumes norms of acceptable community behaviour, attitudes and relationships, and is therefore also an ethical matter. Successful restorative practices in schools depend on the school-wide existence and practice of such norms, and mesh with virtues education, stimulated by the contemporary demand of many national curricula to promote so-called key competencies. Although the concepts of restorative justice and reintegrative shaming serve as a context for this article, its chief impetus was provided by an evaluative study of a group of New Zealand schools, in the course of which notions such as shame, reintegration and exclusion became evident. The chief purpose of this article is to consider and problematise shame from the perspective of the philosophy of education, and ask whether the concept of shame has a place in schools, whose important aims ought to include the development of democratic citizenship.

High-, moderate- and low-utility learning techniques and perceived learning difficulties	BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Learning techniques; Learning difficulties; Medical students	PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; UNDERGRADUATE; SCHOOL; EDUCATION; SUCCESS	Background Acquiring medical knowledge is a key competency for medical students and a lifelong requirement for physicians. Learning techniques can improve academic success and help students cope with stressors. To support students' learning process medical faculties should know about learning techniques. The purpose of this study is to analyse the preferred learning techniques of female and male as well as junior and senior medical students and how these learning techniques are related to perceived learning difficulties. Methods In 2019, we conducted an online survey with students of the undergraduate, competency-based curriculum of medicine at Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin. We chose ten learning techniques of high, moderate and low utility according to Dunlosky et al. (2013) and we asked medical students to rate their preferred usage of those techniques using a 5-point Likert scale. We applied t-tests to show differences in usage between female and male as well as junior and senior learners. Additionally, we conducted a multiple regression analysis to explore the predictive power of learning techniques regarding perceived difficulties. Results A total of 730 medical students (488 women, 242 men, M-age = 24.85, SD = 4.49) use three techniques the most: 'highlighting' (low utility), 'self-explanation' (moderate utility) and 'practice testing' (high utility). Female students showed a significantly higher usage of low-utility learning techniques (t(404.24) = -7.13, p < .001) and a higher usage of high-utility learning techniques (t(728) = -2.50, p < .05) than male students (M = 3.55, SD = .95). Compared to junior students (second to sixth semester; M = 3.65, SD = .71), senior students (seventh semester to final clerkship year; M = 3.52, SD = .73) showed a lower use of low-utility learning techniques (t(603) = 2.15, p < .05). Usage of low-utility techniques is related to more difficulties (beta = .08, t(724) = 2.13, p < .05). Usage of moderate-utility techniques is related to less learning difficulties (beta = -.13, t(599) = -3.21, p < .01). Conclusions Students use a wide range of low-, moderate- and high-utility learning techniques. The use of learning techniques has an influence on the difficulties perceived by students. Therefore, they could benefit from knowing about and using high-utility learning techniques to facilitate their learning. Faculties should inform their students about effective learning and introduce them to useful learning techniques.

Specifically, it examined the cooccurrence relations of countries/regions, major journals, most cited references, and hot keywords from the macroscopic, mesoscopic and microscopic level of RST. The results showed that the core strength of RST is mainly from traditional industrialized countries such as the United States, Australia, and Britain. And some top journals in science education (such as Journal of Research in Science Teaching, Science Education) has to pay more attention on RST, it may also appeal to lots of top journals in general teacher education (such as Journal of Teacher Education, Teaching and Teaher Education). The research on science teachers was guided by several educational theories about teacher research, such as the teacher epistemological belief, reflective practice, and PCK. Moreover, theories in science education such as scientific literacy, scientific conceptual change also becomes the theoretical basis for science teachers' teaching practice and scientific inquiry instructing. The knowledge, key competences, dispositions, and professional development of science teacher are the main keywords and hot topics in the field of RST.

J	Davison, M				Davison, Martyn			The case for empathy in the history classroom	CURRICULUM MATTERS			English	Article								This article argues that empathy has an important place in the history classroom and can contribute to the aims of The New Zealand Curriculum (Ministry of Education, 2007). The article examines the concept of empathy from both an affective and cognitive angle. It proposes that empathy is linked to The New Zealand Curriculum in the affective domain through the key competency relating to others and cognitively through the Social Sciences learning area's focus on understanding people's perspectives. The article also examines differing ways of conceptualising empathy within history education and seeks to explain what these might mean for practice.

J	Lambrechts, W				Lambrechts, Wim			The contribution of sustainability assessment to policy development in higher education	ASSESSMENT & EVALUATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						sustainable higher education; sustainability assessment; policy development; AISHE	KEY COMPETENCES; TOOL	This article builds upon the experiences and results of the application of sustainability assessment instruments in higher education. First, a short overview of existing sustainability assessment tools will be provided, as well as their contribution towards the integration of sustainability in higher education. Second, a reflective case focuses on the use of sustainability assessment for policy development in higher education. This case is based upon the application of the Auditing Instrument for Sustainability in Higher Education in a Belgian higher education institution, focusing on four consecutive assessments in the department of Business Studies (2003, 2004, 2009, 2010). Based on the assessment reports and an evaluation of the assessments, the contribution of sustainability assessment to policy development is reflected upon. The article provides a research-based, reflective study, and focuses on the consecutive application of sustainability assessment tools, the contribution of sustainability assessment to policy development and the contribution of sustainability assessment to connecting a bottom-up approach to a top-down approach. The article results in specific recommendations on the use of sustainability assessment for policy development in higher education.

However, research on the assessment of writing skills in English as a foreign language in European upper secondary education (i.e. beyond year 9) remains scarce. The Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) describes language proficiency on a scale of six ascending levels (A1-C2). For writing skills at the end of secondary education in Europe, the common standard is vantage level B2. In this study, experts from Germany and Switzerland linked upper secondary students' writing profiles elicited in a constructed response test (integrated and independent essays from the TOEFL iBT(center dot)) to CEFR levels. Standard setting methodology (a modified examinee paper selection/performance profile approach) was used to establish the linkages. The study reports the methodology and procedure of the standard setting process and discusses the procedural and internal validity of resulting cut scores. It also applies the cut scores to a large sample of upper secondary students in Germany and Switzerland to gain evidence for external and consequential validity.

J	El Shennawy, D; Teba-Fernandez, EM				El Shennawy, Dina; Teba-Fernandez, Eva Maria			The Educational End: how Learning Languages Should Prepare for the Future	JOURNAL OF LEARNING STYLES			English	Article						Task-based learning; global competence; CLT-Communicative Language Teaching; Key Competences; 21st century skills; Language adquisition		In a 21st century dominated by VUCA environments (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous) and in an increasingly diverse and global society, education should rethink how to meet the real needs of the citizens of the present and the future. Educational methods for language instruction have received assiduous attention from researchers, that may have overlooked educational ends, and that is to serve real life purposes. Learning a language is more than just acquiring knowledge about a new linguistic norm and its rules: it is above all, a vehicle for communication, an open channel to the world and a new scope with which new cultures are explored and different views and perspectives are discovered and shared. This paper aims at exploring task-based learning approach for language instruction and presenting a study on the benefits attributed to this approach, relating them to existing trends in current educational innovation. In doing so, a comparison between meaning-based learning and instruction-based learning is needed. Here we will review some of the most relevant theories and approaches to better understand task-based learning and explore its potential.

J	Canelas, DA; Hill, JL; Novicki, A				Canelas, Dorian A.; Hill, Jennifer L.; Novicki, Andrea			Cooperative learning in organic chemistry increases student assessment of learning gains in key transferable skills	CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE			English	Article							PROFESSIONAL SKILLS; GENERAL-CHEMISTRY; FLIPPED CLASSROOM; GUIDED-INQUIRY; INSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; SCIENCE; LECTURE; ENGAGEMENT; RETENTION	Science and engineering educators and employers agree that students should graduate from college with expertise in their major subject area as well as the skills and competencies necessary for productive participation in diverse work environments. These competencies include problem-solving, communication, leadership, and collaboration, among others. Using a pseudo-experimental design, and employing a variety of data from exam scores, course evaluations, and student assessment of learning gains (SALG) surveys of key competencies, we compared the development of both chemistry content knowledge and transferable or generic skills among students enrolled in two types of large classes: a lecture-based format versus an interactive, constructive, cooperative learning (flipped classroom) format. Controlling for instructor, as well as laboratory and recitation content, students enrolled in the cooperative learning format reported higher learning gains than the control group in essential transferable skills and competency areas at the end of the term, and more growth in these areas over the course of the term. As a result of their work in the class, the two groups of students reported the most significant differences in their gains in the following areas: "interacting productively to solve problems with a diverse group of classmates,'' "behaving as an effective leader,'' "behaving as an effective teammate,'' and "comfort level working with complex ideas.'' Our findings clearly show that cooperative learning course designs allow students to practice and develop the transferable skills valued by employers.

J	Zinkunegi-Goitia, O; Rekalde-Rodriguez, I				Zinkunegi-Goitia, Olatz; Rekalde-Rodriguez, Itziar			Employability within an Education for Sustainability Framework: The Ocean i3 Case Study	EDUCATION SCIENCES			English	Article						higher education; employability; cross-discipline competences; sustainability; case study	KEY COMPETENCES; SKILLS	The Council of the European Union recalls that higher education plays a fundamental role in shaping the future of Europe. Therefore, curricula are required to take into account the competences demanded by the job market so that future workers can effectively undertake their professional activities and form part of an active, responsible, ecological, sustainable, and resilient society. Ocean i3 is a cross-border project with the aim of achieving sustainability in the oceans by training students to become environmentally concerned and responsible professionals. This study explores the perception of students and teachers regarding their participation in Ocean i3 and their understanding of employability. A qualitative methodological approach has been used, based on a case study in which semi-structured interviews have been carried out and the Elevator Pitch presentation technique has been applied. Nine students and four teachers from the University of the Basque Country and the University of Bordeaux have been interviewed. The results highlight the importance of the participants' first contact with the project, the need to be explicit regarding competences that favour employability during the development of the experience, and the need to increase and reinforce internships at social entities located in the territory. It is concluded that the project should focus more explicitly on the concept of employability to raise students' awareness of the impact that their current participation in Ocean i3 can have on their professional future and insertion in the workplace.

J	Li, JZ				Li, Junzheng			Critical thinking of a translator: Expanding the practice of using and editing machine translation	THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY			English	Article						Competencies; Critical thinking; Machine translation; Post-editing; Translation; Translation quality; Translators		The availability of machine translation allows both non-professionals and professional translators to use its capabilities, who use computer translation as a basis, and then analyze the resulting text and creatively process it in order to bring it as close to the original as possible. The aim of the present research is to study the influence of critical thinking on the quality of machine translation post-editing. The research was conducted at the College of College of Foreign Languages and Zhoukou Normal University and [BLINDED] University. The primary sample of respondents, heterogeneous in terms of age, gender, race, and ethnicity, was formed from 246 professional translators for whom the native language was Chinese. After determining the level of critical thinking using the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Test in the 2011 modification and the Critical Thinking Assessment Test (CAT), two experimental groups of respondents were formed: with high and low levels of critical thinking. These groups were provided with the same standardized texts for translation, using the same set of software tools, and subsequent editing. The translation results were evaluated by 12 experts with over 20 years of experience in translation. Errors were divided into groups: syntactic, lexical, grammatical, stylistic. The number of errors of each type and the average number of detected errors for each translator were estimated. The results obtained were compared using the Student's t-test using the Excel program and an online calculator. As a result of the study, the null hypothesis about no influence of a translator's critical thinking level on translation quality was refuted, and a direct significant correlation between a high level of critical thinking and a smaller number of post-editing errors was shown. It seems important to conduct further research to determine the influence of a translator's critical thinking, language proficiency, and experience on translation quality, since in this study, translators' length of service and the level of language proficiency were not taken into account. The development of critical thinking as a key competence ensures that informed decisions are made that affect the quality of machine translation post-editing. Practical significance of the study is based on the opportunity to use of the proposed technique to study the influence of other types of translation on the formation of critical thinking of the translator. The further research can be based on the determination the influence of critical thinking, language proficiency, and experience of a translator on translation quality, since in this study the length of service and language proficiency of translators were not taken into account.

J	Pitura, J; Terlecka-Pacut, E				Pitura, Joanna; Terlecka-Pacut, Elzbieta			Action research on the application of technology assisted urban gaming in language education in a Polish upper-secondary school	COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING			English	Article						Urban game; language learning; mobile technology; upper-secondary school	LOCATION-BASED GAMES; DIGITAL GAMES; MOBILE GAME; ENGLISH; IMPLEMENTATION; STUDENTS; IMPACT; MALL	Being able to communicate in foreign languages, along with the remaining key competences for lifelong learning, are of special significance for upper-secondary school students - soon-to-be tertiary education students and employees. Although Polish educational authorities have made efforts to account for this need in the Core Curriculum for Modern Languages, the provisions are pursued with difficulty in school practice. The aim of this paper is to address this challenge by exploring and evaluating the feasibility and student-participant perceptions of urban gaming in school settings as a didactic tool that facilitates language education, as well as digital, social, and learning to learn skills development in an upper-secondary school. Accordingly, the paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a technology assisted urban game named As it once was in Cracowdiscovering the history of the city', developed for a group of Polish upper-secondary school students (N = 25) from Warsaw.

To test how intercultural competences might be taught in engineering programmes in Spain, a country where many young people have to emigrate in order to find work, an experimental group of engineers was trained in the acquisition of intercultural competences, and compared to a control group in the same field. Students exposed to the intercultural content performed significantly better on later intercultural assessments. Pedagogical implications show that teaching intercultural skills in monoculture contexts is feasible.

J	Grant, D				Grant, David			Feeling for meaning: the making and understanding of Image Theatre	RIDE-THE JOURNAL OF APPLIED THEATRE AND PERFORMANCE			English	Article						Image Theatre; Augusto Boal; cognitive science; kinaesthetic empathy; Northern Ireland		Using iconic images created by students in Belfast and Sarajevo of their respective cities, this paper will explore how emerging ideas in the field of cognitive science (e.g. Gallagher, S. 2005. How the Body Shapes the Mind. Oxford: Clarendon Press) can help explain the making and understanding of Augusto Boal's Image Theatre'. There has been growing interest in the intersection between performance and cognitive science (McConachie, B., and H. E. Hart, eds. 2006. Performance and Cognition: Theatre Studies after the Cognitive Turn. Routledge), particularly in terms of kinaesthetic empathy (Reynolds, D., and M. Reason, eds. 2012. Kinaesthetic Empathy in Creative and Cultural Practices. Intellect), which can enhance our understanding of the embodied practices associated with Augusto Boal's Image Theatre. This paper will analyse the ambiguities inherent in stage images of contested cities to explore how these may reveal unconscious insights into the image-makers' perception of their home environments. An image of Sarajevo, for instance, ostensibly about the Winter Olympics, prompts consideration of the city's internal divisions. An image of Belfast, ostensibly about the Titanic, suggests the limitations of the city's Peace Process. Taking Boal's idea that stage images should be felt rather than read, this article explores the fine line between feeling and meaning in the understanding of Image Theatre and suggests that alongside literacy and orality we now also need to include imageracy', the ability to interpret and understand images, as a key competency for the modern world.

J	Thomas, I; Day, T				Thomas, Ian; Day, Teresa			Sustainability capabilities, graduate capabilities, and Australian universities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Australia; Sustainable development; Universities; Capabilities; Education for sustainability; Graduate attribute statements	HIGHER-EDUCATION; KEY COMPETENCES	Purpose - In the context of universities implementing education for sustainability (EfS), the aim of the research presented here is to review the extent to which capabilities related to sustainability are represented by the capabilities generally sought by employers, and to determine whether these are incorporated in the graduate capability statements of Australian universities. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the discussion of graduate capabilities and those associated with sustainability, a web-based survey of university graduate attribute statements was undertaken. Findings - Generally, Australian universities have established frameworks of graduate capabilities that relate to the broad needs of employers. Of eight capabilities listed as important by employers, six were identified at some two-thirds of universities. Just under half of the universities' statements contained references to sustainability, while all the literature derived sustainability capabilities, except for "systems/holistic thinking", are represented to some degree. Those most strongly represented included understanding of social justice and equity; skills in communication and cooperation; and having commitment to social justice and equity. Practical implications - Apparently, in Australian universities, the framework for the development of sustainability capabilities is broadly in place, but not all have sustainability capabilities in place. This framework supports the implementation of EfS, but without development of pedagogy to underlie implementation, the authors have little insight about the extent of implementation, and whether graduates leave with sustainability capabilities.

J	Bondaruk, Y				Bondaruk, Yana			THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUTURE EFL TEACHERS' INFORMATION COMPETENCE IN PROFESSIONAL TRAINING	ADVANCED EDUCATION			English	Article						future EFL teachers; information technologies; communication; professional training; professional development; information competence		The article explicates the significance of the development of future EFL teachers' information competence for their professional career and investigates the possibility to improve this competence in studying English. It also reveals the relations between information competence and professional development of future EFL teachers and proves that information competence has become the important one for life-long education of EFL teachers. It depicts that the information competence influences the professional level of future EFL teachers, their creative skills and abilities. In the article, compulsory and optional courses in the system of the teacher education for the development of information competence are analysed. It examines the importance of the use of information technology during professional training, as it solves not only the task to improve future EFL teachers' education but the development of the information competence of new generation school teachers. It proves that digital technologies influence the development of new ways of teaching and learning English, form new professional characteristics of EFL teachers; create new key competences for lifelong learning of future professionals. It deals with the problem that the lack of adequate access to the information and communication technology has the influence on the development of highly skilled professionals in the sphere of English language education.

J	Radberg, KK; Lundqvist, U; Malmqvist, J; Svensson, OH				Radberg, Kamilla Kohn; Lundqvist, Ulrika; Malmqvist, Johan; Svensson, Oskar Hagvall			From CDIO to challenge-based learning experiences - expanding student learning as well as societal impact?	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						Challenge-based learning; CDIO; sustainability; multidisciplinary learning; stakeholder involvement	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; HIGHER-EDUCATION; KEY COMPETENCES; FRAMEWORK	Challenge-based learning (CBL) is a multidisciplinary approach that encourages students to work actively with peers, teachers and stakeholders in society to identify complex challenges, formulate relevant questions and take action for sustainable development. In this paper, it is argued that CBL can be viewed as an evolution of the Conceive, Design, Implement, Operate concept, expanding as well as deepening the learning experience. The study reported on investigates the multiple aims of a particular CBL environment (the Challenge Lab at Chalmers University of Technology), which are to combine significant student learning and societal transformation. The results show that the students perceive that they have developed deep skills in problem formulation and sustainable development, as well as working across disciplines and with different stakeholders. Moreover, the study shows that although few student projects reach implementation stage, there is a potential for societal impact both during and after the Challenge Lab learning experience.

Based on an extensive review of the literature, it provides an overview of current ICT-enabled assessment practices, with a particular focus on the more recent developments of ICT-enhanced assessment tools that recognise 21st century skills. The article also refers to relevant cases of eAssessment, looks into examples of the potential of emerging technologies for eAssessment and discusses some relevant innovation and policy issues. Reflecting on these examples, it argues that, although technological challenges exist, the more pressing task at present is to transcend the traditional testing paradigm and conceptually develop (e)Assessment strategies that allow to more fully exploit the benefits of emerging technologies in order to foster the development of 21st century skills.

J	Karlgren, K; Paavola, S; Ligorio, MB				Karlgren, Klas; Paavola, Sami; Ligorio, Maria Beatrice			Introduction: what are knowledge work practices in education? How can we study and promote them?	RESEARCH PAPERS IN EDUCATION			English	Article						Knowledge work; work practices; lifelong learning; 21st century skills; knowledge creation	PRESERVICE TEACHERS; TECHNOLOGY	New kinds of jobs require managing new kinds of work life competences and a number of such key competences for lifelong learning which equip young people for further learning and employability in a knowledge society have already been identified. Research has however indicated that formal education is not providing adequate support and opportunities for acquiring the needed competencies in practice. More discussion and empirical research is needed about knowledge work competences and related practices in secondary schools, higher education and in the work life. The theme of this special Issue is 'Knowledge work: educational practices preparing students for work life' and it has as its aim to contribute to a discussion on how changes in professional work can be taken into account in educational settings. Of particular interest in this special issue is how educational theory about 'knowledge-creation' is applied in practice. The trialogical approach to learning highlights collaborative knowledge creation and the development of shared, mediating objects. This theory and its associated design principles are introduced. The contributions of this special issue relate to implementing ideas of the trialogical approach to learning in various ways and each contribution is briefly presented.

J	Andrzejewska, M; Stolinska, A				Andrzejewska, Magdalena; Stolinska, Anna			The eye-tracking technique in the analysis of mechanisms for solving algorithmic problems	E-MENTOR			English	Article						algorithmic problems solving; flowchart of algorithms; teaching and learning programming; eye movement parameters; eye tracking	THINKING	The ability to solve problems using algorithms plays an increasingly important role in modern society, whereas programming, alongside with broadly understood digital skills, are considered to be one of the key competences of the future. The result of this trend is the modification in the Polish education system of the IT subjects' core curriculum, under which teaching programming is planned at every stage of education. While teaching the skills of programming is important, it is not an easy task to achieve and hence it poses many methodological challenges. Researchers in this field are increasingly turning to new experimental methods, such as eye tracking techniques that allow to gain an insight into cognitive mechanisms and thus can provide objective information about the process of learning programming. The article discusses the results of authors' own study, in which the state of declarative and procedural knowledge of students related to the forms of algorithm presentation was diagnosed. The questionnaires along with the tasks included in them, which the students solved in a traditional way and with the means of eye tracking techniques, were used in the study to track the process of solving comparable tasks presented on a computer monitor. The indicator of operational knowledge was the effectiveness of problem solving. The research was conducted on a group of 48 third-grade junior secondary school students. The obtained results (low level of correct answers) indicate that the situation in the area of learning the algorithmic skills of students requires improvement. The measurement data obtained using eye tracking allowed for an in-depth analysis and interpretation of visual activity of students. Therefore, it seems that eye tracking can be considered as a complementary research technique, enriching the state of knowledge on cognitive mechanisms that are triggered in the process of solving algorithmic problems.

A fragility approach to sustainability - researching effects of education	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Sustainability management; Fragility; Paradigms; System approach; Functional stupidity	SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; STUDENTS ATTITUDES; BUSINESS STUDENTS; KEY COMPETENCES; UNDERGRADUATE; CAPABILITIES; INTEGRATION	Purpose - Management education trainers are increasingly called upon to train students to devise interventions for sustainable development in business settings. Due to the dominant reductionist paradigm, these interventions may lead to unwanted side effects. Teaching students about unacknowledged feedback loops in complex systems should prevent them from choosing "the most obvious" intervention without considering unwanted side effects.The current study aims to report the effects of teaching a systems perspective, applied to transport systems, on students' opinions and expressed paradigms. The following questions are addressed: Do students adhere to the techno-centric paradigm, believing technology, innovation and growth can solve all types of threats for sustainable development, while neglecting low probability, high impact events? Are paradigms held by students coherent? Can teaching lead to a change in opinions and paradigms held by students? Design/methodology/approach - Measures for several systems concepts (i.e. functional stupidity, paradigms and fragility) are taken across a wide sample of university students. Posttests of some key items are taken for a subsample that followed a sustainability and systems perspective in a course on transport economics. Findings - A large share of students think that technology can solve different types of problems in sustainable development (a kind of weak sustainability), but their paradigms tend to be a mix of conflicting opinions. Though student opinions on topics that were explicitly treated in the course have changed, neither a wider paradigm shift nor significantly more coherent paradigms can be confirmed. Originality/value - The results show that even though students can be taught about the unwanted side effects and limitations on specific techno-fix interventions, this does not automatically translate into a critical mind-set toward techno-fixing in general.

It is based on the purpose to reach more productivity and results in mastering English by students for making them demanded specialists in modern multicultural world. The main attention is focused on the problem of creating foreign language environment in educational process. The purpose of using this teaching approach is to increase students' motivation to study foreign languages, reveal their communicator's creative potential, and overcome possible psychological and language barriers during the process of gaining all the necessary skills in foreign language communicative competence, which is based on developing speaking skills due to practice in real-life circumstances. The article reflects the problematic of such concepts as: "communicative competence", "foreign language communicative competence", "educational environment", "foreign language educational environment". The main components and functions of communicative competence are distinguished, as well as the key competences that form foreign language communicative competence to analyze the specifics of creating foreign language environment in educational process. The research proves that learning foreign language is not only knowledge of lexical and grammatical structure of a language, but it is also necessary to solve the problem of removing psychological and cultural barriers and shocks that always arise in the process of entering a new linguistic and cultural environment community. And creating foreign language educational environment, as a teaching approach if made appropriately, is able to lead to real improving students' success at gaining or developing foreign language communicative competence.

J	Hipkins, R; Bull, A				Hipkins, Rosemary; Bull, Ally			Science capabilities for a functional understanding of the nature of science	CURRICULUM MATTERS			English	Article							LITERACY	This article begins by making the case that the New Zealand curriculum component known as the Nature of Science (NOS) has generally not, thus far, achieved its stated intent of helping students think differently about science and its relevance to their lives. We argue that NOS components in curricula have tended to become positioned as additional content to be learned, at least partly as a consequence of well-meaning curriculum support initiatives that aim to build teachers' own NOS knowledge. The result is that NOS is added to an already overburdened curriculum, potentially making science even more abstract and inaccessible for some students than it already is. Having outlined the nature of the problem, we then describe a recent initiative that endeavoured to address the NOS challenge in a different way. We began by asking how a NOS focus might contribute to changes in teaching and learning that more deliberately focus on supporting students to build their science capabilities so that they can become the informed citizens that The New Zealand Curriculum (NZC) identifies as the overarching goal for science learning. This curriculum initiative introduces science capabilities as a set of ideas for teachers to think with. The capabilities were derived from the intersection of the generic key competencies in NZC, the NOS strand from the science learning area, and the NZC purpose statement for learning science, which emphasises citizenship. However, as we outline in the final section of the article, it is proving very hard to expand views of learning as content acquisition to include the participatory sensibility that the addition of capabilities implies. The idea of capabilities makes intuitive sense to teachers but using them as classroom prompts to think more deeply about NOS with their students is still a work in progress.

How medical students co-regulate their learning in clinical clerkships: a social network study	BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Self-regulated learning; Co-regulated learning; Social network study; Clinical clerkships; Medical education	SELF; EDUCATION; REFLECTION; PERCEIVE; SCHOOL	Background Self-regulated learning is a key competence to engage in lifelong learning. Research increasingly acknowledges that medical students in clerkships need others to regulate their learning. The concept of "co-regulated learning" captures this act of regulating one's learning by interacting with others. To effectively cultivate such skills in students, we need to increase our understanding of co-regulated learning. This study aimed to identify the purposes for which students in different phases of clinical training engage others in their networks to regulate their learning. Methods In this social network study, we administered a questionnaire to 403 medical students during clinical clerkships (65.5% response rate). The questionnaire probed into the composition of students' co-regulatory networks and the purpose for which they engaged others in specified self-regulated learning activities. We calculated the proportion of students that engaged others in their networks for each regulatory activity. Additionally, we conducted ANOVAs to examine whether first-, second-, and third-year students differed in how they used their networks to support self-regulation. Results Students used others within their co-regulatory networks to support a range of self-regulated learning activities. Whom students engaged, and the purpose of engagement, seemed to shift as students progressed through clinical training. Over time, the proportion of students engaging workplace supervisors to discuss learning goals, learning strategies, self-reflections and self-evaluations increased, whereas the proportion of students engaging peers to discuss learning strategies and how to work on learning goals in the workplace decreased. Of all purposes for which students engaged others measured, discussing self-reflections and self-evaluations were consistently among the ones most frequently mentioned. Conclusions Results reinforce the notion that medical students' regulation of learning is grounded in social interactions within co-regulatory networks students construct during clerkships. Findings elucidate the extent to which students enact self-regulatory learning within their co-regulatory networks and how their co-regulatory learning behaviors develop over time. Explicating the relevance of interactions within co-regulatory networks might help students and supervisors to purposefully engage in meaningful co-regulatory interactions. Additionally, co-regulatory interactions may assist students in regulating their learning in clinical workplaces as well as in honing their self-regulated learning skills.

J	Falcon, NF; Aubry, A				Falla Falcon, Nuria; Aubry, Anne			Legislation comparison on teaching of foreign languages in Basic Education according to the LOE and the LOMCE	IJERI-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION			English	Article						Communicative approach; foreign languages; LOE; LOMCE		The Decree of August 10, 2007 (normative development LOE) establishes that students had to learn only one foreign language with a class schedule which exceeded 4 hours per week in each of the cycles. However, the Decree of March 17, 2015 (normative development LOMCE) collects up to a second foreign language and with a direct teaching load of language lessons higher than twice the previous regulations. In addition, the curricular development map in this last law presents the evaluation criteria of each of the cycle and their relation to the rest of the curricular elements. It does not have as a reference the contents for the whole curriculum development, as in the LOE. In this respect, although the trend of teaching foreign languages in Andalusia follows very ambitious patterns through the development of their curricula from the LOE to the LOMCE, it prioritizes the development of skills at the expense of the accumulation of content. This teaching intent is a big step towards another dimension in the way of acquiring key competences.

The five key aspects of quality assessment for writing based on Lee's 37 study and Coombs's 14 socio-cultural conception of AL are used as a framework to analyze both student and teacher data, acknowledging the importance of including students' perspectives. Quantitative data, collected through a questionnaire answered by 105 English language students, were combined and compared with qualitative data from three EFL teachers. Data were analyzed in relation to the key competencies for writing assessment. On the whole, limited writing assessment skills of EFL teachers were suggested from the perspectives of both groups of stakeholders (i.e., students and teachers). More specifically, results revealed that students' report of the teachers' writing AL did not reflect the five key principles. A general need to enhance the socio-cultural aspect of writing AL among Iranian EFL teachers was highlighted as well.

The introduction of online learning technologies and the focus on independent and critical thinking actualizes the problem of developing these skills in future teachers and lawyers with the help of digital tools. The study looked at the critical thinking development in education while focusing on the use of digital tools in rational thinking formation in education. The research involved a random sample of under-graduate pedagogy students from [BLINDED] Institute of [BLINDED] University and graduate law students from [BLINDED] Institute. The digital tools were used to develop test tasks and logic problems, present information in graphical form, brainstorm, and collaborate in real-time to solve the created problems. The level of critical thinking development was assessed in dynamics using the method designed by Mishina based on the research Diane Halpern, Igor Zageshev, and Sergei Zair-Beck. The outcomes confirm the original hypothesis about the positive impact of digital tools on the formation of critical thinking in students.

J	Ojala, M				Ojala, Maria			Prefiguring sustainable futures? Young people's strategies to deal with conflicts about climate-friendly food choices and implications for transformative learning	ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						Education for sustainable development; climate change education; transformative learning; food activism; coping; prefigurative practice	HIGHER-EDUCATION; KEY COMPETENCES; PSYCHOLOGY; ACTIVISM; SELF	Transformative learning is important for handling climate change. How to include this kind of learning in formal education is, however, still debated. This article takes a bottom-up approach by learning from young people who make climate-friendly food choices to a high degree. Interviews were performed with Swedish adolescents. By focusing on conflicts and coping the aim was to explore if there are elements of prefigurative practice (e.g. to actualize ideals about the future in the here and now) in the young people's everyday engagement and to discuss how to utilize these to promote transformative learning. The young people experienced, for example, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and structural/practical conflicts. They coped in two overarching ways: strategies to support climate-friendly choices despite conflicts and strategies to deal with less good choices. It is argued that by critically discussing conflicts and different ways of dealing with them transformative learning can be promoted.

J	Sanders, W; McHugh, D				Sanders, William; McHugh, Douglas			Pre-Clerkship Medical Students' Experiences and Perspectives of System 1 and System 2 Thinking: A Qualitative Study	EDUCATION SCIENCES			English	Article						cognitive load; dual-process theory; heuristics; medical student; pre-clerkship; qualitative; self-regulation; System 1; System 2		Dual-process theories may be invoked to explain how physicians interact with, interpret, and draw inferences from clinical information. Stanovich and West's model articulates two kinds of thinking-intuitive-based System 1 and analytical-based System 2-which have been under-investigated with physicians in training. This qualitative study explored pre-clerkship medical students' retrospective perspectives and experiences of System 1 and System 2 thinking via 12 semi-structured interviews and abductive, progressive focusing. Participants identified patient interactions, clinical note writing, knowledge synthesis, problem list and differential diagnosis generation, evaluating evidence, and critical appraisal of literature as pre-clerkship opportunities to engage in System 1 or System 2 thinking. Six major themes emerged from analysis of participants' interview transcripts: cognitive processes, deliberate practice, learning environment: being alone or being together, stickiness factor, biases and heuristics, and prior experience of attaining competence. Participants valued the anticipated role that System 1 and System 2 thinking will play in their future practice, and experienced nascent, self-regulated development of these cognitive processes during the pre-clerkship phase of their education without formal feedback or coaching from clinician preceptors. Pre-clerkship curricula should further embrace low-stakes, incremental teaching on metacognition and continuous monitoring of knowledge processing as a key competency for physician learners.

The objective of the present study was to understand the important role played by schools, teaching staff and students involved in leisure and free-time courses with regards to digital competence. The research centred on the impact of the dimensions of this competence and their relevance for the construction of a competence profile in the sociocultural setting. A sample of 25 schools, 95 training providers and 350 students of supervised leisure and free-time courses distributed throughout Spain participated. A quantitative study was carried out which was descriptive and inferential in nature. Three ad hoc questionnaires were used to identify the extent of incorporation of digital competences, and to determine the knowledge and predisposition of professionals towards incorporating technologies into socio-cultural animation content and methodology. Amongst the main findings it is evidenced that, whilst the acquisition of digital competence is considered necessary at a general level, resistance can be seen to competency and methodological changes in the socio-cultural setting. Objection exists to the incorporation of technology through specific content and concrete methods, with the greatest resistance being seen on behalf of schools, followed by training providers and, finally, students on these courses.

J	Tassone, VC; Dik, G; van Lingen, TA				Tassone, Valentina C.; Dik, Giel; van Lingen, Thekla Anna			Empowerment for sustainability in higher education through the EYE learning tool	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Higher education; Sustainability; Agency; Social change; Transformative learning; Empowerment	KEY COMPETENCES; PSYCHOLOGY	Purpose - While empowerment for sustainability is considered a major objective within sustainability-oriented educational programs and policies, little is known about the actual process of empowering students for sustainability through higher education. This study aims to explore this field, by introducing the EYE (Educating Yourself in Empowerment) for Sustainability learning tool and by analyzing the effects of its application within a higher education context, including a reflection about key aspects contributing to students' empowerment for sustainability. Design/methodology/approach - The effects of the EYE tool are analyzed by means of questionnaires. Through a qualitative codification process and quantitative analysis, the authors have reflected on the effects of the EYE tool and on the empowerment process as perceived by the students exposed to the EYE at Wageningen University. Findings - Results suggest that the EYE is a comprehensive and adaptive tool, conducive to empowerment for sustainability. Adopting, only partly, an instrumental approach to education and, largely, an emancipatory one appears to be a possible and successful combination. Akey aspect contributing to students' empowerment for sustainability is the development and execution of a real-life project of own choice. Learning about the diverse worldviews underlying the search for sustainability appears to be an eye opener for the students. Empowerment does not seem to require long-term training. Rather, it emerges and is experienced by university students within a few weeks. Originality/value - This paper introduces a novel tool and discusses insights deriving from the application of this tool. The value of the paper lies in its potential to support educators in reflecting upon and designing their educational strategy for empowering students for sustainability.

J	Trad, SP				Trad, Sloan Peter			A framework for mapping sustainability within tertiary curriculum	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Case study; Graduate attributes; Curriculum assessment tool; Education for sustainable development competencies; Tertiary education for sustainable development	HIGHER-EDUCATION; KEY COMPETENCES	Purpose Sustainability within tertiary curriculum is hard to measure and often perceived to be illusive in nature. Existing higher education sustainability assessment tools rarely focus on the curriculum. This paper aims to establish and implement a tool that can measure sustainability integration within curriculum. The Faculty of Engineering and IT (FEIT) at University of Technology Sydney (UTS) is used as a case study. Design/methodology/approach A set of seven sustainability competencies are identified by means of a systematic literature review as the current knowledge of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) competencies. ESD competency integration into the curriculum is assessed by implementing a two-tier scanning mechanism. In the first step, subject outlines (SOs) are used to identify sustainable subject learning outcomes (SLOs) and assessment learning outcomes (ALOs). Step 2 involves analysing ALOs and SLOs for constructive alignment with student experience. SPSS, a statistical software, is then used to statistically reflect the results. Findings An initial scan of SOs found that stated ESD outcomes made up 22.4 per cent of FEIT undergraduate courses. A more detailed investigation which involved assessing subject material and student experience for the seven ESD outcomes resulted in a 7.7 per cent sustainability integration into the FEIT undergraduate courses. SPSS produced tables showing individual competency distribution over course candidature year. Lifecycle assessment was invisible from the curriculum. Research limitations/implications Case study outcomes are limited to UTS, and therefore, specific-study outcomes cannot be generalised. This study attempted to trace sustainability learning outcomes through the curriculum. However, a more detailed study should also assess subject pedagogy and artefacts as these may enable or inhibit sustainability competency. Originality/value Study developed several methods to establish and evaluate subject level ESD claims. Academic staff and management are able to replicate methods of this study to map ESD within their courses, schools and/or faculties triggering conversation around ESD's actual integration within curriculum. Based on ESD distribution, specific intervention recommendations are proposed.

J	Stupak, O				Stupak, Oksana			EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES IN TRAINING FUTURE MANAGERS	ADVANCED EDUCATION			English	Article						electronic resource; online game; WebQuest; higher education institutions; future managers		The introduction of educational technologies, which are developing at a rapid pace, requires professionalism and readiness of managers to implement the latest information technologies. Therefore, the use of electronic resources in the educational process in higher education can contribute both to developing professional skills and gaining the experience of using online environment. Purpose of the paper is to analyse the electronic educational resources and describe the process of implementing online games in future managers' training. Method. The survey on the use of electronic resources in the learning process is conducted among 50 Master students who study full-time and part-time to gain the speciality "Management". Online courses and tests developed with the help of electronic resources are the most popular among the students, while WebQuest, quizzes and online games are used only by a small number of respondents. The survey shows that the use of electronic resources is insufficient in future managers' training. Findings. Within the course "Information Systems and Technologies in Management of Organisation" an interactive online game on online platform Goosechase was developed. This resource can give the opportunity to fulfil assignments in the course by displaying photos and video materials, which contribute to involving participants into a team game and developing future managers' key competences in the course. Implications for research and practice. The results of this study allow to conclude that training of students is successful if an online game is used which can be adapted for various specialities and courses.

J	Drossel, K; Eickelmann, B				Drossel, Kerstin; Eickelmann, Birgit			Teachers' participation in professional development concerning the implementation of new technologies in class: a latent class analysis of teachers and the relationship with the use of computers, ICT self-efficacy and emphasis on teaching ICT skills	LARGE-SCALE ASSESSMENTS IN EDUCATION			English	Article						ICILS 2013; Professional development; New technologies; ICT skills; Teachers; Digital age		The increasing availability of new technologies in an ever more digitalized world has gained momentum in practically all spheres of life, making technology-related skills a key competence not only in professional settings. Thus, schools assume responsibility for imparting these skills to their students, and hence to future generations of professionals. In so doing, teachers play a key role with their competences in using new technologies constituting an essential prerequisite for the effective implementation of such skills. As models of school development and school effectiveness found teacher professionalization to be a key element with regards to student achievement as well as teachers' in-class use of new technology, the present research project conducts secondary analyses using data from the lEA International Computer and Information Literacy Study 2013 (ICILS 2013) regarding internal and external teacher professionalization. Particular emphasis is placed on the implementation of new technologies in class in a comparison between the education systems of Germany and the Czech Republic. A Latent Class Analysis serves the purpose of establishing a teacher typology with regards to technology-related professional development. This typology is subsequently used for further analyses of additional factors that show a correlation with the teachers' use of computers in class. These include the teachers' ICT self-efficacy and their emphasis on teaching ICT skills. The results show two different types of teachers across both countries. Teachers who participate in professional development use computers more frequently in class, put more emphasis on teaching ICT skills and have a stronger sense of ICT self-efficacy. When comparing teachers in Germany and the Czech Republic, teachers in Germany who participate in professional development consider themselves more ICT self-efficient, while teachers in the Czech Republic use computers more often and put more emphasis on teaching ICT skills compared with their colleagues in Germany.

J	Scherer, R; Tiemann, R				Scherer, Ronny; Tiemann, Ruediger			Factors of problem-solving competency in a virtual chemistry environment: The role of metacognitive knowledge about strategies	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Assessment; Complex problem solving; Interactivity; Scientific problem solving; Virtual reality	INTELLIGENCE; INQUIRY; COMPLEX; GAME; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION; SECONDARY; VALIDITY; QUESTION; SYSTEM	The ability to solve complex scientific problems is regarded as one of the key competencies in science education. Until now, research on problem solving focused on the relationship between analytical and complex problem solving, but rarely took into account the structure of problem-solving processes and metacognitive aspects. This paper, therefore, presents a theoretical framework, which describes the relationship between the components of problem solving and strategy knowledge. In order to assess the constructs, we developed a virtual environment which allows students to solve interactive and static problems. 162 students of grade 10 and the upper secondary level completed the tests within a cross-sectional survey. In order to investigate the structure of problem-solving competency, we established measurement models representing different theoretical assumptions, and evaluated model fit statistics by using confirmatory factor analyses. Results show that problem-solving competency in virtual environments comprises to three correlated abilities: achieving a goal state, systematical handling of variables, and solving analytical tasks. Furthermore, our study provides empirical evidence on the distinction between analytical and complex problem solving. Additionally, we found significant differences between students of grades 10 and 12 within the problem-solving subscales, which could be explained by gaming experience and prior knowledge. These findings are discussed from a measurement perspective. Implications for assessing complex problem solving are given. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hoskins, B; Crick, RD				Hoskins, Bryony; Crick, Ruth Deakin			Competences for Learning to Learn and Active Citizenship: different currencies or two sides of the same coin?	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION			English	Article						citizenship; learning to learn; competence; active citizenship; human rights; higher order thinking		In the context of the European Union Framework of Key Competences and the need to develop indicators for European Union member states to measure progress made towards the 'knowledge economy' and 'greater social cohesion' both the learning to learn and the active citizenship competences have been highlighted. However, what have yet to be discussed are the links and the overlaps between these two competences. Based on the development of research projects on these two fields, this article will compare the two sets of competences, both qualitatively and quantitatively. It will describe how the values and dispositions that motivate and inform active citizenship and learning to learn are related to each other, both empirically and theoretically. Both these competences are tools for empowering individuals and giving them the motivation and autonomy to control their own lives beyond the social circumstances in which they find themselves. In the case of active citizenship, the ability to be able to participate in society and voice their concerns, ensure their rights and the rights of others. In the case of learning to learn to be able to participate in work and everyday life by being empowered to learn and update the constantly changing competences required to successfully manage your life plans. When measuring both these competences then certain values relating positively towards democracy and human rights are common in their development.

J	Li, ZZ				Li, Zhenzhen			Critical thinking cultivation in Chinese learning classes for International students during the COVID-19 pandemic	THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY			English	Article						Chinese language; Competence; COVID-19; Critical thinking; Distance education; International students; Psychophysiological mechanism	SCHOOL EDUCATION; LANGUAGE	The COVID-19 pandemic has led to booming popularity of distance education, raising the question of ensuring critical thinking in students as one of the key competences. The present study aims to investigate how learning a Chinese language remotely affects the development of critical thinking in international students. The study took place in the Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, and involved comparing the levels of critical thinking in 233 international students learning Chinese remotely and 214 international students engaged in other areas and learning in their native language while training critical thinking, also remotely. The critical thinking assessment was carried out twice, at the beginning and at the end of the study, using the validated HEIghten (R) Critical Thinking Assessment suite in the native language of the respondents. The results of the study show that learning a Chinese language can facilitate the development of critical thinking in international students and that the low level of critical thinking among Chinese speakers is a myth. Future studies should focus more on exploring the psychophysiological predictors of critical thinking and developing valid psychodiagnostic techniques with regard to racial and ethnic characteristics of the psychophysiological mechanisms of cognition. In addition, the learning programs and training curricula aimed at critical thinking development must take into account the psychophysiology of learning.

J	Steffens, K				Steffens, Karl			Competences, Learning Theories and MOOCs: Recent Developments in Lifelong Learning	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION			English	Article						competences; connectivism; generativism; lifelong learning; MOOCs; technology enhanced learning	EDUCATION; VOICES	Our societies have come to be known as knowledge societies in which lifelong learning is becoming increasingly important. In this context, competences have become a much discussed topic. Many documents were published by international organisations (UNESCO, World Bank, European Commission) which enumerated 21(st) century key competences. The field of learning theories has also experienced advances. Findings from neuroscience have promoted a new understanding of what really happens in the brain when we learn. At the same time, the fact that learning increasingly takes place in virtual communities led George Siemens (2004) to propose connectivism as a learning theory for the digital age. Similarly, Roberto Carneiro (2010) suggested a theory he called generativism which aims at describing collaborative learning with digital technologies and open educational resources. These theories might be better able to describe and explain lifelong learning than classical learning theories. In the field of digital technologies, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have recently received a great deal of attention. While Siemens suggested connectivist MOOCs (cMOOCs) as the ideal platform for connectivist learning, other forms of MOOCs were also developed. These MOOCs have spread at a breath-taking pace in the last few years, although it is far from clear to what extent they are based on principles from learning theories and really support learning. These developments will be presented and discussed with respect to their relevance for lifelong learning as an integral part of man's quest for meaning.

"It's more than stick and rudder skills': an aviation professional development community of practice	TEACHING IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						aviation; community of practice; professional development; professional identity; undergraduates		In Australian higher education institutions, benchmarks have been directed at developing key competencies and attributes to facilitate students' transition into the workforce. However, for those students whose degree has a specific vocational focus, it is also necessary for them to commence their professional development whilst undergraduates. Familiarising students with the norms and culture of their chosen profession often does not occur through passive observation of subject content. At Griffith University in an undergraduate aviation degree, a community of practice has been established by the school, which develops student's generic skills and their identity as novice professionals. Our research examines the ways in which Mentoring Aviators Through Educational Support (MATES) provides students with the opportunity to develop their professional competence and experience through connecting with other undergraduates and industry professionals.

Applying the Ideas of the Developmental Teaching at the Foreign Language Lessons to Develop Students' Communicative Competence	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION			English	Article						developmental teaching; communicative competence; personality; lexical skill; project		Foreign language lessons at school are designed to form key competences, with communicative competence being an important one, implying students' ability and readiness to communicate in a foreign language. However, there are difficulties in mastering the foreign language. As before, the main ones are: the lack of active oral practice, the absence of the environment for foreign language communication, and the presentation of educational material in textbooks without taking into account the principle of individualization and differentiation of education. The solution to this problem is possible through applying the ideas of developmental teaching at the lesson. The purpose of this study is to substantiate theoretically and test experimentally the effectiveness of using the ideas of developmental learning at the foreign language lessons to develop students' communicative competence. The leading method of the research is a pedagogical experiment aimed at revealing the level of the development of students' communicative competence. The content analysis of foreign language textbooks was also used to identify potential options to apply ideas of developmental learning. Results of the research: The article presents a selection of topical projects aimed at students' partially exploring and research activities that form the communicative competence directly; there were developed lessons to introduce the ideas of the developmental teaching at the lesson. It is proved that the projects assembled in the textbook contribute to building interdisciplinary connections, stimulate the development of the communicative competence and, on the whole, favour the development of the student's personality. Relevance of the study: The study proved the effectiveness of using the ideas of the developmental teaching to develop students' communicative competence. The materials of the article can be used to improve the process of teaching the foreign language at the secondary school; developed and tested different topical projects can be used by teachers of the foreign language in class.

J	Hinostroza, JE; Labbe, C; Matamala, C				Hinostroza, J. Enrique; Labbe, Christian; Matamala, Carolina			The use of computers in preschools in Chile: Lessons for practitioners and policy designers	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Computers in preschools; Computers use in the classroom; Improving classroom teaching	TECHNOLOGY; SETTINGS; ICT	This paper presents the results of survey of the availability and use of computers in a preschool sample in Chile, and compares them with similar results of primary and secondary schools. Results show that although preschools have relatively low access to computers and teachers have relatively low ICT competencies, they declare similar ICT related obstacles and impacts compared to their colleagues in secondary schools. Also, results show that preschool students seem to use computers in the classroom more frequently than their peers in primary and secondary schools and that the activities they implement are focused on developing key curriculum related areas implementing tasks that can be associated to the exercising of key competencies and skills. This specialised use of computers in preschools, which is much more focused than the activities with computers reported by teachers in higher levels, could be explained by the relative low variety of educational software available in these preschools, the availability of the computers in the classroom rather than in labs: the special type of teaching and learning activities implemented at this age level and/or due to the relative lack of teachers' ICT competencies. On the one hand, these results highlight the need for further research, and on the other, it constitutes an interesting lesson for policy designer that tend to advocate for considering computers as "multipurpose" technologies that should be used across subjects, levels and teaching strategies. In this case, computers seem to play a very specific and concrete role in preschools classrooms that, eventually, contributes to improve students' outcomes, which highlights the potential of considering the use of computers, software and other technologies to improve specific subject areas at particular levels while designing ICT in education policies for this age group.

Design/methodology/approach - The pedagogical model is based on the principles of education for sustainable development and focuses on the establishment of a repeatable platform for dialogue between students and mentors, members of the mentoring team, the local community, external members of the consulting team of experts and foreign master's degree programmes, in the process of producing students' projects. The proposed method addresses several dimensions, including: the education of students, teachers, professionals and local experts, the establishment of a network for cooperation and collaboration and the delivery of practical and usable results. Findings - The paper provides a comparative overview of the pedagogical model's application in producing the final master's degree projects of three generations of students, as well as its alignment with the needs of re-defining the role and reach of the profession of urban planner in an environment of post-socialist transition. The model was improved, enhanced and optimised through this process and then corroborated with its practical implementation. Originality/value - The innovative pedagogical model comprises an instrument to enhance the professional capacities of all participants in the production of final master's projects: academics, practitioners and future professionals/students, through discussions of topical issues, innovative modes of work and new professional responses grounded in the local context and tested by a broad range of stakeholders. It is of particular importance for countries in transition experiencing a shift in the paradigm of professional action, especially as the proposed pedagogical model establishes a problem-solving platform that surpasses academia.

J	Batista, BF; Andrade, AI				Batista, Bruna Fonseca; Andrade, Ana Isabel			Educating for Biocultural Diversity and Sustainable Development in First Years of Schooling: An Analysis of Documents From the Portuguese Educational System	FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION			English	Article						education for biocultural diversity; education for sustainable development; first years of schooling; elementary education; Portuguese educational system; sustainable development goals	KEY COMPETENCES	Educating for sustainable development can encompass different perspectives and possibilities that enable the achievement of the goals of (more) sustainable development, as predicted by the United Nations for 2030. This type of education also involves a humanist and citizenship education, which can prepare children, youth, and adults to face current and future challenges, local and global, as actors in building a better future. We believe, however, that for education to bear fruit, it is important that children, from the first years of schooling (primary education), can be in contact with different perspectives, people, ways of learning, and worldviews, locally contextualized and relevant, with strong links to the natural and social environment involving their communities, such as education must value linguistic and cultural diversity, without forgetting biodiversity and the influences they exert on the education of individuals. Thus, looking at an education that encompasses the relationships among linguistic, cultural (stories, celebrations, heritage, artefacts, relationships, and behaviors between people, etc.), and biological diversity, the present study aimed to understand how biocultural diversity is present in the main normative-legal documents that govern education for the first years of schooling in the Portuguese educational system and, above all, if its existence is considered in education for sustainable development. For this study, seven guiding documents of the Portuguese educational system, and primary education in particular (education that includes the interval from the 1st to the 4th year and the average age-groups of 5-10 years of age), were analyzed, and the results show a gap regarding the presence of biocultural diversity, which points to an incomplete perspective of education for sustainable development, forgetting languages, cultures, and individuals.

This study describes the development of a copyleft psychoeducational instrument based on the model posited by Arnau et al. (2014) that Social Pedagogy professionals can use to evaluate the basic employability competences in adolescents and young people aged 12 to 18: The Situational Test of Basic Employability Competences Development (DCBE). A total of 29 problem situations were designed and included within five stories related to the daily life of any adolescent. A total of 102 adolescents and young people were interviewed and asked how they would react to these problem situations. The responses were subjected to a content analysis in order to select the most frequent responses indicative of different levels of competence development. Ten experts then assigned the problem situations to one of the eight competences proposed by Arnau et al. (2014), before assigning scores of 0 to 5 to the different responses based on the level of development indicated by the responses, with high levels of agreement. Following a pilot study on a group of 47 young people to verify the variability of the responses, the test was administered to 1,011 young people at six training centres. A factor analysis of the responses yielded a unifactorial structure of 23 items, with high values for model fit and reliability. The results obtained support the content, ecological and construct validity of the DCBE test, which was well accepted by both students and teachers for its attractiveness and usefulness. The test makes it possible to begin preparing students for employment in the early stages prior to post-compulsory training. Its copyleft nature means it can be widely used by Social Pedagogy professionals.

The present study considers an understanding of the nature of science (NOS) to be one of the key competences that citizens should acquire as part of their science education. Hence, our aim was to identify NOS aspects among the key scientific competences for citizenship identified by a panel of Spanish experts. The analysis is based on a review of the recent literature on the NOS, and especially on the results of a previous Delphi study in which 31 experts were asked to propose key aspects of scientific competence for citizenship. The present study involved three stages: identification of NOS themes in the experts' initial proposals, analysis of how their importance ratings of these themes changed over the course of the Delphi rounds, and analysis of variability among the experts according to their professional group. We identified 12 NOS themes that, in line with recent publications in this field, included those related to the practice of science. A stable consensus was only observed for one theme: critical attitude. These results provide further evidence of the well-documented difficulty of defining and selecting NOS themes. However, the analysis also suggests that critical attitude is one of the key themes that should form part of science education for citizens.

J	Russell, E; Rowlett, P				Russell, Ewan; Rowlett, Peter			Professional skills development for mathematics undergraduates	HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING			English	Article						Mathematics; Employability; Project-based learning; Graduate skills; Module design		Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe the design and development of a final year undergraduate mathematics module designed to address professional skills development at a UK university, including via input to curriculum and assessment from employers, and to investigate student acquisition of skills from this module. Design/methodology/approach Literature on skills development in mathematics informs module design and development. Students optionally completed Likert-style competency questionnaires before and after the taught module content, and reflected on skills development via an end of module questionnaire. Data collection took place over three academic years. Findings Several key competencies exhibit median increases over the course of the module in each academic year, indicating a perceived skills development. Problem solving and presentation skills are particularly highlighted. Research limitations/implications - Numbers of students were small, though the study is repeated with three different cohorts. Some students study mathematics jointly with another discipline and hence may have experience in skills development from the other subject. Practical implications - This study indicates that innovations in teaching style and assessment in mathematics modules can enhance student confidence and competence with key professional skills. Originality/value Undergraduate modules in mathematics which have a focus on professional skills development are still fairly rare in UK universities. Often such modules do not embed the professional skills development activities with subject-specific technical tasks and projects as this module does. There are few formal studies of the effectiveness of this style of module, especially longitudinal studies covering several academic years.

As in other countries, a medical residency is not obligatory to practice as a doctor. In this context, this paper aims to clarify what and when competencies in communication and professionalism should be addressed, shedding light on the role of university, residency and post-residency programmes. Methods: Brazilian family physicians with diverse levels of medical training answered a questionnaire designed to seek a consensus on the competencies that should be taught (key competencies) and when students should achieve them during their medical training. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and correlation tests. Results: A total of seventy-four physicians participated; nearly all participants suggested that the students should achieve communication and professionalism competencies during undergraduate study (twenty out of thirty competencies - 66.7%) or during residency (seven out of thirty competencies - 23.33%). When competencies were analysed in domains, the results were that clinical communication skills and professionalism competencies should be achieved during undergraduate medical education, and interpersonal communication and leadership skills should be reached during postgraduate study. Conclusion: The authors propose that attainment of clinical communication skills and professionalism competencies should be required for undergraduate students. The foundation for Leadership and Interpersonal Abilities should be particularly formed at an undergraduate level and, furthermore, mastered by immersion in the future workplace and medical responsibilities in residency.

J	Klug, J; Bruder, S; Schmitz, B				Klug, Julia; Bruder, Simone; Schmitz, Bernhard			Which variables predict teachers diagnostic competence when diagnosing students' learning behavior at different stages of a teacher's career?	TEACHERS AND TEACHING			English	Article						reflection on experience; Diagnosing; knowledge; motivation; competence	SELF-EFFICACY; INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY; ACCURACY; JUDGMENTS; PRESERVICE	Diagnosing is one of teachers' key competences. Lately, a new model of teachers' diagnostic competence and therewith a new measurement method focusing on diagnosing students' learning behavior in an interdisciplinary approach have been developed. They can build a basis for promoting teachers' diagnostic competence. However, some questions relevant to promoting teachers' diagnostic competence concerning students' learning behavior still remain unanswered: Which values do teachers-on-the-job in contrast to preservice teachers with or without teaching experience gain through experience and which are the relevant variables that lead to a high level of diagnostic competence focused on learning behavior? Thus, this study aims at enlightening these issues. In a sample of 293 participants (93 German grammar school teachers, 107 German teacher students in their second phase of teacher education, and 93 German preservice students in their first phase of teacher education), teachers' diagnostic competence concerning learning behavior as well as teachers' motivation, attitude, self-efficacy, knowledge, and reflection on experience concerning diagnosing was measured. Motivation, attitude, and knowledge were found to be substantial positive predictors of diagnostic competence concerning learning behavior, with differentiated predictions for teachers' experience. Reflection on experience and self-efficacy unexpectedly was not found to be relevant. Teachers-on-the-job were generally better at diagnosing their students' learning behavior than were preservice teachers without teaching experience. However, the diagnostic work of preservice teachers with teaching experience was as credible as that of the in-service teachers.

J	Remington-Doucette, S; Musgrove, S				Remington-Doucette, Sonya; Musgrove, Sheryl			Variation in sustainability competency development according to age, gender, and disciplinary affiliation Implications for teaching practice and overall program structure	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Assessment; Curriculum development; Sustainability competencies; Sustainability education; Transdisciplinary	INTERPERSONAL SKILLS; SYSTEMS-THINKING; REAL-WORLD; EDUCATION; FUTURES; FRAMEWORK; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; LESSONS; ORIGINS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a classroom assessment aimed at determining the extent to which five key sustainability competencies develop in students during an introductory transdisciplinary sustainability course. University sustainability programs intend to provide integrated education that fosters the key competencies students need to solve real-world sustainability problems. Translating sustainability competencies into effective pedagogical practice in integrated academic programs is not straightforward. This work builds on a previous study by both expanding the competencies evaluated and considering additional demographic characteristics. Design/methodology/approach - The paper summarizes previously identified key sustainability competencies and describes teaching methodologies used to foster these competencies in students. Development of competencies in students during a semester-long course is assessed using a pre-/post-test based on two case studies. The implications of the findings for teaching practice and overall program structure are discussed. Findings - Based on the assessment methods used here, four of the five sustainability competencies evaluated in this study developed differently in students according to gender, disciplinary affiliation and age. Females improved interpersonal competence more than males. Systems thinking competence improved for students associated with the three disciplinary affiliations considered in this study: sustainability major, sustainability minor and business major. Anticipatory competence improved for sustainability and business majors only, but not for students minoring in sustainability and majoring in other disciplines. Finally, normative competence improved for younger students only. Research limitations/implications - Insights for teaching practice and overall program structure are based on assessment of one introductory transdisciplinary sustainability course. Much additional work is needed to draw strong conclusions about general teaching practices and program structure for sustainability education. This study provides a flexible and field-tested rubric for further evaluative work in other sustainability courses or degree programs. Practical implications - Universities incorporate sustainability into their undergraduate curricula in many ways, ranging from certificates to entire degree programs focused on sustainability. The results of this study suggest that educators pay attention to gender diversity, classroom teaching practices, disciplinary perspectives and student attitudes and developmental stages as they figure outhow to make sustainability part of undergraduate education. This information may help create more effective sustainability courses and academic programs, which may maintain the viability of current sustainability programs and promote the institutionalization of sustainability in higher education. Originality/value - This research contributes to undergraduate sustainability education by providing insight into how sustainability education might thoughtfully be integrated into academic programs. It also offers an assessment approach for use by other sustainability educators to evaluate effectiveness of teaching practice and overall program structure based on five key sustainability competencies commonly cited in the literature.

Knowledge is not enough to solve the problems - The role of diagnostic knowledge in clinical reasoning activities	BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Medical problem-solving; Metacognition; Knowledge categories; Clinical reasoning; Diagnostic reasoning	SELF-EXPLANATION; WORKED EXAMPLES; PERFORMANCE; COGNITION; PROMPTS	Background: Clinical reasoning is a key competence in medicine. There is a lack of knowledge, how non-experts like medical students solve clinical problems. It is known that they have difficulties applying conceptual knowledge to clinical cases, that they lack metacognitive awareness and that higher level cognitive actions correlate with diagnostic accuracy. However, the role of conceptual, strategic, conditional, and metacognitive knowledge for clinical reasoning is unknown. Methods: Medical students (n = 21) were exposed to three different clinical cases and instructed to use the think-aloud method. The recorded sessions were transcribed and coded with regards to the four different categories of diagnostic knowledge (see above). The transcripts were coded using the frequencies and time-coding of the categories of knowledge. The relationship between the coded data and accuracy of diagnosis was investigated with inferential statistical methods. Results: The use of metacognitive knowledge is correlated with application of conceptual, but not with conditional and strategic knowledge. Furthermore, conceptual and strategic knowledge application is associated with longer time on task. However, in contrast to cognitive action levels the use of different categories of diagnostic knowledge was not associated with better diagnostic accuracy. Conclusions: The longer case work and the more intense application of conceptual knowledge in individuals with high metacognitive activity may hint towards reduced premature closure as one of the major cognitive causes of errors in medicine. Additionally, for correct case solution the cognitive actions seem to be more important than the diagnostic knowledge categories.

J	O'Rafferty, S; Curtis, H; O'Connor, F				O'Rafferty, Simon; Curtis, Hannah; O'Connor, Frank			Mainstreaming sustainability in design education - a capacity building framework	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Curriculum; Sustainability; Capacity building; Design education; Ecodesign		Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to advance the understanding of the role design education plays in sustainable development. It presents a capacity building framework that can be accommodated in various levels of design curriculum development. The framework allows for a macro-view on the key clusters of competencies for ecodesign while allowing for alignment with quantitative and qualitative approaches to evaluation and assessment The proposed framework does not intend to be universally prescriptive, and it should provide a context for the development bespoke educational programmes and activities. Design/methodology/approach - The research utilises a variety of data sources and methods to provide answers to the research questions. Empirical data were collected through the course of a two-year programme of capacity building with design educators in Wales. This two-year programme incorporated a series of workshops and scoping discussions with teaching staff. Additional data were collected through a literature review and best practice scanning. Thus, the research did not follow a linear process. Instead, it was performed according to an iterative process, evolved by interaction between a theoretical foundation (capacity building, ecodesign education) and empirical material (workshops, literature review). Findings - Design education may need to situate itself away from the traditional art or engineering setting to facilitate greater interdisciplinary learning. This repositioning of design education will allow for multidisciplinary relationships with other schools and communities such as social science, business or planning. There will be a role for the promotion of international design institutes that provide a more concentrated experience of the value of design and design education. Research limitations/implications - This paper sought to explore the context of capacity for sustainable development as it relates to design education. It briefly highlighted some gaps in the literature on capacity building for ecodesign education along with proposing a conceptual framework of key competencies. The intention is to initiate a discussion on the means by which these can be integrated into mainstream design education, lifelong learning and entrepreneurship training. Originality/value - There is no similar framework presented in the literature. Much of the research originates from original research conducted with four universities in a unique programme of capacity building. The paper provides the basis for deeper insights into the interdisciplinary perspectives required. This is something the authors hope to report on this year.

J	Takala, A; Korhonen-Yrjanheikki, K				Takala, Annina; Korhonen-Yrjaenheikki, Kati			A decade of Finnish engineering education for sustainable development	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Finland; Sustainable development; Engineers; Collaborative learning; Engineering education		Purpose The paper aims to examine the current status and development of sustainable development in Finnish engineering education. Design/methodology/approach The study consists of interviews with key stakeholders supplemented with the analysis of documented material. Development is discussed in relation to the findings of collaborative strategy process in the year 2009. Findings The paper observes that the Finnish universities providing engineering education are committed to sustainable development in their strategies. However, a lot of work remains to be done before the strategies are implemented and sustainable development is integrated to all degree programs. Explicit knowledge and individual learning in clearly defined disciplinary boundaries have been the main focus of engineering education. Practical implications The paper suggests that engineers need to be provided with mental tools to cope with uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. Key competencies include holistic understanding, communication and collaboration skills, ability and willingness for critical and reflective thinking, creativity, innovativeness and entrepreneurship. Thus, collaborative learning, open dialogue and innovation are at the heart of education for sustainable development. Originality/value This paper has a relatively wide approach as it analyses sustainable development in the context of Finnish engineering education both on institutional and societal levels and is based on a national project.

The effect of telecollaboration in the development of the Learning to Learn competence in CLIL teacher training	INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article; Early Access						Preservice teacher education; telecollaboration; ICT; CLIL; learning to learn; reflective practice	LANGUAGE TEACHERS; PRESERVICE; KNOWLEDGE; PROJECTS	One of the main aims of diverse education systems is the development of key competences to improve citizens' capacity for lifelong learning. However, some authors have signalled the challenge their measurement entails, among them the Learning to Learn (LtL) competence, which has also been shown to be complex to define and is under research. With a pre-post-test design and a variety of assessment instruments, this study compares the effect having an educational technology course and using telecollaboration has on the development of the LtL competence in a content and language integrated (CLIL) learning environment. Four groups of teacher trainees at two different universities took initial and after treatment surveys on LtL. Quantitative and qualitative data analysis indicated that technology boosts LtL but that telecollaboration helps develop LtL reflective concepts further in the form of processes by constructing or accomplishing learning goals in similar contexts.

J	Okiror, JJ; Hayward, G; Winterbottom, M				Okiror, John James; Hayward, Geoff; Winterbottom, Mark			Towards in-service training needs of secondary school agriculture teachers in a paradigm shift to outcome-based education in Uganda	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION & EXTENSION			English	Article						In-service training needs; secondary schools; agriculture; Uganda		Purpose: This paper examines the in-service teacher training needs of secondary school agriculture teachers in Uganda as the country moves towards an 'outcome-based' education by removal of subjects and instead, uses learning areas, presenting a need for new pedagogical skills among teachers. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Uganda between June and September 2016 to assess the teaching methods and teacher training needs for secondary school agriculture curriculum. Data were collected from 80 agriculture teachers and 57 administrators from 60 secondary schools, randomly drawn from 25 districts in Uganda. The data were analysed with descriptive statistics. Findings: The findings show that there about 10 key competences required by the teachers to thrive in their profession. These range from traditional classroom teaching to community outreach and linkages with agribusinesses which is in tandem with outcomebased education beyond the classroom walls. Respondents highlight lack of practical agriculture skills and exposure to the modern farming practices. Theoretical implications: This paper examines role of formal inservice teacher training based on theory of change and proposes using professional learning communities for school-level improvements. Practical implication: The results were not significant enough to warrant strong recommendations. However, they suffice to highlight a growing need for in-service teacher support mechanism for a dynamic subject like agriculture using communities of practice at school and district levels. Originality/value: In the current context of growing concern for unemployment in Africa, secondary schools will require competent teachers to engage students into transferable learning, given that it is the terminal level of education for majority.

J	Parkes, M; Reading, C; Stein, S				Parkes, Mitchell; Reading, Christine; Stein, Sarah			The competencies required for effective performance in a university e-learning environment	AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								by students for effective performance in a university e-learning environment mediated by a learning management system. Two expert panels identified 58 e-learning competencies considered to be essential for e-learning. Of these competencies, 22 were related to the use of technology. The remaining 36 competencies encapsulated a range of practices considered to be essential for learning within a social constructivist framework. Six of the competencies identified were either new or substantially different from what had been previously identified in the literature. A survey of e-learning stakeholders rating the importance of the e-learning competencies indicated that the competencies were not of equal importance. Critically, a number of key competencies from a social constructivist perspective that dealt with interacting and working with others were rated as being unimportant. This suggests that there is a disconnect between what the literature says about the importance of social constructivism to e-learning environments in theory and what e-learning stakeholders perceive its importance to be in practice.

Social enterprise, innovation and entrepreneurship are key competences that have been used by the university to address social inequalities. This paper will account for the social engagement challenges that are influential in the UK's higher educational environment. International perspectives will be highlighted to demonstrate that significant advantages can be obtained by borrowing and adapting policies and practice strategies. Our primary aims are: to showcase the fundamental activities of social responsibility as demonstrated by UoN and provide examples of stakeholder demands during periods of significant change. We argue that it is essential for higher education institutions (HEI) to develop a more nuanced and innovative examination of community based initiatives and networks in order to sustain engagement and access.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						Engineering education; sustainable development; SDGs; engineering competences	HIGHER-EDUCATION; KEY COMPETENCES; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; STRATEGIES; INTEGRATION; FRAMEWORK; SKILLS	Despite the emerging discussions about the growing role of engineers in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there is a lack of agreement on which competences should be prioritised to prepare engineering students to resolve future sustainability challenges. This study examined and compared the views of key stakeholders of engineering education (Academics, Employers and Students) using twelve focus groups in Denmark, Finland, France and Ireland. The findings were mapped against competences identified in previous studies to highlight gaps and opportunities for development. The results confirm the strong emphasis on normative, strategic and systems thinking competences in engineering. However, the outcomes also lack acknowledgement of anticipatory competence, contradicting the future oriented perspective required to achieve sustainable development.

Preservice teachers' views about the twenty-first century skills: A qualitative survey study in Turkey and Sweden	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Twenty-first century skills; Twenty-first century learning; Digital competences; Key competences; Preservice teachers	TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION; BELIEFS; CLASSROOM; BARRIERS	The purpose of this study was to investigate the views of preservice teachers from Turkey and Sweden about twenty-first century skills. The participants of the study were 197 preservice teachers from universities in Turkey and Sweden. In the study, the views of preservice teachers about twenty-first century skills were investigated with an open-ended questionnaire, and the collected qualitative data were analysed using a content analysis method. The findings indicate that within the context of daily life, the preservice teachers from both countries associated twenty-first century skills mostly with technology, digital citizenship, communication, and information literacy. Within the context of education, a great majority of the preservice teachers from Turkey associated twenty-first century skills with information literacy and technology, while those from Sweden associated twenty-first century skills mostly with technology, distance learning and communication. In addition, it was seen that among the skills considered by the preservice teachers from both countries to be necessary for their careers and for their future students, they all put most emphasis on digital literacy. However, as the second most frequent skills, the preservice teachers from Turkey emphasized critical thinking and problem solving skills, while the preservice teachers from Sweden mentioned communication skills and information literacy.

J	Sime, JA; Themelis, C				Sime, Julie-Ann; Themelis, Chryssa			Educators' perspectives on transmedia identity management: Redefining tele-teacher presence	DISTANCE EDUCATION			English	Article						teacher competence; identity; visual literacy; community of inquiry; teaching presence; tele-proximity theory	SOCIAL PRESENCE; ONLINE	Visual media and virtual reality are now a common features of distance education environments. This has boosted research into questions surrounding visual media and technologies for educators' professional development and teaching practice. This research explored educators' views on identity and teaching presence in visual media in distance education. We interviewed 18 experienced educators and categorized their views on identity and visual media. The findings suggest that digital identity can be seen through the lens of networks with others, and that transmedia identity management, which we define as the ability to create and manage multiple identities across different technology platforms, is a key competence for online educators as a means of building trust within online learning communities. As a result, we modified the theory of tele-proximity (Themelis, 2013, 2014; Themeli & Bougia, 2016) by refining its concept of tele-teacher presence to include transmedia identity management. The implications for practice are that the professional development of online educators should include knowledge and competence in tele-teacher presence and especially transmedia identity management.

The study, which was based on a case study of Renewable Energy involving six countries in Southern Africa, was based on established methodologies proposed by previous studies on harmonisation and profiling of higher education programmes. The study uses a general curriculum development approach leading to the definition of generic and specific competencies and feeding into a learning taxonomy to create alignment with specific learning outcomes at the intended qualification level. However, the approach extends the harmonisation concept to include industrialisation potential, which is crucial in the developing-country context. This allows for the exploitation of shared resources in sector-specific technology areas and supports the development of regional standards on technology and practice, as part of developing a sustainable regional economic sector. Twenty-two competencies, encompassing both generic and specific competencies, were defined. These competencies were grouped into six key competence areas, and later transformed into four clusters of competencies: core competencies, hard skills, soft skills and attitudes. These four clusters were then placed on a planetary system to represent the meta-profile for the qualification, which forms the framework for the future design of learning materials for the qualification.

J	Ophoff, JG; Wolf, R; Schladitz, S; Wirtz, M				Ophoff, Jana Gross; Wolf, Raffaela; Schladitz, Sandra; Wirtz, Markus			Assessment of Educational Research Literacy in Higher Education: Construct validation of the factorial structure of an assessment instrument comparing different treatments of omitted responses	JOURNAL FOR EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ONLINE-JERO			English	Article						Educational Research Literacy; Higher education; Competency tests; Dimensional analysis; Missing data	MISSING DATA; PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; STATISTICAL-MODEL; STUDENTS; KNOWLEDGE; COMPETENCES; VALIDITY; SKILLS; INTERVENTION; RELIABILITY	The ability to purposefully access, reflect, and use evidence from educational research (Educational Research Literacy) are key competencies of future professionals in educational practice. A test instrument was developed to assess Educational Research Literacy with the competence facets Information Literacy, Statistical Literacy, and Evidence-based Reasoning. Even though there are certain overlaps with generic concepts like critical thinking or problem solving, Educational Research Literacy is acquired within its reference disciplines. This contribution aimed to delve deeper into the question which factorial model is most appropriate. Four competing models were compared: unidimensional, three-dimensional, and two bifactor models. The comparison was based on a study of 1360 students at six German universities and was validated by another study of 753 students at three universities. The results also were examined relative to the scoring of omitted responses and the booklet design used in the first study. The results indicate that the four-dimensional bifactor model was the most appropriate: Educational Research Literacy seems to consist of one dominant factor and three secondary factors. The results also support handling both omitted and not-reached responses as missing information. Subsequently, the results are critically discussed relative to the requirements for assessing and for imparting competencies in higher education. Recommendations for future research are stated.

A pilot study of a practice management training module for medical residents	BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Medical residents; Management training; Competency; Postgraduate curriculum	TEACHING PRACTICE MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS-BASED PRACTICE; HEALTH-CARE; CURRICULUM; EDUCATION; LEADERSHIP; PHYSICIAN; PROGRAM; COMPETENCE; PERCEIVE	Background: In 2005 a competency based curriculum was introduced in the Dutch postgraduate medical training programs. While the manager's role is one of the seven key competencies, there is still no formal management course in most postgraduate curricula. Based on a needs assessment we conducted, several themes were identified as important for a possible management training program. We present the results of the pilot training we performed to investigate two of these themes. Methods: The topics "knowledge of the healthcare system" and "time management" were developed from the list of suggested management training themes. Fourteen residents participated in the training and twenty-four residents served as control. The training consisted of two sessions of four hours with a homework assignment in between. 50 True/false-questions were given as pre- and post-test to both the test and control groups to assess the level of acquired knowledge among the test group as well as the impact of the intervention. We also performed a qualitative evaluation using evaluation forms and in-depth interviews. Results: All fourteen residents completed the training. Six residents in the control group were lost to follow up. The pre-and post-test showed improvement among the participating residents in comparison to the residents from the control group, but this improvement was not significant. The qualitative assessment showed that all residents evaluated the training positively and experienced it as a useful addition to their training in becoming a medical specialist. Conclusion: Our training was evaluated positively and considered to be valuable. This study supports the need for mandatory medical management training as part of the postgraduate medical curriculum. Our training could be an example of how to teach two important themes in the broad area of medical management education.

A cluster-randomized study in undergraduate medical students	BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Framing; Expectation; Placebo; Risk communication; Risk literacy; Statistics anxiety; Learning barriers	COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; STATISTICS ANXIETY; MEMORY; COMMUNICATION; IMPACT	Background Risk literacy, i.e., the ability to calculate and apply risk parameters, represents a key competence for risk communication and medical decision making. However, risk literacy is reportedly low in medical students. The successful acquisition of statistical competencies is often difficult, and can be hampered by emotional learning obstacles, calling for interventions to support learning. In this cluster-randomized study, we aimed to translate findings from placebo research to medical education. Specifically, we tested if the acquisition of risk literacy during a seminar unit can be facilitated by positive expectations, induced by a positive and non-threatening framing of the content and learning goals. Methods The study took place during a mandatory 2.5-h seminar on "risk literacy" for 2(nd) year medical students. The seminar teaches both statistical knowledge and its application in patient communication. To test the effects of expectations on risk literacy acquisition, the (otherwise identical) seminar was framed either as "communication training" (positive framing condition) or "statistics seminar" (negative framing condition). All N = 200 students of the semester were invited to participate, and cluster-randomized to the positive or negative framing condition (4 seminar groups each condition). Risk literacy was assessed with the "Quick Risk Test" (QRT) at the beginning and end of the seminar, along with statistics anxiety and subjective learning success using questionnaires. Results Data from N = 192 students were included. At the end of the seminar, risk literacy was increased in both framing conditions, with a significantly greater increase in QRT scores in the positive framing condition. Statistics anxiety was significantly decreased in both framing conditions, with no evidence of group differences. Subjective learning success was overall high and comparable between groups. Conclusions Supporting our hypothesis, positive framing led to a significantly greater increase in risk literacy (i.e., in QRT scores). Our data offer first support that positive framing of learning goals may help to facilitate the acquisition of statistical knowledge. Expectation-orientated interventions may thus offer a feasible tool to optimize learning settings and framing of learning objectives in medical statistics courses.

In a comparative case study, this paper investigates how individual ESD courses in teacher education programs at Leuphana University (Germany) and Arizona State University (USA) support the development of ESD-specific professional action competence for teachers. Applying a mixed-method approach, the specific focus is on the links between supporting or hindering factors that affect pre-service teachers' actual achievement of intended learning outcomes. The findings indicate that both courses increased students' competence-yet, to varying degrees. The 4Cs (personal, professional, social, and structural connections) were revealed as the most significant factors affecting students' learning and should be considered when designing course offerings in Teacher Education for Sustainable Development (TESD) with the goal to develop students' knowledge, skills, and attitudes.

Their training in key competences, such as reading comprehension, would provide them with fundamental learning, empowerment, and better employment opportunities. This empirical study examines the relationship between the use of metacognitive skills while reading and improved reading comprehension previously shown in other studies - evaluating both constructs and attempting to establish whether there is a relationship between them in a sample of 143 adult secondary education students. Research outcomes in reading competence were lower than expected, with significant differences between stages and average use of metacognitive strategies, influenced by gender and age. A significant, linear, and low to moderate degree relationship was found between two of the metacognitive strategies evaluated and so a predictive model was constructed in which age, level, and use of strategies for problem-solving and reading-support are predictive variables explaining 23.4% of the variance in reading skills.

In this study, researchers attempted to compare the effectiveness of web-based collaborative problem-solving systems (wCPSS) and classroom-based collaborative hands-on learning activities (cCHLA) in the development of collaborative problem-solving skills in junior high school students who were learning science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-related subjects. A quasi-experimental, nonequivalent pretest-posttest control group design was employed, and 241 junior high school students were invited to participate in the study. According to the results, a wCPSS-supported environment with teacher guidance was found to be more effective than either a wCPSS-supported environment without teacher guidance or a cCHLA-facilitated environment in developing students' collaborative problem-solving skills in STEM fields. The study suggested that a web-based collaborative problem-solving system with teacher guidance can be used in developing junior high students' collaborative problem-solving skills in STEM education.

Programming has been the main tool for CT development; nevertheless, several issues associated with learning and teaching programming exist and have been widely described. In this study, we designed and tested in a qualitative way a set of active pedagogical strategies to implement an alternative way to immerse university students in the learning process of CT development. Such strategies were designed and analyzed under the socio-cultural vision of learning, in which individuals interact in communities to build significant knowledge. Results showed that our curriculum design engaged students in the active use of five key skills related to CT, which could be used as the base ground for further programming learning and high-level CT skills development. Additionally, data indicates that students were involved in reflective processes of learning, as well as in the development of key competencies such as teamwork, communication skills and creativity. Theoretical characteristics of the socio-cultural vision of education are subsequentially used to explain and discussed the scope and limitations of the implementation described herein.

J	York, CS; Ertmer, PA				York, Cindy S.; Ertmer, Peggy A.			Towards an understanding of instructional design heuristics: an exploratory Delphi study	ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Instructional design; Heuristics; IBSTPI competencies for instructional designers; Delphi	MODEL	Evidence suggests that experienced instructional designers often use heuristics and adapted models when engaged in the instructional design problem-solving process. This study used the Delphi technique to identify a core set of heuristics designers reported as being important to the success of the design process. The overarching purpose of the study was: (1) to examine and describe the heuristics that guided instructional designers' practice and (2) to identify the relationship between these heuristics and key competencies of the discipline, as outlined by the International Board of Standards for Training, Performance, and Instruction. Sixty-one heuristics were ultimately identified (reached consensus). All 61 aligned with at least one of the four categories of IBSTPI, with some aligning with more than one. More specifically, 17 heuristics aligned with Professional Foundations competencies, 17 aligned with Planning and Analysis competencies, 18 aligned with Design and Development competencies and 10 aligned with Implementation and Management competencies. By examining instructional design heuristics, we hope to better understand the potential genesis and/or future application of each heuristic. Results provide insights into the specific heuristics experienced designers perceive as being effective during the ID process.

J	Kutrzeba, F				Kutrzeba, Franciszek			Smart skills and education in a future economy	E-MENTOR			English	Article						smart skills; higher education; critical thinking; smart competencies; future economy	EMPLOYMENT	Regardless of whether the adopted role of education is to prepare people for pursuing employment or building general values, it will include the identification and development of skills and competences as well as professional and personal attributes. Critical thinking, ingenuity and complex cognitive-social skills are precisely those areas in which people continue to outdo intelligent machines. The purpose of this article is to review the skills and competences that will be desirable in the future in relation to recent technological changes. They are preceded by selected macroeconomic data to illustrate the situation of higher education with an emphasis on Poland, where, despite positive returns on investment in education (the highest among OECD countries), since 2005 a systematic fall in demand for higher education has been observed. The empirical part presents the results of a pilot study aimed at determining the desired future skills and professional attributes of Polish employers. The basic data was collected manually using a quantitative study during three sessions at two different job fairs in Gdansk in March 2017. According to the surveyed respondents (n = 55), professional experience, proficiency in the use of new media and formal education were indicated as the least important features, while learning and diligence - as the key competences for the future economy. In addition, the studies have shown the differences in the perception of these abilities and competences depending on the employer's position on the market, the number of employees and the internal policies of the companies.

J	Barbosa, MW; Rodrigues, CD				Werneck Barbosa, Marcelo; Rodrigues, Cesar de Avila			Project Portfolio Management teaching: Contributions of a gamified approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION			English	Article						Project portfolio management; Gamification; MBA programs	GAMIFICATION; EDUCATION; ENGAGEMENT; DESIGN; STUDENTS; TRENDS	Project Portfolio Management (PPM) is becoming a key competence for companies handling numerous projects simultaneously. PPM instructors have been largely unable to transform what is being taught into applicable skills. Gamification has been successfully applied in some educational environments and it has been increasingly applied in Management university courses. The objective of this study is to propose and assess a gamified strategy for teaching Project Portfolio Management to MBA students. The implementation of this gamified experience was carried out in 2018, 2019 and 2020 with 122 students. They were quite satisfied with the gamified experience and recognized that the Portfolio Game Experience contributed to learning different PPM techniques and processes, especially those associated with project prioritization and selection. Moreover, 100% of the respondents would recommend the course to a colleague. By qualitatively analyzing students' feedback, this study has found out that the Portfolio Game Experience provided the students the practical experience of actively learning what they have seen in theory. Students also highlighted typical game characteristics that contribute to their learning, like the fact that the game is fun, challenging, motivating and interactive. When compared to other courses they have taken so far, students evaluate this experience as superior.

The research is devoted to the study of the capabilities of online communication services for managing teamwork aimed at the development and implementation of innovative investment projects in the STEM education environment. An innovative concept of a distance learning course - Designing investment projects in the field of health care and recreation - is suggested based on organizational principles. The online communication services such as Mirapolis Virtual Room, Moodle and Microsoft Teams implemented into the educational interaction program made it possible to create a high-quality real-time e-learning environment. The online course was tested by 200 students. The results of the experiment confirmed the effectiveness of the use of online communication services and platforms in the development of professional practical experience within the educational concept of STEM. Students appreciated the high level of the innovative component in team interaction programs (98%), as well as, in the approaches to cooperation with business entities (95%); 91% of students noted the high level of quality of the educational content, pedagogical (84%), technological (92%) and conceptual (78%) innovative value of the educational product Taking a course that is based on the STEM model had a dramatic impact on the development of the key competencies of the 21st century. The study can be of interest to teachers who are looking for effective pedagogical models that can be easily adapted to the needs of the business environment and the generation of students of the new digital era.

J	Di Giulio, A; Defila, R				Di Giulio, Antonietta; Defila, Rico			Enabling university educators to equip students with inter- and transdisciplinary competencies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Transdisciplinarity; Interdisciplinarity; Interdisciplinary competencies; Interdisciplinary teaching; Teaching interdisciplinarity; Teaching transdisciplinarity	KEY COMPETENCES; SUSTAINABILITY; SCIENCE	Purpose - Inter- and transdisciplinarity are core concepts in almost all education for sustainable development (ESD) competence frameworks and curricula. To equip students with inter-and transdisciplinary competencies is highly demanding for educators. Educators must not only know how to teach students such competencies, but need to be experienced in inter-and transdisciplinary research and must have some technical knowledge about inter-and transdisciplinarity. This paper aims to show how university educators can be supported in their teaching. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is a case study based on research and on experiences in interdisciplinary teaching and in supporting educators in their interdisciplinary teaching. Findings - The paper presents a competence framework of interdisciplinary competencies to guide university teachers that has been developed, implemented and refined in interdisciplinary study programmes belonging to the field of ESD. It shows how the professional development of educators could be addressed referring to the experiences in these programmes. The measures presented consist for one thing of interdisciplinary processes among the educators and of measures directly supporting educators in their teaching for another thing. Originality/value - The case study the paper refers to is of special value, first, because the experiences are based on long-standing research and on two decades of experiences. Second, because considerable efforts were made to deliver coherent and consistent interdisciplinary teaching in which interdisciplinarity was not only a teaching subject for the students but showed by the educators as well so that the educators involved did not only talk about competencies for inter-and transdisciplinary collaborations but also set an example in their own doings.

J	Albert, M; Uhlig, M				Albert, Martin; Uhlig, Maria			Education for sustainable development at Chemnitz University of Technology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						Education for sustainable development; Higher education institution; Curriculum; Sustainable development goals; Sustainability dimensions; Chemnitz University of Technology	STAND-ALONE COURSES; MANAGEMENT EDUCATION; KEY COMPETENCES; CURRICULUM; ETHICS; CSR; PROGRAM	Purpose This paper aims to examine the current state of education for sustainable development (ESD) at Chemnitz University of Technology (CUT) and to propose a guide for analysing sustainability at higher education institutions (HEI) in terms of implementation of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and sustainability dimensions in the cognitive domain of education. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses a new combination of two frameworks, the "Phase Model of Sustainability in MBA (Master of Business Administration) Education", developed by Hart et al. (2017), to classify sustainability-focused topics and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO's) learning objectives for ESD (UNESCO, 2017) to classify sustainability-related topics. This paper analysed CUT's study programs and faculties, the websites of the study programs and the (junior) professorships, using documentary analysis with a new set of keywords relating to the topic of incorporating sustainability in curricula. Findings The faculties and study programs of CUT are at different stages of integrating ESD. However, topics such as sustainable energy and production, recycling, sustainable management and innovation are prominent in the educational offerings of CUT. As the university is a technical university, the focus on these topics reflects the general direction of the organisation. Based on this study results, this study gives recommendations for further development for ESD at CUT. Originality/value This paper presents the case of CUT and a new guide for analysing sustainability at HEI, including recommendations for further development in relation to ESD.

Accepting that something needs to be measurable to be systematically improved, the authors explored how measures relate to potential targets. This paper aims to focus on dispositions to think critically (active open-minded thinking and fair-minded thinking in appraising reasoning) as measures and explored how they related to sustainability concern as an indicative educational target. Design/methodology/approach This research included the development and testing of research instruments (scales) that explored dispositions to critical thinking and sustainability concern. Authors researched these instruments within their own correspondence groups and tested them with university students and staff in Pakistan, the USA, Austria, India and New Zealand. The authors also asked a range of contextualising questions. Findings Respondents' disposition to aspects of active, open-minded thinking and fair-minded thinking do predict their concern about facets of sustainability but their strength of religious belief was an important factor in these relationships and in their measurement. Practical implications This research demonstrates the complexity of monitoring dispositions to think critically and sustainability concern in educational systems, particularly in circumstances where the roles of religious beliefs are of interest; and suggests ways to address this complexity.

J	Tiana, SA; Villarreal, AA				Albareda Tiana, Silvia; Alferez Villarreal, Azul			A collaborative programme in sustainability and social responsibility	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Competences; Sustainability; Higher education; Social responsibility; Collaborative programme	HIGHER-EDUCATION; KEY COMPETENCES; FRAMEWORK	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to collect methodological strategies used in the training of future teachers to develop competences in sustainability and social responsibility (SSR). The proposal in this paper is to show how students learn and develop competences by performing practical activities and through a collaborative experience, conducted in a real-life context in the university campus. Design/methodology/approach - This paper collects together a selection of competences and sub-competences in SSR, together with the methodological scenarios that allowed their implementation. The results in the acquisition of competences, as well as the efficiency of the methodological strategies employed, were obtained from the qualitative analysis of student questionnaires and of their final academic results. Findings - Changing the teaching methods to include collaborative methodological strategies facilitates the acquisition of SSR competences. Research limitations/implications - A methodological limitation of this study is the fact that it has taken place in one academic year. The authors realize that to provide evidence of a profound behavioural change (which goes beyond the improvement of a habit), there is a need to carry out a longer study, which is complex when working with final year students. The authors are suggesting that the University carry out prolonged studies on the implementation and assessment of competences in SSR in the University and afterwards in the work place. Practical implications - At the start of the course year, a problem was identified, namely, that future teachers lacked sustainable habit patterns. This was turned into a learning opportunity that led to a collaborative SSR programme on the campus. Social implications - Creating varied practical methodological scenarios has contributed to the development of SSR competences by the pupils. Students have questioned their lifestyles and have modified their consumption habits. Additionally, doing a transdisciplinary collaborative programme in our own campus has played a part in changing our organization for the better and has facilitated combining research and teaching. Originality/value - This paper helps clarify how SSR competences can be developed in a local, real-life context.

To accompany young learners in the development of competence, and to guarantee optimal implementation of information and communication technologies (ICTs), it is necessary that teachers are, in turn, literate. We had 43 secondary school teachers in initial training to assess their own level of competence in 21 sub-competences in five areas identified by the DIGCOMP project, using the rubrics provided in the Common Digital Competence Framework for Teachers (Spanish Ministry of Education). Overall, pre-service teachers' conceptions about their level of digital competence was low (Initial). Students scored highest in information, which refers mostly to the operations they performed while being students. Secondly, in safety and communication, excluding protection of digital data and preservation of digital identity. Lowest values were achieved in content creation and problem solving, the dimensions most closely related with the inclusion of ICTs to transform teaching-learning processes. The knowledge or skills they exhibit are largely self-taught and, so, we perceive an urgent need to purposefully incorporate relational and didactic aspects of ICT integration.

For this reason, its acquisition and development should be on the agenda of higher education institutions (HEIs) who wish to prepare their students to thrive in an ever faster evolving digital labour market. However, the existence of a valid instrument that can help HEIs measuring and further integrating digital competence into pedagogical and organisational practices with sufficient precision is yet to be accomplished. This article provides a valid and reliable instrument to measure higher education students' digital competence on the basis of the European Digital Competence Framework for Citizens, also known as DigComp. The instrument was applied to a sample of 411 students from a mid-large public HEI and the results attest its validity and reliability. In addition, the study explores proficiency differences among students from different fields of education and training, and gender. Results demystify the idea that ICT students are more digitally competent than those in other fields of study, but suggest males score higher than females, which feeds into the ongoing debate of gender differences in relation to digital technologies and the readiness of females for the digital labour market. The results lead to clear implications for research and practice.

Assessing sustainability education in a transdisciplinary undergraduate course focused on real-world problem solving: a case for disciplinary grounding	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Assessment; Interdisciplinarity; Sustainability competencies; Sustainability education; Transdisciplinary	FRAMEWORK; THINKING; ETHICS; MODEL	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a classroom assessment aimed at determining the extent to which key sustainability competencies develop in students during an introductory transdisciplinary sustainability course. Design/methodology/approach - The paper summarizes three previously identified key sustainability competencies and describes teaching methodologies used in the introductory course described here to foster these competencies in students. The development of these competencies over the course of one semester is assessed using a pre-/post-test based on case analyses. The implications of these findings for academic sustainability programs are discussed. Findings - Based on the assessment used here, the sustainability competencies developed differently in students with different disciplinary affiliations as a result of the introductory sustainability course. Business majors did not improve any of the key competencies, sustainability majors improved systems thinking competence only, and sustainability minors who were majoring in another traditional discipline improved all competencies. Originality/value - The paper contributes to undergraduate sustainability education by shedding light on how sustainability might best be incorporated into specific academic programs. This information may help create more effective sustainability courses and academic programs, which may maintain the viability of current sustainability programs and promote the institutionalization of sustainability in higher education in general.

J	McCarthy, B; Eagle, L				McCarthy, Breda; Eagle, Lynne			Are the sustainability-oriented skills and competencies of business graduates meeting or missing employers' needs? Perspectives of regional employers	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION			English	Article						sustainability education; skills and competencies; regional employers	HIGHER-EDUCATION; KEY COMPETENCES; UNIVERSITY; EMPLOYABILITY; FRAMEWORK; BARRIERS; STUDENTS; IMPACT; PROGRAMS; ADOPTION	In the Anthropocene, universities play a role in developing students' sustainability literacy and capacity to solve socio-ecological challenges. The objective of this study is to identify the generic and sustainability-oriented skills and competencies required of business graduates by regional employers. The regional focus meets a gap in the literature. An online survey of employers in North Queensland found that they attach importance to a wide range of skills and competencies and see sustainability as a key factor in future business success. Yet, there are contradictions in terms of their support for sustainability in the curriculum and business practices, particularly when it comes to the recruitment and selection process. Furthermore, contradictions exist between the university's adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the weak interest displayed by prospective employers in graduates' sustainability literacy. This study has important implications for regional universities. A reframing of the role of sustainability education in the curriculum is warranted, where a deeper connection is made between sustainability education and the values employers already hold. Recommendations for curriculum designers are made on how to foster and assess the competencies that business graduates need to meet the demands of regional business upon entering the labour market.

J	Di Maio, G; Graf, L; Wilson, A				Di Maio, Gina; Graf, Lukas; Wilson, Anna			Embedded flexibilization and polite employer domination: the case of short-track apprenticeships in Switzerland	EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING			English	Article						Skill formation systems; VET; Liberalization; Institutional change; Short-tracks; Two-year apprenticeships; Process tracing	INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE; WELFARE-STATE; STRATEGIES; CAPITALISM; GOVERNANCE; VARIETIES; SYSTEMS	Liberalization pressures challenge countries to adapt their training systems. This is particularly relevant for coordinated market economies with firm-driven but collectively governed apprenticeship systems. Recent literature has identified different liberalization trajectories for these countries. For instance, segmentalism describes the increasing influence of large employers in Germany. In Denmark, state agencies manage increased flexibility in training through embedded flexibilization. In this paper, we identify a new form of embedded flexibilization, characterized by polite employer domination. We find this trajectory of liberalization in Switzerland, which represents another training system heavily based on firm involvement. We illustrate our argument with the example of short-track apprenticeship training, which has been expanded in all three mentioned countries in response to ongoing liberalization and deindustrialization pressures. In Switzerland, the relevant reform was initiated by the state while business adopted a rather passive role initially. Yet, state actors eventually stepped back and delegated key competences to employers, which implies that the employers' camp asserted their interests in the end while tolerating some concessions for the benefit of disadvantaged groups. Our process tracing reveals that policy makers used layering to implement short-tracks that enhance social inclusion, while simultaneously increasing the scope of employer cooperation.

J	Guichon, N				Guichon, Nicolas			Training future language teachers to develop online tutors' competence through reflective analysis	RECALL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Eurocall 2008 Conference	FEB, 2008	Kodolanyi Janos Univ Coll, Szekesfehervar, HUNGARY		Kodolanyi Janos Univ Coll	Teacher education; desktop videoconferencing; critical analysis; competencies; self-confrontation; synchronous computer-mediated communication	EDUCATION	This article sets out to identify key competencies which language tutors need to develop in order to manage synchronous online teaching. In order to aptly monitor interactions with distant learners, it is proposed that three types of regulation pertaining to socio-affective, pedagogical and multimedia aspects are required. On the one hand, this research aims at specifying these competencies and, on the other hand, it seeks to identify the relevance of reflective analysis for professional development. The context of this study is a teacher training programme for Masters Degree students in teaching French as a foreign language that provides trainees with the opportunity of teaching online to intermediate-level students of French from a North American university via a desktop videoconferencing platform. This programme first endeavours to put trainees in a professional situation by getting them to prepare and administer sessions in order to confront them with the specific challenges of synchronous online tutoring. Second, it seeks to help them to gain insight into their own activity by developing critical thinking towards their own practice. The data elicited for this research derive from the tutor trainees' interpretations of their own practice when confronted with the film of their own situated activity. The episodes chosen by the trainees to feed the self-confrontation process constitute significant units because by being told and commented upon, they elucidate how and to what extent competencies are built. Three discursive strategies have been identified and used to organise the content analysis of the data: description; expression of a difficulty; reflective review of the activity. The strategies used by trainees to verbalise their own activity can inform teacher educators about the constraints of the work situation and about the resources trainees need to deploy to face Lip to this unknown professional situation. Results indicate that trainees concentrate particularly on pedagogical aspects that distance and faulty technology have rendered complex. The encountered difficulties are equally distributed between a repertoire of competencies pertaining to language teaching and competencies more directly linked with online teaching. Finally, this study has enabled us to assess the potential of self-confrontation for teacher practice and leads us to propose directions for improving this training device.

Development of Core Competencies of Construction Managers: The Effect of Training and Education	TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING			English	Article						Construction manager; Core competencies; Delphi study; Knowledge; Skills; Attitudes; Training methods; Training approaches	SKILLS; ATTITUDES; INDUSTRY; DELPHI	Construction managers are the drivers of project success. To perform well, they need to possess key competencies, such as knowledge, skills, and attitudes, all of which can be improved through proper training. However, despite the skill shortage that still exists in the construction industry, extant literature does not precisely reveal the training methods and training approaches that can impart to construction managers the knowledge, skills, and attitudes they require. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify training methods and training approaches that can develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that construction managers require. The paper presents the results of a Delphi study with 12 experts and 44 professionals, who were asked to provide their opinions on training methods and training approaches that can be adopted to develop the core competencies expected of construction managers. The study revealed 20 elements of knowledge, skills, and attitudes that are most significant to construction managers in the form of competencies and the training methods and training approaches that can deliver those competencies. The most significant knowledge was found to be schedule management and planning, the most significant skill time management and the most significant attitude supportive leadership. Furthermore, learning by doing and private training provided within the workplace were identified as the most favourable training methods and training approaches, respectively for construction managers to acquire the significant competencies they require.

The aim of the research was to determine what competencies of art teachers are needed for school work and professional and proactive role in the society and what the possibilities of their professional development are. The research sample included 220 art teachers working in primary and secondary school. Results indicate that initial teacher education to large extent determines their teaching preferences, as well as that many respondents recognise art teachers' competencies as essential for their work at school and social community. It is noted that a small number of art teachers participate in school projects, experimental programmes, teachers' associations, and that they are largely involved only in the work of school teams. It can be concluded that their professional development needs to be focused towards the development of sensitivity for the identification and understanding of different professional and social patterns and roles, towards social interaction and involvement in various school teams and teachers' associations, through which they can provide themselves with a source of support and resources for their work.

J	Pedrosa-de-Jesus, H; Moreira, A; Lopes, B; Watts, M				Pedrosa-de-Jesus, Helena; Moreira, Aurora; Lopes, Betina; Watts, Mike			So much more than just a list: exploring the nature of critical questioning in undergraduate sciences	RESEARCH IN SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						critical questioning; critical thinking; higher education; science undergraduates; competency	CRITICAL THINKING; DISPOSITION; STUDENTS; SCHOOL; ASKING	Background: Critical thinking is one of the very highest orders of cognitive abilities and a key competency in higher education. Asking questions is an important component of rich learning experiences, structurally embedded in the operations of critical thinking. Our clear sense is that critical thinking and, within that, critical questioning, is heavily context dependent, in the sense that is applied, used by critical learners in a contextualised way. Purpose: Our research deals with enhancing science undergraduates' critical questioning. We are interested in understanding and describing the nature and development of students' critical questioning. The purpose is to conceptualise critical questioning as a competency, into three domains - knowledge, skills and attitudes/dispositions. We have no interest in a taxonomic category of context-free question-types called 'critical questions'. In contrast, our view is that 'being a critical questioner' trades heavily on context. Sources of evidence: Four cases are considered as illuminative of the dimensions of science undergraduates' critical questioning. Data were collected in natural learning environments through non-participant observation, audio-taping teacher-students interactions and semi-structured interviews. Students' written material resulting from diverse learning tasks was also collected. Main argument: Our supposition is that one vehicle for achieving university students as critical thinkers is to enable them not just to ask critical questions, but to be critical questioners. We relate critical questioning to three domains: (1) context, (2) competency and (3) delivery, and propose a model based on illuminating examples of the in-classroom action. Conclusions: The dimensions of the competency-context-delivery model provide a framework for describing successful student critical questioning, showing that students' capacity to be critical can be developed. It is possible, in our view, to generate critical questioners by means of promoting a true spirit of critical inquiry. The model also gives important insights into the design of teaching, learning and assessment contexts, where critical questioning could be promoted.

J	Qian, J; Ying, W; Li, FT				Qian Jia; Ying Wang; Li Fengting			Establishing transdisciplinary minor programme as a way to embed sustainable development into higher education system Case by Tongji University, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Education for sustainable development; Higher education; Transdisciplinary; Higher education for sustainable development in China; Minor education	KEY COMPETENCES; CURRICULUM; FRAMEWORK	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide a case study of the establishment and development of a minor program in Sustainable Development in Tongji University, China, and how it contributes to embedding sustainable development into higher education system as an alternative platform for researchers and students to involve in a transdisciplinary teaching and learning process. Design/methodology/approach This case reviews the institutional setting and the different studying models and requirements for postgraduates and undergraduates. Postgraduate students have to take four core courses, select one module with four themed courses (4 + 4 fixed) and complete a transdisciplinary essay, and undergraduates can choose any three courses in all modules apart from the four core courses (4 + 3 open), with a transdisciplinary group project. Findings The development of the minor program reveals the popularity and decline of different modules, because of the popularity of the schools and institutes behind them, the university legacy and the media influence. The program design spurs transdisciplinary thinking on sustainable development but brings about challenges including time conflict with students' major study. In conclusion, this program explores alternative education practices in embedding sustainable development in education system, contributing to and reflect on Education for Sustainable Development and the education reform in China. Originality/value The case presents a unique way of implementing Education for Sustainable Development in higher education system, in which minor education stands between formal and informal curriculum to tackle the barriers in undertaking sustainable development initiatives in curricula, through nurturing the culture and providing organizational support.

J	Singer-Brodowski, M; Grossmann, K; Bartke, S; Huning, S; Weinsziehr, T; Hagemann, N				Singer-Brodowski, Mandy; Grossmann, Katrin; Bartke, Stephan; Huning, Sandra; Weinsziehr, Theresa; Hagemann, Nina			Competency-oriented education for sustainable development: Lessons from five courses on energy poverty	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Higher education for sustainable development; Competency development; Energy poverty; Problem- and project-based learning; Wicked-sustainability problems	FUEL POVERTY; DEFINITIONS; CLIMATE; POLICY	Purpose Energy poverty can be seen as a relatively new, but typical sustainability problem in which various dimensions (ecology, society and economy) are interlinked and in part conflict with each other. Moreover, the variety of involved stakeholders (planners, tenants, housing companies, private landlords, energy consultants, etc.) represents conflicting aims for solving this problem. This paper aims to present a systematic linkage between higher education for sustainable development (HESD) and education about energy poverty yet. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative comparative case study approach with a similar didactic approach is used. Findings Based on the literature about HESD and an overall model in general didactics, ten criteria were identified and used for an overall reflection about similar courses dealing with the topic of energy poverty. The criteria covered the learning goals, the didactical approaches and the institutional support in the forms of organisation in the courses. Research limitations/implications There was no competency measurement of the students in the described courses. Practical implications There was no evaluation of the development of students' key competencies for sustainability. However, the reflections of students and teachers revealed a positive development regarding the students' learning process, especially because they worked on a real-world sustainability problem: energy poverty. Originality/value This contribution describes how university courses on energy poverty were designed and implemented at five German universities. Against the background of general criteria for HESD, it reflects on the experiences that the use of this concept evoked. Through a comparison of the five courses against these criteria, the paper outlines strengths and weaknesses of the approach and closes with recommendations and requirements for designing further courses.

J	Frank, P				Frank, Pascal			A proposal of personal competencies for sustainable consumption	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Sustainable consumption; Education for sustainable consumption; Competency-based education; Personal competencies	POST-TRUTH; HIGHER-EDUCATION; KEY COMPETENCES; BEHAVIOR; CLIMATE; FRAMEWORK; VALUES; POLARIZATION; EFFICACY; IMPACT	Purpose Despite advances in Environmental and Sustainability Education (ESE) scholarship and practice, ESE has not yet contributed to mitigate the sustainability-related problems it is meant to remedy. As part of an explanation, some scholars have argued that current ESE scholarship and practice overemphasizes intellectual and neglects (intra-)personal competencies as envisaged learning outcomes of ESE learning programs and activities. To date, however, such personal competencies have not been systematically specified in terms of the challenges they are meant to respond to. This paper aims to derive personal competencies from an analysis of inner challenges individuals face when engaging with the cause of sustainable consumption. Design/methodology/approach The study is conceptual and proceeds in two steps: In the first step, it analyzes existing research on challenges individuals experience when intending to change their consumer behavior and engaging in consumption-related learning activities. In a second step, a set of personal competencies for sustainable consumption are derived from the analysis of challenges. Based on the set of competencies, suggestions for future research empirically corroborating the reflections of this paper are made. Findings The discussion of challenges indicates that both sustainable consumption and consumption-related learning activities can come along with a series of affective-motivational challenges. In contrast to established competency frameworks, personal competencies emphasize the importance of affective-motivational learning outcomes instead of intellectual ones. They are defined here as abilities, proficiencies or skills related to inner states and processes that can be considered necessary to engage with the cause of sustainability. Personal competencies responding to the inner challenges of engaging with sustainable consumption include ethics, self-awareness, emotional resilience, self-care, access to and cultivation of ethical qualities and mindsets for sustainability. Research limitations/implications Given that this paper is conceptual, further research is needed to empirically inquire into the importance of personal competencies for sustainable consumption and corroborate the provided reflections. Furthermore, the study has not responded to some of the concerns a few ESE experts have expressed concerning the concept of (intra-)personal competencies more generally. To address these concerns, future research should be dedicated to empirically validating and operationalizing personal competencies, eventually leading to tools allowing for a systematic assessment of these competencies. Based on such assessment tools, pedagogical formats should be elaborated and evaluated with regard to their potential to stimulate personal sustainability competencies. Originality/value The concept of personal competencies explicitly acknowledges that current unsustainability is associated with the experience of inner, affective-motivational challenges. ESE learning programs and activities should prepare learners for these challenges. However, a specification of these inner challenges and corresponding personal competencies has not yet been undertaken. The set of personal competencies outlined in this paper can serve as a first starting point for specifying personal sustainability competencies and makes a case why their consideration is important when it comes to designing and evaluating ESE learning programs and activities.

Individual tasks of project assignment titled "Temperature Measurement" were conceived for "guided inquiry". We also supported the IBL of pupils by interactive education strategy-Integrated e-Learning (INTe-L). The strategy was built on the role of interactive simulations and experimenting at the knowledge acquisition. The following INTe-L components were used: (a) on-site and remote experiments, (b) interactive simulations and (c) electronic study materials. The research was based the hypothesis that the project-based teaching of the topic "Temperature Measurement" using the IBL activities is significantly more efficient than traditional (instructivist) way of teaching. To verify the hypothesis, we carried out a pedagogical experiment on a sample of 60 respondents. The third graders were divided into two parallel groups: an experimental group (EG, 30 pupils) and control group (CG, 30 pupils). To get a relevant feedback, pre-test and post-test were developed and applied. The results attained in the EG were statistically processed, evaluated, and subsequently compared with those in the CG. The analysis of the results attained by the EG showed that their knowledge acquisition has been increased by 24% compared to CG. We have created a methodology for making simple scientific project assignments with the implementation of all components of the new integrated e-learning education strategy (real and real remote experiment, e-simulation, e-learning material). On a specific example of the topic "Temperature Measurement" in primary education, we have presented the possibility of using a "guided inquiry" in the implementation of individual experimental tasks. We have introduced a form of teamwork that allows to harmonize the teaching requirements with individual learning approach and helps to prepare pupils for planned work and independent knowledge acquisition and problem solving. The study has shown that complex IBL activities can be successfully applied at primary school 3rd grade level already. Our form of education with the wider use of modern information and communication technologies (ICT) was attractive for the learners and helped them to develop interdisciplinary relationships. The integrated e-learning has helped third grades to develop a deeper conceptual understanding of temperature and allowed them to prepare presentations to demonstrate their conceptual knowledge. The approach allowed pupils to gain key competencies in Science (discussion and presentation of results). It has also increased the pupils' interest in Science in general and helped them to understand links between different subjects.

Feasibility and acceptability of virtually coaching residents on communication skills: a pilot study	BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Telehealth; Virtual coaching; Communication skills; Resident education; Resident curriculum	SELF-ASSESSMENT; WEIGHT-LOSS; TELEMEDICINE; EDUCATION; COVID-19; BARRIERS	Background Developing communication skills is a key competency for residents. Coaching, broadly accepted as a training modality in medical education, has been proven a successful tool for teaching communication skills. Little research is available thus far to investigate virtual coaching on communication skills for telemedicine encounters. The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that virtually coaching residents on communication skills is feasible and acceptable. We surveyed 21 resident-faculty pairs participating in a "fully virtual" coaching session (patient, coach, and resident were virtual). Methods We asked 50 neurology resident-faculty coach pairs to complete one "fully virtual" coaching session between May 20 and August 31, 2020. After each session, the resident and coach completed a 15-item survey, including Likert-style scale and open-ended questions, assessing feasibility and acceptability. Descriptive statistics and qualitative content and thematic analyses were performed. Results Forty-two percent (21/50) of all eligible residents completed "fully virtual" coaching sessions. The overall survey response rate was 91 % (38/42). The majority of respondents agreed that the direct observation and debriefing conversation were easy to schedule and occurred without technical difficulties and that debriefing elements (self-reflection, feedback, takeaways) were useful for residents. Ninety-five percent of respondents rated the coach's virtual presence to be not at all disruptive to the resident-patient interaction. Virtual coaching alleviated resident stress associated with observation and was perceived as an opportunity for immediate feedback and a unique approach for resident education that will persist into the future. Conclusions In this pilot study, residents and faculty coaches found virtual coaching on communication skills feasible and acceptable for telemedicine encounters. Many elements of our intervention may be adoptable by other residency programs. For example, residents may share their communication goals with clinic faculty supervisors and then invite them to directly observe virtual encounters what could facilitate targeted feedback related to the resident's goals. Moreover, virtual coaching on communication skills in both the in-person and telemedicine settings may particularly benefit residents in challenging encounters such as those with cognitively impaired patients or with surrogate decision-makers.

R.; Gomes, Elisabete Xavier; Alves, Mariana Gaio; Azevedo, Nair Rios			Theory and Texts of Educational Policy: Possibilities and Constraints	STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Lifelong learning; Educational theory; European Union; Policy texts	COMPLEXITY	In our paper we aim at reflecting upon the extent to which educational theory may be used as a framework in the analysis of policy documents. As policy texts are 'heteroglossic in character' (Lingard and Ozga, in The Routledge Falmer reader in education policy and politics, Routledge, London and New York, 2007, p. 2) and create "circumstances in which the range of options available in deciding what to do are narrowed or changed" (Ball in, Education policy and social class: The selected works of Stephen J Ball, Routledge, London and New York, 2006, p. 46), they need to be theoretically tackled in their underlying assumptions and implications. This proposal draws on an analysis of two sets of documents of the European Union: texts produced between 2000 and 2006, underlying the European Union programmes; and texts produced by a working group focusing on the key competences of Lifelong Learning (2003-2006). Initially, the framework for the analysis of different documents was grounded on the existing research in the field of educational policy. Now we attempt a secondary analysis of the collected data by transposing the borders of this particular and highly prolific field. We argue that what is outside the texts may reshape what is inside the texts. Educational theory allows us to define some conceptual tools in order to question the documents as political apparatus which open and constrain possibilities. Therefore, we will use educational theory as an arena where different matters, perspectives and possibilities may be explored and assembled. We have engaged in a conversation with both the data and some theoretical approaches. Central to this conversation are the concepts of "ignorant schoolmaster" (Ranciere, in The ignorant schoolmaster five lessons in intellectual emancipation, Stanford University Press, Stanford, 1991), "learning contexts" (Edwards, in Rethinking contexts for learning and teaching, Routledge, Oxon and New York, 2009a, b), and "experience" (Larrosa, in Revista Brasileira de Educacao, 19:20-28, 2002).

The methodology enables us to quantify this perception, which, in turn, allows us to determine: to what extent the objectives related to ESD are achieved in the degree, and to compare the learning in ESD perceived by students of different degrees. The methodology is applied to nine engineering degrees and nine education degrees in the Spanish university system. Design/methodology/approach ESD is analysed from the students' learning perception. This perception is measured by comparing the responses of first- and fourth-year students to a questionnaire about their sustainability competencies. Two indicators have been designed to analyse the results. The first indicator, learning increase, measures the declared learning difference between fourth- and first-year students. The second indicator, learning percentage, measure the amount of learning as reported by fourth-year students compared to how much they could have learned. Findings The results show that the average learning percentage perceived by students is higher in engineering degrees (33%) than in education degrees (27%), despite the fact that the average learning increase declared by students at the end of their studies in both areas of knowledge is similar (66%). Engineering students report having achieved higher learning than education students in all sustainability competencies, with the exception of ethics. Originality/value This paper analyses ESD from the student's perspective. Furthermore, to the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study that compares the perception of ESD between engineering and education students. This comparison allows us to determine the different approaches that university Professors take to ESD according to the discipline they teach.

It is found that the methodology of lapbooking allows you to unlock the potential of each student in the process of creating individual or more often collective work. In particular, the lapbook forms key skills and abilities, which are required by the educational vector of the New Ukrainian School. In addition, it takes into account cross-curricular learning and social competencies, which help each individual to become successful and adapt in society. The article proves that the use of Lapbooks is reasonable not only when studying a single topic, but also as a complex, systemic type of work, as close to the project and research activities as possible. It was found out that the introduction of lapbooking at different stages of studying subjects is effective, as it covers different types of activity: pair and group work; search methods and work with information (ability to work with sources, generalize and systematize, draw conclusions, formulate own statements concisely and informatively). It is noted that the technique of lapbooking can be applied as early as preschool age with a gradual complication of high school. Consequently, the general essence of lapbooking is systematized with the help of integrative diagrams and charts. It is determined that the educational industry must be flexible to timely respond to changes in society and provide the professional market with specialists, successful and active citizens who are able not only to adapt, but also to realize themselves. The innovativeness of the lapbooking method is that it combines different areas of activity simultaneously: informational, research, design, communicative, creative, technological, aesthetic. The results of the study allow us to recommend lapbooking as the main method of work in elementary school (when studying any topic or academic subject).

While the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) demand organisations to change practices and adapt to sustainable goals, there is a lack of understanding in how competencies can enhance these goals. The purpose of this paper is twofold: Study 1 explores competencies related to sustainability required in a work force and examines employer perceptions on the existing literature for competencies. Study 2 empirically tests the influence of sustainability scholarship on non-technical competencies in the work force. Design/methodology/approach - A mixed method approach was undertaken. A sample of managers from 39 large Australian organisations participated in the scoping study. This was followed by further interviewing executives from 12 multinational corporations in China to assess the validity of competencies and provide deeper understanding of the issues at hand. The quantitative study analysed a sample of executive responses from 229 multinationals in China using factor and regression analysis to test for the effects of mediation. Findings - The research highlights that the underlying competencies regarding sustainability influences the bigger picture within firms for attaining sustainability. The affective and cognitive growth of sustainability scholarship is governed mainly by a firm's sustainable values. Core organisational values facilitate the development of non-technical competencies. These relationships and their cumulative effect on competencies provide a theoretical framework for acquiring sustainability within organisations. Employees need sustainability scholarship for enhancing sustainability. Sustainability scholarship reflects high-level learning obtained through universities or training. The research found that non-technical competencies such as professional ethical responsibility mediate between core business competencies and sustainability scholarship. Originality/value - By exploring employer's perception of competencies, the study first makes an important contribution in addressing the need to support SDGs by bridging organisational-level competencies and sustainability literacy, which hold significant benefits for practitioners, academia and organisations at large. Second, the theoretical findings strengthen the need for embedding competencies in the curriculum. It conveys the need for sustainability literacy/scholarship to align with organisational training and learning pedagogies, in order to effectively meet industry needs. Third, it provides useful insights on employers' estimation about workplace competencies and broadens our understanding on the contribution that competencies within organisations make to this end.

This is not only the consequence of the importance of some pathogenic microorganisms, but also due to their positive and important role in processes related to human health, food production or waste recycling, to cite a few. However, the relevance of microbiology for the well-being of humankind and the planet still needs to reach beyond academic circles. Many current matters of urgency, such as environmental pollution or climate change, could partly be tackled by using green and sustainable solutions derived from microbial biotechnologies. Nevertheless, the wider public still attributes a negative connotation to microbes such as fungi and bacteria. The aim of this study was to implement service-learning as a pedagogical approach to increase scientific and microbiology literacy in society. Service-learning is a teaching and learning strategy that integrates community service and civic responsibility, fostering the dissemination of scientific knowledge. This approach is used to communicate about pressing societal issues surrounding microbes (antibiotic resistance, natural resources recycling, human microbiota, and food production among others) to an audience of pupils attending public schools. The activity of service-learning is proposed in the final year of the biology bachelor curriculum. Its purpose is to allow university students to develop and practice their lay communication skills as a key competence to be acquired during their university education. In the activity, the students developed their own concept and material for the activity and delivered it to pupils at primary and secondary school levels (pupils aged 6-15 years old). The message is also expected to be disseminated beyond the participants, when the students and pupils share their experience with family and friends. With this pedagogical approach, we intend to raise awareness regarding about the importance of microbiology and its dual roles as harmful and beneficial for humans. We also wish to increase the connection between primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions. Finally, we want to highlight the importance of having a new generation of communication savvy professionals in biology.

The aims of the administered questionnaire were to identify students' perceptions of the development of sustainability competencies; to analyse the relationship between students' perceived level of competence and the subject area, previous teaching experience and previous participation in sustainability projects; and to explore the strengths and limitations of the assessment tool used. Design/methodology/approach - An ad hoc questionnaire of 18 items was designed to analyse students' self-conception of the development of four sustainability competencies. A set of six units of competence were identified and three levels of acquisition for each unit Knowledge (referred to conceptual learning), Knowhow (related to practical skills) and Do (linked to the demonstration in action and its transferability to real-life situations). The sample included 183 postgraduate secondary teacher students from different disciplines and subject areas. Findings - The findings of this study show that students positioned themselves for the four sustainability competencies in a medium level of competence. No statistical significant differences exist between the subject areas and the level of sustainability competence. A statistically significant difference was found between previous teaching experience and participation in sustainability projects in relation to their perceived level of sustainability competencies. Participation in sustainability projects is clearly shown as a differentiating factor in the levels of sustainability competencies. Originality/value - An empirical study has been conducted to investigate preservice teachers' perceptions on the self-development of four sustainability competencies, considering three levels of acquisition (Know, Knowhow and Do). This study provides insights into ESD teaching and learning approaches and the assessment of Education for Sustainable Development outcomes. It also points out the importance of conceptualising sustainability competencies and operationalising these competencies in assessment tools that can help measure sustainability competencies' development.

Background In a highly active learning environment that incorporates research into teaching, the effective use of various learning strategies is considered of high importance for the successful engagement of students. Yet, this line of research has mainly focused on individual learning. Shifting from individual to collaborative learning settings, the current study investigated whether students' use of self-regulated learning, peer learning, and help seeking strategies influenced their perceptions on both the group activities and the respective outcomes. Methodology At the beginning of the course, 81 first semester postgraduate students self-reported the level of use of self-regulated learning, peer learning, and help seeking strategies by filling in the respective subscales of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). Then, groups of 3 or 4 students were formed and instructed to create several learning artifacts of different types and conduct a peer-tutoring session, based on a topic assigned to them by the teacher. Additionally, the same groups conducted a research project of their own choice within course topics. Students' final grade served as an indicator of their academic performance. At the end of the semester, students filled in a questionnaire eliciting their perceptions on the process and the outputs of the course activities. Finally, through statistical analysis of students' responses to the questionnaires, the influence of learning strategies on students' perceptions and their academic performance was examined. Contribution Our findings contribute to the literature regarding the research-teaching nexus in higher education settings. More specifically, the study shows how students' self-reported use of learning strategies affects students' perceptions on the activities they were engaged in, their achievement of cognitive learning outcomes, and their skills development in a research-integrated course design. Findings Students perceived differently the value of producing and studying learning artifacts. Students who scored higher in the self-regulated learning and peer learning subscales of MSLQ perceived their role as more active in the preparation of the presentation for the peer-tutoring session, which was the artifact that required higher level of interaction among the group members. Students' final grades were influenced partially by their self-reported use of different learning strategies. Recommendations for Practitioners Integrating research into teaching through the assignment of research-related tasks to students can promote students' acquisition of domain knowledge and research skills. The merits of this approach can be further strengthened by having students working in groups and providing the outputs of their involvement in the research-related activities as learning material for their peers. Furthermore, students' individual characteristics (e.g., use of learning strategies and preferences should be taken into account when designing course activities). Recommendations for Researchers Researchers should continue to explore the way that various learning strategies influence different aspects of the learning process, especially in the achievement of cognitive learning outcomes and the development of general skills. Impact on Society Creating learning environments that foster students' active engagement with the course material and peer collaboration should be a vital goal of higher education institutes as it can improve students' performance and promote the necessary skills for self-directed and autonomous learning, a key competence in the modern workplace. Future Research In this study, both cognitive learning outcomes and general skills were assessed by students' final grade.

Background The global shift to competency-based medical education aims to improve the performance of its trainees, including in the key competency domain of clinical reasoning. However, research on whether such education actually improves clinical reasoning is sparse. The purpose of this study is to compare assessed clinical reasoning performance in digitally presented cases of acute dyspnoea between final-year medical students from a traditional, discipline-based and those from an integrated, competency-based undergraduate programme. Methods A total of 60 medical students in their final-year clerkships participated in the study; 30 were from a discipline-based programme, and 30 were from a competency-based programme of the same faculty. The students completed a knowledge test consisting of 22 single choice items and a computer-based test of clinical reasoning with six video-based case scenarios with different underlying diseases leading to dyspnoea. The operationalized measures of clinical reasoning were the number and relevance of the diagnostic tests chosen, time to diagnosis and diagnostic accuracy. Results The two groups did not differ in their knowledge of the acute dyspnoea content domain. With regard to clinical reasoning, the selection of relevant tests, time required to make a diagnosis and accuracy of the diagnosis varied across the six case scenarios in both groups. However, the results from the measures of the clinical reasoning process did not differ between the students from the two types of undergraduate medical programmes. No significant differences were found with regard to the selection of relevant diagnostic tests (M = 63.8% vs. M = 62.8%), the time to a diagnosis (M = 128.7 s vs. M = 136.4 s) or the accuracy of diagnosis (M = 82.2% vs. M = 77.0%). Conclusions Key indicators of the clinical reasoning process, when assessed with objectively measured parameters, did not differ between final-year medical students from a traditional, discipline-based and those from an integrated, competency-based undergraduate programme in the domain of acute dyspnoea. The results substantiate and expand those of previous studies based on subjective assessor ratings that showed limited change in the clinical reasoning performance of medical students with competency-based undergraduate education.

J	Nikolic, V; Vukic, T; Maletaski, T; Andevski, M				Nikolic, Vesna; Vukic, Tamara; Maletaski, Tatjana; Andevski, Milica			Students' attitudes towards sustainable development in Serbia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Sustainable development; Students; Higher education; Attitudes	HIGHER-EDUCATION; ENVIRONMENTAL ATTITUDES; KEY COMPETENCES	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine university students' attitudes towards the concept of sustainable development and towards the need for the implementation of education for sustainable development into the higher education system. To that end, the paper explores in a process-oriented focus which drivers and barriers are experienced as being the most important ones and how they relate to one another. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on the questionnaire for the evaluation of attitudes towards the concept of sustainable development. This instrument consists of 9 batteries with 83 items presented in the form of the five-point Likert scale. The questionnaire evaluated different aspects of respondents' attitudes towards the concept of sustainable development, but students' attitudes in relation to the items from the following subscales will be presented for this paper: understanding the concept of sustainable development, position of sustainable development in the system of higher education, sources of information about sustainable development and entities responsible for sustainable development. The study sample consisted of students from the University of Novi Sad, specifically from the faculties with accredited programs in the field of humanities and technological sciences. Findings In general, students recognized the main determinants of sustainable development and they support an integral approach to sustainability, i.e. the need to include the knowledge, values and skills for sustainable development in the higher education programs. In addition, they identified a number of obstacles and the uncertainties of overcoming them. In this regard, the students did not recognize the responsibility of the higher education institutions as the key responsibility or their own responsibility in relation to sustainable development, which can be related to their feeling of marginalization and the doubt that their behaviour and decisions can influence the development of the local society, as well as the development of the society as a whole. On the other hand, the respondents acknowledged the role, the importance and the responsibility of the mass media in the process of developing the attitudes towards and opinions about the problems related to environmental protection and sustainable development. Practical implications The results of the study indicate the students' attitudes towards sustainable development, thus making the directions for higher education reform clearer and in line with the present needs for sustainable development in Serbia. The obtained results can serve as a recommendation to the governing structures, i.e. to the relevant ministries of education and environmental protection, as well as to the universities in terms of which direction their process of planning and creating paths of sustainability should take. This is particularly important in the case of the Republic of Serbia, which is currently in the process of joining the European Union and responding to the requirements set by the process of negotiation for Chapter 27 in terms of improving the strategic framework and plans for the education for sustainable development and building the capacities in response to climate change. On the other hand, linking the results of this research with the results of similar studies around the world contributes to the further enrichment of the scientific knowledge base in this field and confirms the need for stronger and united efforts on the path to a sustainable future. It is a fact that, regardless of the national, economic, socio-political and cultural context, there is a global lack of success in shaping a humane and sustainable relationship between man and nature. Therefore, the results of this research should be considered as an invitation for new research initiatives regarding the ways to support the positive attitudes of students towards the concept of sustainable development and to facilitate their further development in the educational process, as well as in other academic domains. Originality/value This research is inspired by the fact that, in the Balkan countries, education for sustainable development has not been extensively discussed within the scientific discourse on higher education for sustainable development. This is one of the first papers to provide data about students' attitudes towards the concept of sustainable development and the need for its implementation in the higher education system in Serbia. The value of the paper lies in its potential to help understand the role that different drivers and barriers play in higher education for sustainable development.

Competencies are used more and more as the starting point for designing curricula and instructional methods, especially in vocational education and training, to realize authentic and self-steering study programmes. Despite its popularity in both research and educational settings, there is no shared understanding of what competence-based education should look like. Earlier work developed a model for competence-based education that outlines eight features that are important for competence-based education. This paper presents a study designed to determine the extent to which the model for competence-based education can be understood and perceived as useful by teachers in vocational education and training in the Netherlands. The study included 12 teams of teachers in the process of designing or re-designing their study programmes to be more competence-based. Teachers reported that the instrument helped them understand the state of affairs of their study programmes, and empowered them to make decisions about the extent to which they want to make these programmes more competence-based.

Aspects of Competence-Based Education as Footholds to Improve the Connectivity Between Learning in School and in the Workplace	VOCATIONS AND LEARNING			English	Article						Competence-based education; Workplace learning; Connectivity; Life sciences	VET	Recent developments in competence-based education have motivated institutions of vocational education and training (VET) to improve the links or connectivity between learning in school and learning in the workplace, which has been a problem for decades. In previous research, a theoretical framework describing the underlying aspects of competence-based education was developed. In this study, three aspects of this framework were used to analyse connectivity between learning in school and learning in the workplace. These aspects were: i) authenticity, ii) selfresponsibility, and iii) the role of the teacher as expert and coach. Three stakeholder groups (i.e., students, teachers, and workplace training supervisors) involved in secondary VET programs in the field of life sciences in the Netherlands were questioned on these aspects. Based on their interviews, it is concluded that these aspects provide information about the process of connectivity. Because stakeholder groups hold different conceptions of workplace learning and often do not communicate adequately about mutual responsibilities, the implementation of these aspects of competence-based education has not significantly improved the connectivity situation. Nevertheless, these aspects of competence-based education can guide stakeholder groups in making clearer agreements about mutual responsibilities, which may improve connectivity in the future.

It examines the extent to which CBE design principles of the Comprehensive Competence-Based Education Framework developed in a Western context exist in Indonesian policy documents and school practices. This study reviews educational policy documents and collects cross-sectional survey data from 41 school principals, 453 teachers, and 2219 students from 41 agricultural vocational schools in five provinces of Java, Indonesia. Results showed that the ten CCBE principles listed in the framework exist to large extent in Indonesian policy documents. School principals, teachers, and students noticed the realisation of CCBE principles in the study programme to differing degrees, except for the principle of flexibility that was largely absent. The level of CBE implementation varied, from the level of starting competence-based to that of largely competence-based education. The findings contribute to the discussion of CCBE design principles and lesson learned of CBE implementation in a non-western perspective.

J	Koenen, AK; Dochy, F; Berghmans, I				Koenen, Anne-Katrien; Dochy, Filip; Berghmans, Inneke			A phenomenographic analysis of the implementation of competence-based education in higher education	TEACHING AND TEACHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Higher education; Competence-based education; Assessment; Phenomenographic analysis	CONCEPTIONS; DEFINITION	After one decade of Competence-Based Education (CBE), the need arises to investigate the experiences and implementation of CBE in contemporary higher education. A phenomenographic analysis using interviews was conducted with three different groups of stakeholders, namely curriculum coordinator, teachers and students at 26 different educational institutions, providing three different types of educational programmes (ICT and Media, Management, Teacher Education). Results suggest that CBE is emerging and that the majority of the institutions designed their education through a mix of traditional and competence-based teaching and assessment methods. Nevertheless, some obstacles appeared as restrictions to succeeding in the further implementation of CBE. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study examines how students (N = 1469) from competence-based and less-competence-based vocational schools perceive their teachers' interpersonal behaviour and its relation with their motivation. Results showed comparable teacher profiles in CBE and less-CBE schools, with an unexpected difference at the dimension level. Perceived teacher interpersonal behaviour moderated connections between CBE and student motivation, with greater impact in less-CBE than in CBE learning environments. Required changes in teacher roles are not yet perceived, hampering the expectations of increased motivation in competence-based education. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Team learning and its association with the implementation of competence-based education	TEACHING AND TEACHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Competence-based education; Team learning; Teacher teams; Team entitativity; Vocational education and training	VOCATIONAL-EDUCATION; TEACHER TEAMS; INTERDEPENDENCE; PERFORMANCE; DIVERSITY; BEHAVIOR; TASK; COLLABORATION; PERSPECTIVES; RELIABILITY	Competence-based education (CBE) is the leading paradigm for education reform of Vocational Education and Training in European countries. This study addresses the association of collective team identification, task interdependence, team learning, and team size, with the implementation of CBE (N = 1008 teachers, 93 teams). Information processing in teams was positively associated with the implementation of CBE. Furthermore, trends revealed that information storage and retrieval, task interdependence, and smaller team sizes were associated with less disagreement within the team about the CBE-level of the educational program. These results provide further insight into the importance of team learning for education reform. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	van Dinther, M; Dochy, F; Segers, M; Braeken, J				van Dinther, Mart; Dochy, Filip; Segers, Mien; Braeken, Johan			The construct validity and predictive validity of a self-efficacy measure for student teachers in competence-based education	STUDIES IN EDUCATIONAL EVALUATION			English	Article						Student evaluation; Student teacher self-efficacy measure; Competence-based education; Evaluation methods	BELIEFS; SENSE; FRAMEWORK; BIFACTOR	This study intends to investigate the validity of a self-efficacy measure which is developed for predictive and diagnostic purposes concerning student teachers in competence-based education. CFA results delivered converging evidence for the multidimensionality of the student teacher self-efficacy construct and the bi-factor model as underlying structure, reflecting a teacher competence framework. Factor loadings of the bifactor model evidenced the theoretical assumption that incipient student teachers enter the programme with a global undifferentiated sense of teacher self-efficacy, having teaching experiences a further differentiation takes place to a partly differentiated sense of teacher self-efficacy. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the measure succeeds in predicting students' first-year outcomes and delivered evidence for the diagnostic value of the scale. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lum, G				Lum, G			Where's the competence in competence-based education and training?	JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION			English	Article								This paper(1) notes the apparent ineffectiveness of the critical response to competence-based education and training (CBET) and suggests that this results from a failure to correctly isolate CBET's unique, identifying features. If is argued that the prevailing tendency to identify CBET with 'competence' is fundamentally mistaken and that the competence approach is more properly characterised in terms of its philosophically naive methodological strategy. It is suggested that this strategy is based upon untenable assumptions relating to the semantic status of statements of outcome and the epistemological and ontological constructs to which such statements are intended to correspond.

J	HYLAND, T				HYLAND, T			PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT AND COMPETENCE-BASED EDUCATION	EDUCATIONAL STUDIES			English	Article								The rapid expansion of competence-based education (CBE) through the work of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ) has now, thanks to generous public funding and official endorsement by the Department for Education, penetrated the theory and practice of professional studies in teacher education at both school and post-school levels. The NCVQ model of CBE is criticised and alternatives described. The current NCVQ approach is neither the only nor necessarily the most appropriate model of occupational development on offer. Models of professionalism based on the concept of 'expertise' are recommended as the ones most likely to produce the reflective practitioners required to enhance the status and quality of teaching in schools and colleges.

J	Geressu, BS				Geressu, Birhane Sime			Impact of competence-based training on employability of Technical and Vocational graduates in Ethiopia	TUNING JOURNAL FOR HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Impact; competences; employability; employment; graduates; training; TVET		The purpose of this study is to critically examine the impact of competence based training on employability of technical and vocational college graduates in Ethiopia. Mixed methods of research design, predominantly concurrent nested strategy were employed to conduct the study. The study involved 162 instructors, 123 Level III automotive technology trainees, 87 department heads and 89 graduates, a total of 461 respondents as a sample. Moreover, 24 respondents (6 industry owners, 6 TVET college deans, 6 competence-based process owners and 6 industry trainers' leaders) were purposely selected for interview and focus group discussion. Under the study, the researcher used employability of graduates as dependent variable and competency based training as independent variable. Descriptive and inferential statistics were employed for data analysis. The study result showed that technical and vocational education and training (TVET) colleges in Ethiopia have been performing below expectations in developing demand-based curriculum and implementing competence-based training in TVET colleges and industries. As a result, among the graduates nearly 50 percent are not employed in the past two years. Hence, it is recommended that constantly consulting and involving relevant stakeholders in setting study profile, identifying intended learning outcomes and strengthening competence based learning style are vital for graduates to demonstrate employability skill, knowledge and attitude into the job that consequentially lead to graduate employment.

Does implementation of competence-based education mediate the impact of team learning on student satisfaction?	JOURNAL OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING			English	Article						Teacher teams; vocational education; student satisfaction; team learning; competence-based education (CBE)	VOCATIONAL-EDUCATION; VET; TEACHERS	Competence-based education (CBE) is an innovation in (vocational) education aimed at improving students' competences. Little is known, however, about the processes leading to successful implementation of CBE and about its outcomes. This study investigates the effects that the level of CBE implementation has on student satisfaction (regarding the quality of education, guidance, and the development of interpersonal and general vocational skills) and to what extent CBE implementation mediates the relationship between teacher team learning activities and student satisfaction. To this end, data was gathered from 662 teachers belonging to 46 teacher teams in senior secondary vocational education in the Netherlands, and their students. Multilevel structural equation modelling revealed that teacher team learning was positively associated with te implementation of CBE. Furthermore, CBE had a positive effect on student satisfaction with quality of education, guidance, and development of interpersonal skills; however, no significant effect was found on student satisfaction with the development of general vocational skills. These results indicate that implementation of CBE has, to some degree, fulfilled its promise of better preparing students for their future workplace and that teacher team learning can support the further implementation of CBE.

J	de Bruijn, E				de Bruijn, Elly			Teaching in innovative vocational education in the Netherlands	TEACHERS AND TEACHING			English	Article						vocational education; competence-based education; teacher roles; personal ideas and professional attitudes of teachers; teaching behaviour		The orientation of vocational education towards competence-based education has led to fundamental changes in the work of vocational education teachers. This article pictures teaching in innovative, competence-based vocational education in the Netherlands. In a multiple case study, the teaching practices of 10 teachers from five vocational schools were thoroughly studied. By examining not only the actual behaviour of teachers but also their related personal ideas and professional attitudes, we learn about the ways teachers implement new educational concepts and their experienced uncertainties, dilemmas and practical tensions. These insights lead to a better understanding and specification of the concept of competence-based vocational education at the micro level of educational processes, that is, the interaction between teachers and students. Implications are described in terms of new repertoires of teaching behaviour and teaching methods - all in the context of vocational education.

J	Clement, P				Clement, Pierre			The introduction of competence-based education into the compulsory school curriculum in France (2002-2017): hybridity and polysemy as conditions for change	COMPARATIVE EDUCATION			English	Article						Competence; school curriculum; France; pedagogy; progressive education; new public management; education reform		In France, the notion of competence began to be discussed in the early 1990s and was finally enforced in the Education Act of 23 April 2005. Since its emergence, this notion has been strongly opposed by a certain number of teachers, unions and researchers. To understand how competence-based education finally prevailed, I take into account the fundamentally polysemic nature of this notion. After pointing out its origins, I examine how its different meanings have been synthesised within the Common Core established in 2005. I then study the contradictions to which the implementation of this hybrid object has given rise, before analysing the new compromise that was found in the 2015 reform. To do this, I use the data from numerous archives and a series of interviews with the main actors of curriculum reforms in France since the 1980s.

J	Virkkula, E				Virkkula, Esa			Student teachers' views of competence goals in vocational teacher education	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TEACHER EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						Competence-based education; learning objectives; student teacher; coaching; student mentoring	LEARNING OUTCOMES; SELF-ASSESSMENT; FEEDBACK; KNOWLEDGE	Competence-based education (CBE) is an international educational trend and a core issue in developing Finnish vocational upper secondary and higher education. The theory and practice of the competence-based approach should preferably be included in vocational teacher studies. Yet, there are still relatively few organisations implementing competence-based vocational teacher education in Finland. This article examines the realisation of competence-based vocational teacher education. The small-scale mixed-method case study explains the student teachers' conceptions of the competence goals in their studies. The competence goals describe the competencies to be achieved as a result of training. According to the research findings, competence goals clarify the student teachers' understanding of the demands of a teacher's work, facilitate students to reflect on their competences and help in preparing individual study plans and promoting their studies. However, the student teachers need university teachers' guidance to get their studies started and to promote the competences flexibly.

J	Palsa, L; Mertala, P				Palsa, Lauri; Mertala, Pekka			Disciplinary contextualisation of transversal competence in Finnish local curricula: the case of multiliteracy, mathematics, and social studies	EDUCATION INQUIRY			English	Article						Competence-based education; curriculum; curricular contextualisation; mathematics; multiliteracy; social studies	LITERACY; LEARNERS; PEDAGOGY	Competence-based education is a widely implemented educational approach, but more research is needed into the relationship between transversal competences and individual disciplines. In this article, we present the results of a study focusing on how the transversal competence of multiliteracy is contextually defined in Finnish local curricula in the disciplines of mathematics and social studies. The article offers new insights into the discussion between content- and competence-based educations by introducing the concept of disciplinary contextualisation. Based on the qualitatively analysed data, four different types of disciplinary contextualisation are presented and further discussed. The study also engages with the discussion in the field of multiliteracy by offering insights into the ways in which multiliteracy is rationalised, defined, and developed in the analysed disciplines. Multiliteracy contextualisations share features, but also differences, between the disciplines, illustrating the importance of taking into account the disciplinary perspective when discussing the development of competences in basic education.

J	van Dinther, M; Dochy, F; Segers, M; Braeken, J				van Dinther, Mart; Dochy, Filip; Segers, Mien; Braeken, Johan			Student perceptions of assessment and student self-efficacy in competence-based education	EDUCATIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						assessment characteristics; self-efficacy; student perceptions; competence-based assessment; perceptions of assessment	BELIEFS; FRAMEWORK; PERFORMANCE; TEACHERS; POWER	The purpose of this study was to provide insight into the interplay between student perceptions of competence-based assessment and student self-efficacy, and how this influences student learning outcomes. Results reveal that student perceptions of the form authenticity aspect and the quality feedback aspect of assessment do predict student self-efficacy, confirming the role of mastery experiences and social persuasions in enhancing student self-efficacy as stated by social cognitive theory. Findings do not confirm mastery experiences as being a stronger source of self-efficacy information than social persuasions. Study results confirm the predictive role of students' self-efficacy on their competence outcomes. Mediation analysis results indicate that student's perceptions of assessment have an indirect effect on student's competence evaluation outcomes through student's self-efficacy. Study findings highlight which assessment characteristics, positively influencing students' learning, contribute to the effectiveness of competence-based education. Limitations of the study and directions for future research are indicated.

Competence strategies serve to de-skill and de-professionalise teaching and other public-service occupations by their technicist and reductionist approach to human values and knowledge. Educators committed to liberal values should eschew competence strategies in favour of learning theories inspired by the experiential tradition.

The role of schools' perceived human resource policies in teachers' professional development activities: a comparative study of innovations toward competence-based education	ASIA PACIFIC EDUCATION REVIEW			English	Article						Continuing Teacher Development; Professional Development; Human Resource Policies; Competence-Based Vocational Education		The change toward competence-based education has implications for teachers as well as school management. This study investigates which professional development activities teachers undertake related to this change and how these activities differ among schools with various human resource (HR) policies. Two types of HR policy were involved: (1) a government-enforced, national system of Integrated Personnel Management and (2) a voluntary, integrative approach of Schooling of teachers, Organizational development of schools and teacher training institutes, Action- and development-oriented research, and Professional development of teachers. Semi-structured interviews with 30 teachers in nine schools with different HR policies were held and analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Findings show that teachers undertake professional development activities in five categories: maintaining knowledge base, applying and experimenting, reflection, collaboration, and activities indirectly related to teaching practice. Teachers' professional development activities were found to be relatively similar across schools with different HR policies. It is concluded that neither government-enforced nor voluntary HR policies seem to play much of a role in the participation by teachers in professional development activities. Implications for further research and school practice are discussed.

J	Misbah, Z; Gulikers, J; Mulder, M				Misbah, Zainun; Gulikers, Judith; Mulder, Martin			Competence and knowledge development in competence-based vocational education in Indonesia	LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS RESEARCH			English	Article						Agriculture vocational education; Competence-based education; Competence development; Indonesia; Knowledge development		Theory and research in the field of competence-based vocational education (CBVE) have advanced enormously during the last decades, although empirical research on CBVE lags far behind. CBVE researchers have complained about the lack of evidence that CBVE results in better competence development, the decreasing attention for knowledge development in CBVE practice, and the cross-sectional nature of much CBVE research. This study addresses these issues by reviewing a worldwide competence-based education literature and comparing competence and knowledge development of students in vocational schools in Indonesia that have implemented principles of CBVE to a higher or lesser degree. The study involved 506 students majoring in food processing and technology and 32 teachers from 11 agricultural secondary vocational schools. Teachers and students rated student competence levels. Student knowledge was assessed with a multiple-choice test. Longitudinal data were collected during one school year at three points of time. Student competence development in high-CBVE was higher than in low-CBVE, suggesting that the implementation of CBVE was successful and had a motivating effect of both students and teachers in Indonesian vocational schools. However, knowledge development was indeed lower in high-CBVE than in low-CBVE, which needs further attention.

J	Benatuil, D; Laurito, MJ				Benatuil, Denise; Laurito, Maria Juliana			Specific competences in the Tuning Latin America Project: their degree of importance and achievement among a sample of psychology students	TUNING JOURNAL FOR HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						competences; training; Tuning; psychology; students		The implementation of the competence-based education approach at university level is a vehicle for the global transformation of the current Higher Education system. Over the past few decades, psychology has increasingly focused on the identification of core competences in the education of psychologists. The U.S., Canada and Europe have adopted competence-based education approaches. More recently, in 2013 the Tuning Latin America Project introduced the challenge to reach agreement on the education of psychologists in the region. The purpose of this research is to analyse the degree of importance and perceived achievement of the specific competences set out in the Tuning Latin America Project, among a sample of 100 advanced psychology students of a private university in the City of Buenos Aires. For such purpose, the Specific Competences Survey for students of the Tuning Latin America Project was used. All the competences obtained high ratings in terms of importance, in particular those related to professional ethics. In addition, the respondents considered that most of the competences are thoroughly developed during their university training. To conclude, further studies and analyses need to be carried out in order to identify current educational needs for psychologists and thus enhance quality and adjust psychological practice to current social needs.

J	Bridges, D				Bridges, D			Competence-based education and training: Progress or villainy?	JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION			English	Article								This paper notes the critical response that the 'competence movement' has received from writers in philosophy of education and argues for a more positive assessment of what it offers in relation to. (i) the place of practical competence in a liberal education, (ii) the meritocratic principles underlying the competence movement, (iii) the 'transparency' of expectations in assessment, and even (iv) the element of practical competence in moral performance. It emphasises, however, that not all versions of 'competence' can be defended in these terms and that this requires a more generic and cognitively laden concept of personal and professional competence.

Design: This research is a comparative analysis of two groups. The first group consists of undergraduate and graduate students majoring in agriculture who are members and non-members of student cooperatives (n = 256). The second group consists of agricultural faculty members (n = 59). Findings: The results of this study show that students and teachers have different views with regard to the extent to which CBE principles are practiced in the College of Agriculture. Moreover, students with different learning patterns had different perceptions regarding the extent to which CBE is practiced, whereas teachers with different teaching patterns had the same perception of the application of CBE principles in the College of Agriculture. Practical implications: This study has practical implications for agricultural higher education in general and colleges of agriculture in particular. Colleges of agriculture across Iran could encourage their students to establish and engage in student cooperatives so that the 'what' and 'how' aspects of CBE are put into practice. Theoretical implications: This study has theoretical implications for CBE principles. For example, student cooperatives can be utilized by faculty members as one of the main strategies for developing CBE in agricultural colleges. Originality/value: This study is original in that it moves from theory to practice when considering CBE.

J	Burchell, H				Burchell, H			Facilitating action research for curriculum development in higher education	INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING INTERNATIONAL			English	Article								An action research approach to curriculum development was used within a national funded project in radiography education. Its particular focus was the development of a competence-based approach to the clinical education and assessment of student radiographers. This paper explores the role of a facilitator of action research in such a context through examining key dilemmas that are presented. These concern the need to balance the search for pragmatic local solutions with strategies informed by national debates in the field of competence-based education and training; the balance of time between reflection and action in action research; and the tension between local solutions and national recommendations.

J	Hwang, SW; Kwon, YA				Hwang, Sung Won; Kwon, Young Ae			An Exploration of Curriculum Development Directions Through an Analysis of University Students' Awareness of Core Competence	ASIA-PACIFIC EDUCATION RESEARCHER			English	Article						Concept of talent; Core competence; Measurement tool; Competence-based education		To realize competence-based education in the university, the goals of the curriculum should be described according to competence, while measurement and performance should be managed using appropriate core competence diagnostic tools. The purpose of this study is therefore to identify and explore the improvement directions of curriculum through core competence diagnosis. To achieve this, preliminary and follow-up surveys were conducted using offline questionnaires with students in the Department of Library and Information Science. According to the results of the analysis of this core competence diagnosis, the weakest competence was glocal competence, which was found to be statistically significant (t=9.095, p<.000). Among the four sub-factors of glocal competence, the ability to use foreign languages was the least developed (t=-25.286, p<.0001). There is a need to promote a variety of experiences and organize a program that develops confidence in students to converse with foreigners or to write what they wish in a foreign language. The result of the analysis of differences in the individual core competencies of Library and Information Science students showed that 33 (82.5%) of 40 students had a statistically significant difference in student competence, indicating that student learning core competence had somewhat improved. This study analyzed the difference in awareness of core competence through pre- and post-diagnosis using the self-core-competence measurement tool. By exploring, developing, and providing customized curriculum according to student needs based on this tool, it is expected that self-directed student participation and core competence can be increased.

The case of Rwanda, as a late adopter, shows that at this stage of pedagogy diffusion the influence of global mechanisms and actors has been amplified. This study draws upon interviews with key stakeholders and relevant documents during the 2011-2016 period. The transfer process is examined by analysing the rationale offered and mechanisms deployed by the Rwandan government and aid agencies.

Eleven case studies were conducted, including observation of lessons and interviews with teachers and students. The results show that schools meet various fundamental issues in realising this approach. A crucial question is how to stimulate the acquisition and use of a way of knowing and thinking that is based on vocational theory. Reflection, authenticity and coaching are relevant characteristics that are hardly put into practice yet. To understand these results the article reflects on factors that account for the distance between promising concepts and actual teaching practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hyland, T				Hyland, T			Professionalism, ethics and work-based learning	BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						professionalism; deprofessionalisation; competences; work-based learning		Recent policy developments within the public service sector have led to widespread de-professionalisation and a general loss of motivation and morale within education, health and social work. This state of affairs has been brought about by the imposition of a social market on public sector professions and through the introduction of competence-based education and training (CBET) strategies into professional studies. These developments are criticised for their failure to capture the essential epistemological and moral dimensions of the work of professionals, and programmes for professional regeneration are recommended through the renewed emphasis on the workplace as the site of professional learning. Work-based learning may enable professionals to re-affirm the importance of experiential learning and reinforce the centrality of the ethical bases of professional practice.

J	Ladenheim, RI; Hernandez, CI				Ines Ladenheim, Roberta; Ines Hernandez, Cecilia			Medical Educators' conceptions about Generic Competences in Argentina: Contributions for consensus building	TUNING JOURNAL FOR HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Competence-based education; competence frameworks; Tuning Project; generic competences; discipline-specific competences; conceptions; human resources in healthcare		Healthcare professionals' education is evolving to meet people's needs towards a more comprehensive, collaborative and interdisciplinary training. In medical education in Argentina, in the context of international discussions around competence-based education (CBE), competence frameworks are being developed for undergraduate and postgraduate education, constituting agreed criteria that lead to the design of training programs and work as key tools to ensure educational quality. The Tuning Project and other international frameworks account for this process towards a common definition of standards beyond geographic and disciplinary boundaries. Generic competences (GCs) have acquired increased relevance in CBE discussions, whereas in medical education they involve key skills for patient safety - yet clarity in their implementation still has to be accomplished. In competence-based medical education (CBME), some changes are being hindered by the absence of a common language as well as diverging ideologies and theories. The purpose of this work was to explore conceptions and the terms used when referring to GCs by people in charge of educational planning and design of Human Resources (HR) training policies in Argentina. A qualitative exploratory study was conducted based on semi-structured interviews to key informants from different levels and fields in medical education. Interviews were conducted by one interviewer and analysed by two independent researchers. Results showed that medical educational planners have different conceptions regarding GCs and fail to share a common language to enunciate them. They acknowledge their relevance for patient safety and agree with the notion that, at this time of educational transformation, it would be useful to enunciate them separately from specific competences, although they realise that this involves potential risks in curricular design. From all terms used in this regard, "generic competence" was identified as a contradiction in itself. Consensus on denomination, meaning and visibility in curricula is mandatory.

J	van Dinther, M; Dochy, F; Segers, M				van Dinther, Mart; Dochy, Filip; Segers, Mien			The contribution of assessment experiences to student teachers' self-efficacy in competence-based education	TEACHING AND TEACHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Self-efficacy; Formative assessment; Assessment characteristics; Assessment experiences; Teacher education; Types of self-efficacy information	PERCEPTIONS; BELIEFS; FEEDBACK; ACHIEVEMENT; ANTECEDENTS; SKILL; SENSE	Earlier research argues that educational programmes based on social cognitive theory are successful in improving students' self-efficacy. Focussing on some formative assessment characteristics, this qualitative research intends to study in-depth how student teachers' assessment experiences contribute to their self-efficacy. We interviewed 15 s year student teachers enrolled in a competence based teacher educational programme. Thematic content analysis results reveal that the assessment characteristics 'authenticity' and 'feedback' exert a positive influence on student teachers self-efficacy during all phases of the portfolio competence assessment. The results provide a fine-grained view of several types of self-efficacy information connected with these assessment phases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This experience has been developed within the institutional framework of the call for educational projects aimed at designing and implementing new teaching and assessment methods, primarily focused on competence-based training, convened by the Vice President for Teaching and European Convergence. The data collection and evaluation of the teaching innovation was carried out in two phases: the first with an assembly or initial discussion of expectations at the beginning of the course, and a final assessment with a questionnaire at the end of the experience.

J	HYLAND, T				HYLAND, T			EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING, COMPETENCE AND CRITICAL PRACTICE IN HIGHER-EDUCATION	STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article								The expanding influence of competence-based education (CBE) through the activities of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ) now extends to all levels of the system, including the work of higher education institutions. The NCVQ approach is, however, ill-equipped to deal with education and training beyond the level of basic skills, and is largely irrelevant to the sort of learning that goes on in higher education. A critique of the NCVQ model of CBE is presented and, in place of the behaviourist obsession with performance outcomes, models of learning and development drawn from the cognitive and experimental tradition are recommended for higher education. Educators in this sphere need to maintain an attachment to critical practice and the humanistic tradition in order to resist the narrow utilitarian models of practice represented by CBE strategies.

J	Hyland, T				Hyland, T			Exporting failure: the strange case of NVQs and overseas markets	EDUCATIONAL STUDIES			English	Article								At a time when Britain's vocational education and training (VET) system and vocational qualifications are undergoing a major review and restructuring in response to critical reports about the model established tinder the former National Council for Vocational Qualifications, the British Council and associated agencies is currently trying to market National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) overseas. The chief weaknesses and failings of NVQs and the competence-based education and training (CBET) system on which they are based are outlined in terms of assessment anomalies and the needs of firms, trainees and employers. Since these shortcomings are so so serious, it is suggested that-until they have been remedied through the current reforms under the aegis of the new Qualifications and Curriculum Authority-it is ethically unjustifiable to export a failed VET system to countries which may be unaware of the critical research surrounding NVQs and CBET.

J	HYLAND, T				HYLAND, T			MORALITY, WORK AND EMPLOYMENT - TOWARDS A VALUES DIMENSION IN VOCATIONAL-EDUCATION AND TRAINING	JOURNAL OF MORAL EDUCATION			English	Article								The marginalisation and neglect of values education at school level in England as a result of the pressures of the National Curriculum has been paralleled in post-16 education by the spread of the competence-based education and training (CBET) strategy which underpins the increasingly influential work of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ). This approach to vocational education and training (VET), if it allows for attention to values at all, results in a technical-instrumental approach in which morality is interpreted as a ''competence'' designed to serve the needs of industry. lit place of such an approach, an ''education for work'' programme-based on a Deweyan conception of vocationalism-is outlined, and full attention to the values dimension of work and employment is suggested. It is recommended that such a values-based education for work core should form part of the 14-19 curriculum for all students.

J	STEVENSON, J; BROWN, I				STEVENSON, J; BROWN, I			AUSTRALIAN TAFE ASSESSMENT PRACTICES - CONFUSING RELEVANCE AND RESPONSIVENESS	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION			English	Article						COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT; PROBLEM SOLVING; STUDENT ASSESSMENT; COMPETENCE BASED EDUCATION; SKILL DEVELOPMENT; TECHNICAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION		There are two contrasting world views discernible in contemporary Australian government skill-formation literature: one which recognises the need for the development of underlying cognitive structures and interpersonal attributes for the workplace, and one which values the development of pre-specified observable skills, as in competency-based training. This study examines TAFE assessment practices across Australia, as an indicator of the extent to which each view is represented in practice. The study found that, for initial vocational courses, some practices accord more with the latter world view than with the former; but, for non-vocational courses, there was a greater balance in approaches to assessment and relatively more emphasis on assessing some increasingly important workplace attributes. The implications of some current practices are that TAFE graduates entering the workforce may be inept when required to adapt, solve problems or innovate.

It allows the efficient development of measuring instruments for computer science education. Cpm.4.CSE/IRT consists of four sub processes: B1 determine items, B2 test items, B3 analyze items according to Rasch model, and B4 interpret items by criteria. Cpm.4.CSE/IRT is modeled in IDEF0, a process modeling language that is standardized and widely used. It is implemented in R, an open-source software optimized for statistical calculations and graphics that allows users to interact using the web application framework Shiny. Through coordinated processes, cpm.4.CSE/IRT ensures the quality and comparability of test instruments in competence measurement. Cpm.4.CSE/IRT is demonstrated using an example from the competence area of Modeling.

J	Almarghani, EM; Mijatovic, I				Almarghani, Eman M.; Mijatovic, Ivana			Factors affecting student engagement in HEIs - it is all about good teaching	TEACHING IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Student engagement; higher education; active learning	COMPETENCE-BASED EDUCATION; QUALITY-ASSURANCE SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY GOVERNANCE; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; INVOLVEMENT; PARTICIPATION; INSTRUCTION; ACHIEVEMENT; PERCEPTIONS; INTEGRATION	The passive role of students in their learning and education and the absence of student engagement in higher education institutions (HEIs) are quite common in many higher education institutions in developing countries. The main objective of the research presented in this paper is to explore the influential factors on student engagement in HEIs in the situational frame where student engagement and active learning and teaching do not have a long tradition. To answer our research questions, we conducted a survey with 279 undergraduate students from four universities in Libya. Our findings show that the availability and active usage of the university's ICTs resources, the university's reputation and teachers' activating influence on students most efficiently predict student engagement in HEIs. The role of teachers and their competencies to use active learning techniques are perceived to be very influential in promoting student engagement.

It includes eight subprocesses: (a) determine competence concept, (b) determine competence areas, (c) identify computer science concepts, (d) assign competence dimensions to computer science, (e) code competences, (f) formulate competences, (g) formulate learning tasks, and (h) formulate test tasks. The competence definition by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development gives the direction to cpm.4.CSE. This definition highlights four main dimensions of competence: knowledge, cognitive skills, practical skills, and attitudes. For the preparation of subprocesses and the exemplification of concepts, references have been used from the academic literature of computer science education. The processes, activities, and transformations of cpm.4.CSE are documented in Integration Definition for Function Modeling, a process modeling language that is standardized, widely used and easy to understand.

Web-based support was developed with three supportive aids: A construction kit, a phenomenarium, and an information bank. Each supportive aid was expected to improve perceived process and product quality as well as learning. In a full factorial experiment, 266 educational science students constructed a competence map, whether or not supported by different combinations of the three supportive aids. The availability of the construction kit and the phenomenarium had positive effects on perceived process quality and learning. Furthermore, if there was no phenomenarium with example materials, the absence of the construction kit greatly diminished experienced support (i.e., one aspect of process quality); if a phenomenarium was present, the availability of the construction kit had relatively little effect on perceived support. In general, this study indicates that well-designed Web-based support helps to construct competence maps.

J	Barrett, M				Barrett, Martyn			The Council of Europe's Reference Framework of Competences for Democratic Culture: Policy context, content and impact	LONDON REVIEW OF EDUCATION			English	Article						citizenship education; human rights education; intercultural education; competence-based education; intercultural dialogue	EDUCATION	The Council of Europe's Reference Framework of Competences for Democratic Culture (RFCDC) was published in April 2018, and is currently being implemented in a number of Council of Europe member states. The RFCDC consists of three main components: a conceptual model of the competences that learners need to acquire in order to respond appropriately and effectively to democratic and intercultural situations; validated and scaled descriptors and learning outcomes for all of the competences in the model; and guidance for ministries of education and education practitioners on curriculum, pedagogy, assessment, teacher education, the whole-school approach, and building learners' resilience to radicalization. This article describes the policy background that motivated and accompanied the development of the RFCDC, and the process through which it was developed. It also provides an overview of the contents of the RFCDC, and an explanation of the impact that the framework is beginning to have on Council of Europe actions in the sphere of formal education.

For a sample of Indonesian students, this study examined the connection between two dimensions of teacher interpersonal behaviour (proximity and influence) and student competency levels, as well as whether or not these relations are mediated by students' intrinsic motivation. Additionally, it examined if these relations differed in learning environments with high versus low characteristics of competence-based education (HCBE vs. LCBE). Three questionnaires responded to by 506 first-year students were analysed using multigroups structural equation modelling. Teacher cooperative behaviour affected student motivation positively, and the influence was stronger in LCBE learning environments. Teacher controlling behaviour reduced student-perceived competency levels, with the reduction stronger in HCBE learning environments. Implications of the findings for teaching and learning in vocational education are discussed.

J	Barman, L; Silen, C; Laksov, KB				Barman, Linda; Silen, Charlotte; Laksov, Klara Bolander			Outcome based education enacted: teachers' tensions in balancing between student learning and bureaucracy	ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION			English	Article						Outcome- and competency-based education; Instructional design; Policy enactment; Educational change; Curriculum change	COMPETENCE-BASED EDUCATION; GUIDE NO. 14; MEDICAL-EDUCATION; DEFINITIONS; CURRICULUM; CRITIQUE; MODEL	This paper reports on how teachers within health sciences education translate outcome-based education (OBE) into practice when they design courses. The study is an empirical contribution to the debate about outcome- and competency-based approaches in health sciences education. A qualitative method was used to study how teachers from 14 different study programmes designed courses before and after OBE was implemented. Using an interpretative approach, analysis of documents and interviews was carried out. The findings show that teachers enacted OBE either to design for more competency-oriented teaching-learning, or to further detail knowledge and thus move towards reductionism. Teachers mainly understood the outcome-based framework as useful to support students' learning, although the demand for accountability created tension and became a bureaucratic hindrance to design for development of professional competence. The paper shows variations of how teachers enacted the same outcome-based framework for instructional design. These differences can add a richer understanding of how outcome- or competency-based approaches relate to teaching-learning at a course level.

J	Fringe, JJD				dos Santos Fringe, Jorge Jaime			Promoting holistic learning for the development of competences in Mozambique	TUNING JOURNAL FOR HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						competence-based education; constructivist learning; learning style flexibility; multiple intelligences; holistic learning styles; whole-brain model	HIGHER-EDUCATION	This article presents results of a study carried out at the Faculty of Education of the University Eduardo Mondlane, in Mozambique, aimed to assess the extent to which the bachelor course in Psychology promotes multiple intelligences as superimposed to holistic learning styles within its effort to develop students' competences. For that purpose, 158 psychology students were invited to fill in a four-point Likert scale questionnaire. Respondents were asked to gauge lecturers' practices of employing different methods and strategies to promote multiple intelligences and holistic learning styles and to indicate what their preferences were concerning methods that could be employed more often. Results show that lecturers promote holistic learning, despite prominence of practices that are more tied to logical and analytical skills, in the left hemisphere, with less emphasis on right hemisphere processes such as ludic activities, drama and simulations, and physical involvement. Such results point to the need for the promotion of professional development efforts towards increased adoption of more holistic learning and multiple intelligences within the bachelor course in Psychology.

J	HYLAND, T				HYLAND, T			TILTING AT WINDMILLS - THE PROBLEMS OF CHALLENGING THE NATIONAL-COUNCIL-FOR-VOCATIONAL-QUALIFICATIONS	EDUCATIONAL STUDIES			English	Article								The recent Smithers critique of the role of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ) has opened up the debate about the effectiveness of this system for achieving the current goals of upgrading vocational studies and reforming the 14-19 curriculum. It is argued that, although Smithers is broadly correct in his attack on the NCVQ, there are some areas of ambiguity and also ways in which the critique fails to capture the full scope of the problems. The nature and full implications of the inappropriateness of the NCVQ enterprise is illustrated through an examination of the main weaknesses of National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) and the competence-based education and training (CBET) strategy which underpins them and, in particular, by reviewing some specific problems of learning and assessment and the findings of a number of recent critical studies. In view of the seriousness of these shortcomings of the NCVQ system it is suggested that perhaps the only genuine solution to the current difficulties lies in the recommendations of the 1993 National Commission on Education report for the abolition of the present system of academic and vocational qualifications.

In this paper, a teaching intervention that is based on design methodologies is proposed, to upgrade the competitive capacities of computer engineering students. In particular, this intervention targets those aspects relating to working in multidisciplinary teams and to defining requirements based on the user's empathy and knowledge. The main idea inspiring this technique is that the underlying challenge is a communication problem. As Brooks (1995) states in his book The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering, even a project having all of the prerequisites for success (a clear mission, manpower, materials, time and adequate technology) could fail as a Tower of Babel. The proposed technique through mixed methods has been evaluated with students enrolled in different courses, confirming the repeatability and validity of this method from quantitative measurement, from observation of the results, and from ascertaining the value perceived by students and their attitudes.

The relationship between perceived competence and earned credits in competence-based higher education	ASSESSMENT & EVALUATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						self-regulation; motivation; deep approach to learning; earned credits; perceived competence	ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; MOTIVATION; STUDENT; BELIEFS	We explored how two types of study outcomes, perceived competence and earned credits, are interrelated, and influenced by self-regulation, motivation (intrinsic value and expectancy of procrastination) and deep approach to learning. The relationships between these variables were analysed in a sample of 894 first-year Dutch university students, using linear structural modelling. Results show that learning process factors play other roles in explaining perceived competence than in explaining earned credits. Perceived competence and earned credits, as two sides of the same coin in competence-based education, are only weakly related. Furthermore, this study shows that it is most likely that perceived competence affects earned credits, but a model in which earned credits affects perceived competence as possible causal relationship was also accepted, although the relationship remains weak. The practical implication of this study is that, as long as perceived competence and the number of credits are not related, competence-based higher education will not obtain optimal efficiency. For participants and researchers in higher education, it remains important to be aware that different learning goals may evoke different study behaviours in students, and the challenge for higher education is to align these goals.

Students are now more than ever the axis around which the university system orbits. The competences that students should acquire during their studies include transversal competences, which are those competences related to leadership skills, problem solving, and teamwork, highly valued by labor market. This is particularly important in engineering, as these skills can influence the selection of one candidate over another. So, the evaluation and teaching of these kinds of competences are now some of the main challenges facing university professors as the corresponding learning objectives need to be set and assessed, both for study programs as well as for each individual subject, and this process is new for teachers. Focusing precisely on this aspect, our work, based on an empirical study conducted with a sample of 102 engineering students from the University Center of Merida, uses a tool to measure the progress of such students in different transversal competences. This tool not only allows us to evaluate the level of competence development, but also allows us to detect students' areas of weakness in cross-curricular training that can then be addressed.

J	ECCLESTONE, K				ECCLESTONE, K			DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND PURPOSES - THE OVERLOOKED CHALLENGE OF COMPETENCE	EDUCATIONAL STUDIES			English	Article								Interest in professional development based on competence-based education and training (CBET) is growing. Competence models undoubtedly pose some important, constructive challenges to traditional arrangements for developing knowledge and expertise at all occupational levels. However, CBET's impact goes far beyond this. Its processes profoundly affect how teachers and learners view learning, assessment and the purposes of education itself. CBET is also symptomatic of wider changes in notions about ownership, pluralism and breadth in post-compulsory education and training. It therefore poses a profound and forceful ideological challenge to particular educational values, and to the way teachers approach their professional role. This article uses post-16 teacher education as a focus for exploring some of these wider effects. It reviews recent critiques of CBET and argues that many are preoccupied with attempting to improve its efficiency at the expense of examining the wider political and ideological context in which it is being implemented. In order to counter the drift towards a narrow utilitarian curriculum in all sectors of the post-compulsory system, analyses of CBET will need to show its powerful effect on some important democratic traditions in learning and education. This would provide the basis for a more coherent model of professional development than the limited and fragmented choices currently on offer.

J	Leal, MS; Gomez, MLO; Toma, RB				Sanz Leal, Maria; Orozco Gomez, Martha Lucia; Bogdan Toma, Radu			CONCEPTUAL CONSTRUCTION OF GLOBAL COMPETENCE IN EDUCATION	TEORIA DE LA EDUCACION			English	Article						educational theories; global competence; intercultural education; global citizenship education; competence-based education; transformative education		Global competence as a learning objective has become relevant since its inclusion in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Despite the growing interest in this competence, there are several issues requiring deep reflection, such as: What is global competence? How has it been constructed? From which approaches are the discursive processes for its construction based? And, what does intercultural education contribute to this construct? To answer these questions, this paper analyses the background, conceptualisations, approaches and theories on which the concept has been built, with special emphasis on interculturality as an educational approach and model that favours inclusion. The method used is a critical review and discursive analysis. It has been found that the instrumentalist approach to social efficiency has predominated in the conceptualisation, (at least as the underlying approach), as opposed to an approach of social re-constructionism that usually appears in the foreground. On many occasions the global competence and intercultural competence constructs are used interchangeably, although the former is more comprehensive in addressing the challenges of globalisation. Finally, it is highlighted that there are conceptual and measurement challenges and limitations that make it difficult to compare the acquisition of this competence at an international level and that therefore require more studies that systematically investigate the construction of the concept, its development and measurement.

Development and validation of the professional sense of competence scale (ProSOCS) for practitioners who treat disruptive behaviours in children	HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING			English	Article; Early Access						Self-efficacy; Practitioners; Measurement development; Disruptive behaviours; Sense of competence	SELF-EFFICACY; PARENTING SENSE; MENTAL-HEALTH; PERFORMANCE; RELIABILITY; CARE; VALIDITY; MODEL	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a measure of practitioner sense of competence when treating children with disruptive behaviours. Design/methodology/approach Two online surveys were conducted with health, social work and psychology practitioners (n = 113 and n = 239, respectively) working within varied Australian clinical settings. Study 1 developed scale items and conducted an exploratory factor analysis of the initial Professional Sense of Competence Scale (ProSOCS). Study 2 conducted confirmatory factor analysis and tested the construct validity of the scale. Findings Study 1 established a three-factor model, which accounted for 56.9% of variance in the ProSOCS items. Study 2 confirmed the three-factor model and considered an alternative unidimensional model. Study 2 demonstrated good convergent validity with measures of knowledge and general sense of competence. Originality/value The ProSOCS is a valid and reliable way to measure three subscales of a more global composite score of practitioner sense of competence when treating children with disruptive behaviours. Disruptive behaviour represents one of the most common reasons for child presentation in mental health care settings. Understanding how sense of competence among professionals who treat disruptive behaviours in children relates to their level of training, treatment decisions and outcomes could help to enhance use of evidence-based treatment strategies and complement strategies for measuring competence-based training in post-graduate settings.

J	Spruit, M				Spruit, Marcel			Information security education based on job profiles and the e-CF	HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING			English	Article						Higher vocational education; Information security; Job profile; Competence; e-Competence Framework	COMPETENCE-BASED EDUCATION; GUIDANCE; CAREER	Purpose The information security field requires standardised education. This could be based on generic job profiles and a standard competence framework. The question is whether this is possible and feasible. To find out, the author did a case study: developing an information security master curriculum based on a generic PVIB job profile and the underlying competence framework e-CF. Design/methodology/approach The research is a case study, using Design Science. Starting point is the specification of the learning goals for a cybersecurity master curriculum, using a generic PvIB job profile and the underlying competence framework e-CF. The curriculum has subsequently been developed, using backward design. Thereafter, the curriculum has been submitted for accreditation to test the successfulness of the approach. Findings A generic job profile and a competence framework such as the e-CF support the development of standardised education. The generic PVIB job profile used works well. The e-CF can be useful, but requires modifications and the introduction of sub-competences. However, the main complaint concerning the e-CF is the use of examples instead of mandatory content. Originality/value Competence frameworks are available to formulate job descriptions, and are also suited for developing standardised education. Little research has been done on this. This case study shows that a competence framework is a useful tool for developing standardised education, although the e-CF may not be the most appropriate.

J	Hayes, NA; Fry, ST; Cummings, K				Hayes, Nicholas Alexander; Fry, Steffanie Triller; Cummings, Kamilah			Designing a Writing Program for non-traditional adult students: a case study (HETL Scotland 2017)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Higher education; Andragogy; Adult education; HETL; Writing Programs; Competence-based education		Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe, reflect on, and problematize the curricula and student support created by the Writing Program at DePaul University's School for New Learning. This case study discusses the challenges and considerations that the authors have used to develop writing classes and support for non-traditional adult students. Design/methodology/approach This qualitative case study emerges from the practical experience and theoretical knowledge of the three authors. The experience includes development, implementation, and revision of curricula and support services to fit the changing needs of the non-traditional student population. Findings The growing majority of students demonstrate at least one non-traditional characteristic: delayed postsecondary education enrollment, lack of high school diploma, part-time enrollment, full-time employment, multiple dependents besides a spouse, etc. In the face of institutional indifference, these populations frequently fail to receive the support that meets their particular needs. Practical implications Using their own experience of creating a Writing Program that meets the needs of adult non-traditional students, the authors discuss practical strategies for and possible pitfalls of providing writing support that can be adapted for similarly underserved student populations. Originality/value The paper does present interesting approaches for educating adult students.

Fostering diagnostic competencies in psychology teachers is crucial for dealing with different challenges in their professional activities. Through literature analysis, this study generalized approaches towards the definition of the diagnostic competence of psychology teachers and outlined the key components of its formation. It was proved that in order to enable psychology students to successfully handle the increasingly complex tasks in their future professional activities, it is necessary to purposefully model these professional activities and enhance their competencies in the university setting. The aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate an activation approach to the diagnostic competencies of psychology teachers that have actual relevance for their future professional work. The study on 78 firstto fourth-year students obtaining a degree in Psychology was carried out in two steps. In the first phase, 9 levels of diagnostic competence were measured. In the second phase, a practical seminar on pedagogic diagnostics was developed and tested. Through correlation, the connection between applied diagnostic knowledge and diagnostic competence was determined. The one-tailed significance test was justified by the relatively high consistencies (Cronbach's alpha) on the pre-test (0.75) and post-test (0.91). The number of participants with Level-9 diagnostic competence increased to 36 % on a post-test. The current competence-based training framework may be used in higher educational institutions to enhance the diagnostic competence of future psychology teachers.

Taking a competence-based approach, the proposed coaching practice aims to enhance students' employability competences to facilitate a smoother school-to-work transition. However, what transition coaching looks like remains largely unclear. Moreover, in competence-based education, teachers are expected to be highly skilled coaches, facilitating students' transition to the labour market. The present study aims to map the core competencies of a transition coach. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative design was adopted to map the core competences of a transition coach. Data were collected from two focus groups, consisting of coaches in higher education and in the workplace. Findings Results show that, to create the necessary support conditions, a coach creates a safe coaching environment and supports students in setting goals, guide them in the activities they undertake to attain these goals, and asks reflective questions. Moreover, the coach stimulates students' ownership by putting the student in the centre of the decision-making process. Furthermore, the results emphasize the importance of the coach's professional attitude and knowledge about the transition process and the labour market. Practical implications The article concludes with practical implications for novice transition coaches and teachers in higher education. Originality/value The present study adds to the agenda of graduate work readiness by proposing a coaching practice aimed at preparing students for their transition to the labour market.

Monitoring progression of clinical reasoning skills during health sciences education using the case method - a qualitative observational study	BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Clinical problem-solving; Professional development; Health sciences education; Qualitative content analysis	COMPETENCE-BASED EDUCATION; PERFORMANCE	Background: Outcome-or competency-based education is well established in medical and health sciences education. Curricula are based on courses where students develop their competences and assessment is also usually course-based. Clinical reasoning is an important competence, and the aim of this study was to monitor and describe students' progression in professional clinical reasoning skills during health sciences education using observations of group discussions following the case method. Methods: In this qualitative study students from three different health education programmes were observed while discussing clinical cases in a modified Harvard case method session. A rubric with four dimensions - problem-solving process, disciplinary knowledge, character of discussion and communication was used as an observational tool to identify clinical reasoning. A deductive content analysis was performed. Results: The results revealed the students' transition over time from reasoning based strictly on theoretical knowledge to reasoning ability characterized by clinical considerations and experiences. Students who were approaching the end of their education immediately identified the most important problem and then focused on this in their discussion. Practice knowledge increased over time, which was seen as progression in the use of professional language, concepts, terms and the use of prior clinical experience. The character of the discussion evolved from theoretical considerations early in the education to clinical reasoning in later years. Communication within the groups was supportive and conducted with a professional tone. Conclusions: Our observations revealed progression in several aspects of students' clinical reasoning skills on a group level in their discussions of clinical cases.

Yet, according to Whitehead, the ultimate goal of education should be to teach students to learn to apply knowledge. Furthermore, one is confronted with the problem that discipline-specific knowledge and skills are insufficient to respond adequately in a situation with discipline-transcending, new and unknown problems. Next to discipline-specific knowledge and skills, more general knowledge and skills are needed in the area of e.g., communication, problem-solving, use of information, analysis, decision-making. General knowledge and skills, however, offer no guarantee whatsoever that somebody also has sufficient discipline-specific expertise at his disposal. These am die problems that Nijenrode University wants to solve with a new curriculum for management education. In the curriculum developed by Nijenrode, students learn to apply heuristics in the area of general skills and meta-skills (reflecting and learning-to-learn) in interaction with a varying discipline-specific learning content. In this context, discipline-specific knowledge and skills on the one hand, and general skills and meta-skills on the other hand are, in relation to each other, both the objective as well as the means. The student learns the one thing with the help of the other and vice versa, by means of a continuing process of contextualization and decontextualization. The curriculum is a response to the challenge confronting management education to prepare students for future management positions in a world which is characterized by continuous change. The response may be interesting for other types of vocational and professional education as well.

Judging residents' performance: a qualitative study using grounded theory	BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Assessment; Postgraduate medical education; Program directors; resident's performance; Grounded theory	IN-TRAINING ASSESSMENT; POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL-EDUCATION; COMPETENCE-BASED EDUCATION; PROGRAMMATIC ASSESSMENT; FEEDBACK; PERSPECTIVES; EXPLORATION; PORTFOLIOS; CHALLENGES; IMPROVE	BackgroundAlthough program directors judge residents' performance for summative decisions, little is known about how they do this. This study examined what information program directors use and how they value this information in making a judgment of residents' performance and what residents think of this process.MethodsSixteen semi-structured interviews were held with residents and program directors from different hospitals in the Netherlands in 2015-2016. Participants were recruited from internal medicine, surgery and radiology. Transcripts were analysed using grounded theory methodology. Concepts and themes were identified by iterative constant comparison.ResultsWhen approaching semi-annual meetings with residents, program directors report primarily gathering information from the following: assessment tools, faculty members and from their own experience with residents. They put more value on faculty's comments during meetings and in the corridors than on feedback provided in the assessment tools. They are influenced by their own beliefs about learning and education in valuing feedback. Residents are aware that faculty members discuss their performance in meetings, but they believe the assessment tools provide the most important proof to demonstrate their clinical competency.ConclusionsResidents think that feedback in the assessment tools is the most important proof to demonstrate their performance, whereas program directors scarcely use this feedback to form a judgment about residents' performance. They rely heavily on remarks of faculty in meetings instead. Therefore, residents' performance may be better judged in group meetings that are organised to enhance optimal information sharing and decision making about residents' performance.

Residents constitute an important workforce at many hospitals. Yet, the effect of training on residents' contribution to production in patient care is scarcely studied. This study evaluated the effects of early competency-based procedural training on residents' contribution to patient care in central venous catheterization and spinal and epidural anesthesia. Methods: The design was a non-randomized cohort study of first-year anesthesiology residents. The intervention group received additional early focused skills training while three control groups received traditional competency-based education. The residents' contributions to patient care were compared between the intervention group (n = 20), a historical control group (n = 19), and between a contemporary control group (n = 7) and a historical control group (n = 7) from different departments. The residents' vs specialists' procedural production share was compared between years within each study group. We calculated specialist time saved compared to the time spent providing additional skills training in the intervention group. Results: We found statistically significant increases in residents' vs specialists' share of total production after the intervention for epidural anesthesia: 2015: 0.51 (0.23, 0.70) to 2017: 0.94 (0.78, 1.05), p = 0.011 and central venous catheterization: 2015: 0.30 (0.23, 0.36) to 2016: 0.46 (0.35, 0.55), p = .008; and to 2017: 0.64 (0.50, 0.79), p = 0.008. Comparison between residents and specialists on production of the three procedures before and after the intervention showed a surplus of 21 h of freed specialist time per year. Conclusions: Early procedural training results in more productive residents and freed specialist time for additional supervision, other clinical tasks or research. This provides empirical support for a positive correlation between early focused training and increased independent production among residents.

This study analyzes the influence of receiving feedback by teaching associates in the context of achieving and maintaining a level of expertise in complex head and skull examination. Methods: All third year students at a German university who completed the obligatory surgical skills lab training and surgical clerkship participated in this study. The students were randomized into two groups. Control group: lessons by an instructor and peer-based practical skills training. Intervention group: training by teaching associates who are examined as simulation patients and provided direct feedback on student performance. Their competency in short-and long-term competence (directly after intervention and at 4 months after the training) of head and skull examination was measured. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics version 19 (IBM, Armonk, USA). Parametric and non-parametric test methods were applied. As a measurement of correlation, Pearson correlations and correlations via Kendall's-Tau-b were calculated and Cohen's d effect size was calculated. Results: A total of 181 students were included (90 intervention, 91 control). Out of those 181 students 81 agreed to be videotaped (32 in the control group and 49 in the TA group) and examined at time point 1. At both time points, the intervention group performed the examination significantly better (time point 1, p = <.001; time point 2 (rater 1 p = .009, rater 2 p = .015), than the control group. The effect size (Cohens d) was up to 1.422. Conclusions: The use of teaching associates for teaching complex practical skills is effective for short-and long-term retention. We anticipate the method could be easily translated to nearly every patient-based clinical skill, particularly with regards to a competence-based education of future doctors.

The impact of COVID-19 on ophthalmology resident surgical experience: a retrospective cross-sectional analysis	BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Graduate medical education; Clinical competence; Ophthalmologic surgical procedures; COVID-19	COMPETENCE-BASED EDUCATION	Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused significant disruption to in-office and surgical procedures in the field of ophthalmology. The magnitude of the impact of the pandemic on surgical training among ophthalmology residents is not known. This study aims to quantify changes in average case logs among United States (U.S.) ophthalmology residency graduates prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of aggregate, national data on case logs of U.S. ophthalmology residency graduates from 2012 to 2020. The yearly percent change in the average number of procedures performed in the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) ophthalmology resident case logs were analyzed using linear regression on log-transformed dependent variables. The average percent change from 2019 to 2020 was compared to the average yearly percent change from 2012 to 2019 for procedures performed as the primary surgeon, and primary surgeon and surgical assistant (S + A), as well as procedures for which there are ACGME minimum graduating numbers. Results Across all procedures and roles, average case logs in 2020 were lower than the averages in 2019. While average total cases logged as primary surgeon increased yearly by 3.2% (95% CI: 2.7, 3.8%, p < 0.001) from 2012 to 2019, total primary surgeon case logs decreased by 11.2% from 2019 to 2020. Cataract (-22.0%) and keratorefractive (-21.1%) surgery experienced the greatest percent decrease in average primary surgeon cases logged from 2019 to 2020. Average total cases logged as S + A experienced an average yearly increase by 1.2% (95% CI: 0.9,1.6%, p < 0.001) prior to 2020, but decreased by 9.6% from 2019 to 2020. For ACGME minimum requirements, similar changes were observed. Specifically, the average case logs in YAG, SLT, filtering (glaucoma), and intravitreal injections had been increasing significantly prior to 2020 (p < 0.05 for all) but decreased in 2020. Conclusions These findings demonstrate the vulnerability of ophthalmology residency programs to a significant interruption in surgical volume. There is a critical need for development of competency-based, rather than volume-based, requirements to evaluate readiness for independent practice.

J	Struyven, K; De Meyst, M				Struyven, Katrien; De Meyst, Marijke			Competence-based teacher education: Illusion or reality? An assessment of the implementation status in Flanders from teachers' and students' points of view	TEACHING AND TEACHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Competence(s); Teacher training; Perceptions; Innovations; Imposed change; Elementary; School teacher education; Competency-based teacher education (CBTE); Pre-service teacher training; Educational change	LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS; PORTFOLIOS	Since 1998, the Flanders' educational government in Belgium has been urging teacher education institutions by decree to implement competences in teacher training programs. Since then, years have gone by, and institutions have acted in order to achieve the competence-based goals. However, have they succeeded in implementing them? This is the research question that is central to the current study. An online survey inquiry was set up in eight elementary teacher education institutions using two questionnaires; one for final year elementary institution pre-service teachers, who were about to graduate at the time of completing the questionnaire (N = 218), the other for teacher trainers throughout the elementary teacher training program (N = 51). Ten years after the decree was issued, results show that competence-based education has become a reality in terms of its implementation. However, the process has not yet come to an end. Whereas some competences are clearly present in the institutions' policies and practices (e.g. teacher as guide to learning and development, teacher as subject expert), others are poorly represented (e.g. teacher as partner of parents, external parties and as a member of the educational community). Moreover, teacher trainers tend to take four different approaches to the implementation of competences (1) during internship, (2) through the institution's policy and program planning, (3) by means of their integration in both theoretical and practical components of the curriculum and finally, (4) a lack of implementation because the competences are considered insufficiently applicable by the teacher trainers. In particular, more experienced and subject expert teacher trainers tend to adopt the final approach more often than do younger colleagues and pedagogues. Student teachers' results, on the other hand, suggest important differences between institutions concerning their understanding of competences and the integration of these competences in the curriculum; suggesting different paces of adaptation between teacher education institutions. Moreover, even within schools, the trajectory towards implementation is not always clear for all members of the teaching team, nor for the students of most teacher education institutions. Consequently, there is still important work to be done in order for successful competence-based change to occur. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A quantitative study of forms, perceptions of impact and related individual and organisational factors	EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING			English	Article						Vocational education and training; Teacher collaboration; Collegiality; Teacher professional development and learning; Teacher survey		Background This study investigates teacher collaboration in Hungarian vocational education and training (VET) schools based on an online survey of teachers (n = 303). Collaboration of teachers has long been appreciated for its significant benefits including increased motivation, job satisfaction, self- and collective efficacy, as well as its role in teacher professional development and school improvement. Collaboration of teachers working in VET schools, especially in VET systems where initial VET is provided to young people and (in part) within compulsory education, appears as particularly desirable, given the special context, objectives and challenges of this sector and the spread of competence-based education. However, relatively little is known about VET teacher collaboration, especially in Hungary, where three different profiles of teachers-general subject and vocational teachers and vocational trainers-work in VET schools. The aim of our study was to provide data about how Hungarian VET teachers collaborate, which could validate prior research results on teacher collaboration as well as identify any special features of the VET context. Method Our study design was exploratory, descriptive and correlational, applying quantitative statistical analysis. We measured teacher collaboration (practice and perception of impact) and explanatory individual and organisational factors selected for our research framework by adapting instruments of previous empirical studies (most importantly, OECD's TALIS). We analysed connections between collaboration and independent variables created by principal component analysis. Results Our data show that sharing-type collaboration (professional discussions and exchange of materials) are widespread among Hungarian VET teachers. They are much less likely to participate in deeper collaborative activities that presuppose higher levels of interdependence, and they also appreciate the impact of deeper collaboration less. Female respondents participate in sharing-type activities more than their male colleagues, and middle-aged (40-55) are most active in both types of collaboration and perceive the most impact. Collaboration practices correlate most with perceptions of their impact. More frequent collaboration and perceptions of higher impact are related to teachers' sense of higher self-efficacy and relaxed, tolerant and encouraging collegial relationships. Structural barriers seem to influence only sharing and perceptions of impact. Small, but statistically significant differences in collaboration were found between the three teacher profiles. Vocational trainers (who instruct vocational school practice) showed the highest level of participation in deeper collaboration, while vocational teachers were least likely to participate and perceived the least impact. No significant associations were found between collaboration and prior or current work experience in the taught vocation. Conclusions Our results largely confirm and validate previous research on teacher collaboration in lower level and general educational contexts by providing data on VET teacher collaboration. They also note the role of some VET-specific factors, such as structural barriers and small, but statistically significant differences between different VET teacher profiles.
