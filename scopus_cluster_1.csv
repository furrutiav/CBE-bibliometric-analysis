It is essential to consider students’ understanding of sustainability at the end of their studies to assess whether they feel prepared to apply sustainability in their daily work life. Design/methodology/approach: The study has a quantitative case study design, and the specific method used is an online survey with masters’ students using the university student platform EvaSys. The study assesses approaching how students perceive the overall education integrating sustainability into programs and curricula. Findings: The results showed that work-integrated learning (WIL) projects learning and real-life experiences as part of their studies enhanced the students’ understanding of sustainability. Moreover, the study showed that integrating an understanding of the SDGs in teaching offers universities a way to frame students’ key competencies in ways that allow them to develop their interpersonal competencies as ambassadors for sustainability in their future work life. Practical implications: This study supports the argument that WIL and real-life university experiences enhance students’ key competencies critical for sustainability. Originality/value: The pedagogical approach advanced in this paper addresses how WIL and real-life experiences might develop students’ key competencies on sustainability. This approach indicates that working with SDGs in teaching encourages students to promote their interpersonal competencies for sustainability. © 2021, Karin Alm, Thomas H.

According to their research, HEIs play a vital role in transforming SD in society and stress that the main barriers to implementing sustainability in HEIs’ systems are a lack of continuity of actions and resistance to changes (). HEIs’ systems should have all the resources needed to develop innovative sustainable solutions: science, technology, highly educated researchers, teaching staff and motivated students (). claim that universities always must take the role of significant contributors addressing SD and implementing SDGs in HEIs. In this way, integrating SD in HEIs goes beyond developing course curricula, educating new generations of leaders for future change and practices of SD in teaching to grasp behavioral change. A basic example of this opportunity can be found in the sustainable waste-water treatment education proposals explored in . Their study focuses on how innovative HEIs’ programming may serve achievement targets of SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation. Another example, emphasize HEIs’ sustainability and addresses the associated complex problems. Their study at Arizona State University (ASU) argued that real-world learning opportunities could be used to help develop a problem-solving mindset. This effort by universities to develop innovative ways to grow students’ capabilities for SD has also resulted in university-to-university collaborations. For example, the AGERA project () was funded by the Swedish Government agency Vinnova which administers state funding for research and development. The effort is a collaboration of seven universities across Sweden to create a framework for integration and alignment of the Agenda 2030 SDGs in university operations and programming.",,,,,,,,,,"(2020) Agenda 2030 och de globala målen sätter ramarna för samverkan i vinnova-projektet AGERA, , https://gmv.chalmers.gu.se/samverkan/agera, (accessed: 10 November 2020; Amos, H.W., Chinatown by numbers: Defining an ethnic space by empirical linguistic landscape (2016) LinguisticLandscape, 2 (2), pp. 127-156; Ávila, L.V., Beuron, T.A., Brandli, L.L., Damke, L.I., Pereire, R.S., Klein, L.L., Barriers to innovation and sustainability in universities: an international comparison (2019) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 20 (5), pp. 805-821; Bokhari, A.A., Universities“ social responsibility (USR) and sustainable development: a conceptual framework (2017) International Journal of Economics and Management Studies, 4 (12), pp. 8-16; Boyon, N., Awareness of united nations sustainable development goals is highest in emerging countries (2019) Ipsos, , www.ipsos.com/en/awareness-united-nations-sustainable-development-goals-highest-emerging-countries; Brundiers, K., Barth, M., Cebrián, G., Cohen, M., Diaz, L., Doucette-Remington, S., Zint, M., Key competencies in sustainability in higher education—toward an agreed-upon reference framework (2020) Sustainability Science, 16 (1), pp. 13-29; Brundiers, K., Wiek, A., Educating students in real-world sustainability research: vision and implementation (2010) Innovative Higher Education, 36 (2), pp. 107-124; Brundiers, K., Wiek, A., Redman, C.L., Real-world learning opportunities in sustainability: from classroom into the real world (2010) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 11 (4), pp. 308-324; Caniglia, G., John, B.L., Lang, D.J., Wiek, A., Cohmer, S., Laubichler, M.D., The glocal curriculum: a model for transnational collaboration in higher education for sustainable development (2018) Journal of Cleaner Production, 171 (2018), pp. 368-376; Crowe, S., Cresswell, K., Robertson, A., Huby, G., Avery, A., Sheikh, A., The case study approach (2011) BMC Medical Research Methodology, 11 (1), p. 100; Expósito, L.C., Sánchez, J.G., Implementation of SDGs in university teaching: a course for professional development of teachers in education for sustainability for a transformative action (2020) Sustainability, 12 (19), p. 8267; Filho, L.W., Tripathi, S.K., Andrade-Guerra, J.B.S.O.D., Gine-Garriga, R., Orlovic Lovren, V., Willats, J., Using the sustainable development goals towards a better understanding of sustainability challenges (2019) International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, 26 (2), pp. 179-190; (2020) Art. 1 GDPR, , https://gdpr-info.eu/art-1-gdpr/, (accessed: 17 April 2020; (2020) Higher education in the world 7, , www.guninetwork.org/report/higher-education-world-7; (2020), https://gmv.gu.se/samverkan/agera; Johnson, B., Christensen, L., (2008) Educational Research: Quantitative, Qualitative, and Mixed Approaches, , 3rd ed., SAGE, London, GB; Jorge, M.L., Pena, J., Analysing the literature on university social responsibility: a review of selected higher education journals (2017) Higher Education Quarterly, 71 (4), pp. 302-319; Junghanns, J., Beery, T., Ecological sanitation and sustainable nutrient recovery education: considering the three fixes for environmental problem-solving (2020) Sustainability, 12 (9), p. 3587; Lo, C.W., Pang, R.X., Egri, C.P., Li, P.H., University social responsibility: Conceptualization and an assessment framework (2017) Quality of Life in Asia University Social Responsibility and Quality of Life, pp. 37-59; Lozano, R., Lukman, R., Lozano, F.J., Huisingh, D., Lambrechts, W., Declarations for sustainability in higher education: becoming better leaders, through addressing the university system (2011) Journal of Cleaner Production, 48, pp. 10-19; Lozano, R., Merrill, M., Sammalisto, K., Ceulemans, K., Lozano, F., Connecting competences and pedagogical approaches for sustainable development in higher education: a literature review and framework proposal (2017) Sustainability, 9 (10), p. 1889; Mazur, B., Walczyna, A., Bojar, M., Structure of competences of Lublin university of technology students in the field of sustainable development (2021) European Research Studies Journal, 24 (2), pp. 394-404; Pálsdóttir, A., Jóhannsdóttir, L., Key competencies for sustainability in university of Iceland curriculum (2021) Sustainability, 13 (16), p. 8945; Park, K., Park, N., Heo, W., Gustafson, K., What prompts college students to participate in online surveys?

This review: (1) briefly outlines the development of competence-based models; (2) presents difficulties when defining and delineating differences between competences, skills, and abilities; (3) presents the main challenges of competence measurement; (4) presents recent findings of competence-based models in organizational and individual context; and (5) highlights challenges these models are likely to encounter in the future. To this end, a non-systematic literature review was carried out to summarize relevant published research studies and to define future research directions. Results show that further competence-based research should focus on generalizing the findings by looking at various groups of workers and industries, expanding the set of competences used in the analyses, using different definitions of key competences, and developing alternative models to assess their impact on performance. Such research would allow to better assess employees’ preparedness in terms of competence requirements, as well as to identify the most critical gaps and opportunities for the formal educational system and as part of on-the-job training. © 2022, The Author(s).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adamchik, V.A., Hyclak, T.J., Sedlak, P., Taylor, L.W., Wage returns to english proficiency in Poland (2019) J Labor Res, 40, pp. 276-295; Ahn, Y.H., Annie, R.P., Kwon, H., Key competencies for US construction graduates: Industry perspective (2012) J Prof Iss Eng Educ Pract, 138 (2), pp. 123-130; Allegrante, J.P., Moon, R.W., Auld, M.E., Gebbie, K.M., Continuing-education needs of the currently employed public health education workforce (2001) Am J Public Health, 91 (8), pp. 1230-1234. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD3MvlsVWiuw%3D%3D, PID: 11499109; Allen, J., Van der Velden, R.K.W., Educational mismatches versus skill mismatches: effects on wages, job satisfaction, on‐the‐job search (2001) Oxford Econ Paper, 53 (3), pp. 434-452; Allen, J., Arnesen, C.A., Calmand, J., Frontini, M., Paul, J.J., Rostan, M., Schomburg, H., Van der Velden, R.K.W., (2007) The flexible professional in the knowledge society: general results of the REFLEX project, , Research Centre for Education and the Labour Market.

Project-based learning has become a widely recommended pedagogy for sustainability education. It is hypothesized that through collaboration, student autonomy and real-world application, students develop key competencies for sustainability. This paper also aims to examine the connection between project-based learning and competence development on a program level from the student perspective. Design/methodology/approach: This two-year comparative case study follows the project-based-learning journeys of nine graduate sustainability students from three programs: the Master’s of Sustainability at Arizona State University, the Master’s of Sustainability Science at Leuphana University of Lüneburg and the Global Sustainability Science Master’s, an ASU and Leuphana collaboration. Over four semesters, the students each took part in four competence-oriented self-assessments and interviews to map their perceived learning throughout their programs. Additional contextual information was gathered from program and course materials and descriptions, instructor interviews and in vivo observations. Findings: The defining aspects of project-based learning including collaboration, student autonomy and real-world connection do contribute to students’ self-perceived competence development. Student-driven and program-driven project-based learning experiences equally foster this result, as long as the pedagogical challenges of balancing support and student independence associated with each are mitigated through instructor actions, program design or individual student coping skills. Originality/value: The results of this research can support higher education institutions in designing sustainability programs aimed at competence development through project-based learning. The focus on the curricular and program level combined with repeated overtime student-reported attribution to specific courses and activities bridges the gap between individual course case studies and theoretical recommendations for curriculum design. In addition to length and depth, this study also forefronts student experience of curricula as delivered. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Curriculum; Education for sustainable development; Higher learning; Key competencies in sustainability; Project-based learning,,,,,,"A115235; Leuphana Universität Lüneburg, LUL","The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the Lower Saxony Ministry of Science and Culture & Volkswagen Foundation for the grant “Educating Future Change Agents – Higher Education as a Motor of the Sustainability Transformation” (A115235) through the program “Science for Sustainable Development.” The authors would also like to thank their colleagues Matthias Barth, Jan-Ole Brandt, Jantje Halberstadt, Theres Konrad, Aaron Redman, Jana Timm, and Marie Weiss from Leuphana University of Lüneburg, Germany for support on the research design presented in this article, as well as for comments on the manuscript.

Over a period of two years, we collected empirical data on competencies of senior sustainability professionals by using an action research approach. Data collection took place in Belgium Flanders via an elaborate iterative action-reflection process including an interactive workshop, interviews, and an online survey. Our analysis provides strong empirical evidence for the existence of two complemen-tary competency clusters, namely sustainability research competencies and sustainability intervention competencies. Together they enable the profound analysis and understanding of sustainability issues and ensure the ability to devise solutions and foster change towards sustainability. Furthermore, we shed a first light on the interaction of these competency clusters and their link with the practitioners’ topical knowledge and lived experience. This study bridges the divergence in literature between theoretically and empirically driven research and offers novel insights on sustainability competencies for the fields of sustainability science, human resource management, and higher education. © 2022 by the authors.

Taking a competence-based approach, the proposed coaching practice aims to enhance students' employability competences to facilitate a smoother school-to-work transition. However, what transition coaching looks like remains largely unclear. Moreover, in competence-based education, teachers are expected to be highly skilled coaches, facilitating students' transition to the labour market. The present study aims to map the core competencies of a transition coach. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative design was adopted to map the core competences of a transition coach. Data were collected from two focus groups, consisting of coaches in higher education and in the workplace. Findings: Results show that, to create the necessary support conditions, a coach creates a safe coaching environment and supports students in setting goals, guide them in the activities they undertake to attain these goals, and asks reflective questions. Moreover, the coach stimulates students' ownership by putting the student in the centre of the decision-making process. Furthermore, the results emphasize the importance of the coach's professional attitude and knowledge about the transition process and the labour market. Practical implications: The article concludes with practical implications for novice transition coaches and teachers in higher education. Originality/value: The present study adds to the agenda of graduate work readiness by proposing a coaching practice aimed at preparing students for their transition to the labour market. © 2022, Niels van der Baan, Inken Gast, Wim Gijselaers and Simon Beausaert.",Coaching; Employability competences; Higher education; School-to-work transition; Work readiness; Workplace,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baartman, L.K.J., Bastiaens, T.J., Kirschner, P.A., van der Vleuten, C.P.M., Evaluating assessment quality in competence-based education: a qualitative comparison of two frameworks (2007) Educational Research Review, 2 (2), pp. 114-129; Baert, S., Cockx, B., Verhaest, D., Overeducation at the start of the career: stepping stone or trap?

However, the literature does not reveal what such preparedness looks like – how much preparation is enough and, conversely, how low levels of preparation can be easily recognised by emergency agencies. This study maps Australian emergency agency understanding of competencies that are needed by individuals and communities for effective preparation. Using in-depth semi-structured interviews of 30 emergency agency, local council and not-for-profit organisation staff from all Australian states, participants identified a range of community and individual features that they had seen in un-prepared and well-prepared communities and which they believed were key competencies for protective action. These competencies were then mapped against participants’ perceptions of five different levels of preparation, resulting in a Preparedness Competency Index that allows agencies to benchmark preparation in communities, as well as to recognise when lack of preparation competency leaves groups vulnerable. © 2022",Community; Competency; Natural hazards; Preparedness; Protective action,,,,,,,"We would like to thank the Australian Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC and the seven Australian emergency agencies and local councils who funded this project: NSW State Emergency Service , Inspector-General of Emergency Management Qld , Department of Fire and Emergency Services (WA) , Queensland Fire and Emergency Serivces , Cairns Regional Council , Ipswich City Council and Tablelands Regional Council.",,,,,,,,,,"Human cost of disasters: overview of the last 20 years 2000 – 2019 (2020), https://www.undrr.org/publication/human-cost-disasters-overview-last-20-years-2000-2019, Retrieved from: Geneva, Switzerland; Report (2020), https://naturaldisaster.royalcommission.gov.au/publications/royal-commission-national-natural-disaster-arrangements-report, Retrieved from, Canberra, Australia; Godschalk, D.R., Rose, A., Mittler, E., Porter, K., West, C.T., Estimating the value of foresight: aggregate analysis of natural hazard mitigation benefits and costs (2009) J.

In the face of environmental and social challenges, these are key competencies that require significant changes in university curricula, supporting a sustainable and innovative economy. This article aims to present the results of a study on young people’s awareness of sustainable development and their opinion on the implementation of SDGs in curricula. The publication responds to the demand of technical students for educational content related to sustainable development and a greater integration of economic, social, and environmental issues. The analysis carried out as part of the EnAct-SDGs project at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow (Poland) shows that students are increasingly aware of the importance of sustainable development in various aspects of their lives, both in their education, in their professional work and in their lives, as part of an awareness-raising society. The conducted analyses allowed us to define the directions of necessary changes in the didactic process as an essential set of skills and knowledge for future graduates of raw materials faculties. © 2022 by the authors.

The main idea of this research is to assess the level of students’ competences for lifelong learning (LLL). Since it is a very complex task, it is characterized by a lack of information and the vagueness of the inherently subjective nature of human thinking. The uncertain values of the assessed level of students’ competences for LLL are represented by linguistic expressions which are modeled by the interval type 2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Ranking of the level of students’ competences for LLL is stated as a fuzzy multi-criteria optimization task. The aggregation of students’ opinions into unique marks is given by using the proposed fuzzy Delphi technique. The rank of students’ competences for LLL is given by using the proposed fuzzy Simple Additive Weighting (FSAW). The order of measures that should be delivered to improve students’ competences is based on the obtained rank. The model is tested and discussed on the real data collected from a significant sample of the students with a proposal of future directions of the research. © 2022 by the authors.

We propose an innovative theoretical framework that links such KSAs to the UNESCO’s Key Competences for Sustainability and specific SDGs. Moreover, we analysed which KSAs are addressed by institutional initiatives to support mobility students, exposing their contribution to the SDGs. Finally, we revised mobile students’ needs of institutional support on KSA’s acquisition through focus groups. Results show that the KSAs most addressed by the institutional initiatives are related to several SDGs, but mainly to SDG4 (Quality Education) and SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). Notwithstanding, additional institutional support may be needed for students to leverage their learning outcomes and transform international mobility into a key driver of the necessary social change towards the achievement of SDGs. © 2022 by the authors.

Accordingly, its epistemology and teaching contents influence other disciplines, the conception of society and the political agenda. From this perspective, it is strategic that the teaching of economics promotes sustainable development. The aim of this article is to examine what the subjects of economics and business economics teach about sustainability at the upper secondary education level in Spain, and if they contribute to the acquisition of the key competencies of the education for sustainable development. A content analysis is carried out of both the curriculum and the textbooks to that end. Our results emphasise that the ideas, concepts and values transmitted by the Spanish upper secondary economics textbooks do not adequately promote knowledge about sustainability or the learning of the key competencies. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",action competence; economics education; education for sustainable development; ethics; Sustainability; textbooks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Akenji, L., Briggs, E., (2015) Sustainable consumption and production: A handbook for policymakers, , United Nations Environment Programme.,.

This paper puts previously proposed SE key competencies in dialogue with theories of practice, identifying how curricular and practicum practices are performed through an examination of public-facing program documentation, which includes websites, social media, and curricula. Results show that social capitals are manifest in SE practices that work both internally and externally to define the SE field and foster meaningful SE education. Four patterns of practice are crucial to creating accessibility and engaging multiple stakeholders: institutional practices which instill an active and outward-facing institutional presence, practices of a student-centered organization that bridge and link entrepreneurs, valuation practices incorporating sustainability, and persistent external engagements. These findings provide a roadmap to guide management programs in creating knowledgeable and effective social entrepreneurs, and suggest that this multi-pronged approach to creating SE pathways of practice addresses the complex and pluralistic problems that lie at the core of social innovation projects. © 2022 The Author",Education for sustainable development; Key competencies; Social capital; Social entrepreneurship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adomßent, M., Fischer, D., Godemann, J., Herzig, C., Otte, I., Rieckmann, M., Emerging areas in research on higher education for sustainable development–management education, sustainable consumption and perspectives from Central and Eastern Europe (2014) Journal of Cleaner Production, 62, pp. 1-7; André, K., Pache, A., From caring entrepreneur to caring enterprise: Addressing the ethical challenges of scaling up social enterprises (2016) Journal of Business Ethics, 133 (4), pp. 659-675. , http://www.jstor.org/stable/24703745, Retrieved December 18, 2020, from; Bacq, S., Hartog, C., Hoogendoorn, B., Beyond the moral portrayal of social entrepreneurs: An empirical approach to who they are and what drives them (2016) Journal of Business Ethics, 133 (4), pp. 703-718. , http://www.jstor.org/stable/24703748, Retrieved December 18, 2020, from; Barth, M., Godemann, J., Rieckman, M., Stoltenberg, U., Developing key competences for sustainable development in higher education (2007) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 8, pp. 416-430; Bengtsson, M., How to plan and perform a qualitative study using content analysis (2016) NursingPlus Open, 2, pp. 8-14; Biberhofer, P., Lintner, C., Bernhardt, J., Rieckmann, M., Facilitating work performance of sustainability-driven entrepreneurs through higher education: The relevance of competencies, values, worldviews and opportunities (2019) The International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Innovation, 20 (1), pp. 21-38; Blok, V., Gremmen, B., Wesselink, R., Dealing with the wicked problem of sustainable development: The necessity virtuous competence (2015) Business and Professional Ethics Journal, 34, pp. 297-327; Bourdieu, P., Outline of a theory of practice (1972), Translated by Richard Nice.

As a sustainability science field, nexus research should in theory bring together transdisciplinary approaches drawing from a range of stakeholder knowledge and experiences. This approach would align with the competence-based training for future sustainability leaders advocated for in sustainability education literature. In practice, the field is dominated by techno-scientific approaches with superficial or peripheral attention paid to issues of social justice and community engagement. In this article, we explore how this imbalance in the literature reflects a breakdown between the ideals of sustainability training and the reality of training at the nexus and describe obstacles that may be contributing to this breakdown, including a prejudice towards the idea of “objective” science, institutional incentives, and disciplinary culture. To address these concerns, we introduce a research project focused on assessing the training of future researchers at the FEW nexus and exploring how these programs train students in particular views of what is important at the FEW nexus, such as technological solutions, stakeholder collaboration, and/or issues of equity and justice. It will also provide recommendations for creating open learning environments that are competence-based, and that incorporate multiple methods, acknowledgments of limitations, and alternate ways of knowing. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",,,,,,,"1828910; University of Minnesota Duluth, UMD","All authors were supported by NRT-INFEWS: UMD Global STEWARDS (STEM Training at the Nexus of Energy, WAter Reuse and FooD Systems) that was awarded to the University of Maryland School of Public Health by the National Science Foundation National Research Traineeship Program, Grant number 1828910.",,,,,,,,,,"Albrecht, T.R., Crootof, A., Scott, C.A., The water-energy-food nexus: A systematic review of methods for nexus assessment (2018) Environmental Research Letters, 13 (4); Allouche, J., Middleton, C., Gyawali, D., (2014) Nexus Nirvana or Nexus Nullity?

Such sustainability competencies have been articulated with multiplicity and ambiguity, which is counterproductive to joint and accelerated progress. A unified framework of sustainability learning objectives would provide guidance to students, educators, and administrators of sustainability programs. To this end, we carried out a systematic review of the relevant literature. After scanning thousands of publications, we identified over 270 peer-reviewed articles of highest relevance, spanning two decades. Despite appearance otherwise, we found that there is a high level of agreement among scholars over the sustainability competencies that students should be trained in. Expanding on the five key competencies, namely, systems-thinking, anticipatory, normative, strategic, and interpersonal competence, that have gained widespread use, this article synthesizes the new suggestions made over the past decade into a unified framework. It centers on 8 key competencies in sustainability (the 5 established and 3 emerging—intrapersonal, implementation, and integration competence), which are complemented by separate disciplinary, general, and other professional competencies. This comprehensive framework of key competencies in sustainability is applicable across disciplines and can guide faculty, students, and practitioners in their joint efforts to advance transformations towards sustainability.

The results show increased attention during the last decade to develop a set of ESD competencies for teachers, which reveals the absence of a unified framework for teacher competencies for ESD. However, the extent to which these competencies are effectively integrated into teacher education remains an undiscovered area. This paper highlights the progress and gaps in the research related to mainstreaming ESD competencies in teacher education, providing evidence from the literature that can inform policy and strategy improvement in higher education institutions. © 2021 by the authors.

Universities around the world have explicitly taken up the responsibility of developing in students the skills and knowledge (i.e., competencies) necessary to be successful SCAs. While there is clear convergence around planning competencies, intrapersonal and implementation competencies have recently emerged in the literature. These competencies will have to remain effective even in the face of adversity, yet too little is known about sources of motivation for SCAs and how motivation can be maintained despite these inevitable setbacks. Since the needed transformations will be collective processes, motivation to be a SCA needs to be understood in the social and realistic context in which they would be applied. This study sought to gain specific insights into: 1.) What motivates students to be SCAs? 2.) How do these SCAs maintain their motivation in the face of setbacks? 3.) What can higher education institutions (e.g., universities, colleges) do to better support the motivation of SCAs? In order to gain insights into these questions, 83 aspiring SCAs were surveyed and their responses analyzed using qualitative content analysis. For this group of SCAs, the key source of motivation evolved from a focus on nature, learning, and individual behavior to a more social view with a concern for structural change. Moreover, social networks and intrapersonal skills helped to restore students' motivation following setbacks. Despite being university students, the SCAs surveyed had already experienced significant setbacks and, largely without institutional support, learned strategies to overcome them and maintain their motivation. Motivation and the skills, knowledge, and experience of how to maintain the drive for positive change in the face of setbacks is crucial in order for SCAs to be capable of supporting the critically needed transformations, and universities must play their part in fostering the SCAs' capability. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.",key competencies in sustainability; motivation; sustainability change agents; sustainability education; sustainability transformations,competition (economics); knowledge; student; sustainability; university sector,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agyeman, J., Mcentee, J., Moving the field of food justice forward through the lens of urban political ecology (2014) Geography Compass, 8 (3), pp. 211-220. , https://doi.org/10.1111/gec3.12122; Atkisson, A., (2012) The sustainability transformation: How to accelerate positive change in challenging times, , https://doi.org/10.4324/9781849775700, Taylor & Francis; Barlett, P.F., Chase, G.W., (2013) Sustainability in higher education: stories and strategies for transformation, , MIT Press; Bouman, T., Steg, L., Dietz, T., Insights from early COVID-19 responses about promoting sustainable action (2021) Nature Sustainability, 4 (3), pp. 194-200. , https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-020-00626-x; Bowman, R., Rethinking what motivates and inspires students (2011) The Clearing House: A Journal of Educational Strategies, Issues and Ideas, 84 (6), pp. 264-269. , https://doi.org/10.1080/00098655.2011.592164; Brundiers, K., Educating for post-disaster sustainability efforts (2018) International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 27, pp. 406-414. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2017.11.002; Brundiers, K., Barth, M., Cebrian, G., Cohen, M., Diaz, L., Key competencies in sustainability in higher education-toward an agreedupon reference framework (2021) Sustainability Science, 16 (1), pp. 13-29. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-020-00838-2; Conley, S.N., Foley, R.W., Gorman, M.E., Denham, J., Coleman, K., Acquisition of T-shaped expertise: An exploratory study (2017) Social Epistemology, 31 (2), pp. 165-183. , https://doi.org/10.1080/02691728.2016.1249435; Crenshaw, K.W., (2017) On intersectionality: Essential writings, , The New Press; de Haan, G., The development of ESD-related competencies in supportive institutional frameworks (2010) International Review of Education, 56 (2-3), pp. 315-328. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11159-010-9157-9; Goleman, D., Boyatzis, R.E., Emotional intelligence has 12 Elements.

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how a program evaluation can be approached through a participatory approach, and what this means for learning competencies for sustainability. The innovative method chosen was to implement a student-led evaluation of the program or a form of practice-based learning whereby students engaged in a participatory evaluation of their own program. This evaluation involved a mixed-methods research design and engaging with different actors—from other students and teachers in the program to alumni, administrators and employers. Students agreed on what competencies to evaluate against, then designed their assessment to gauge how and in what way five key competencies were being delivered. The program delivers competencies for sustainable development, yet there was some discrepancy between what students experienced in the program and what teachers believed to be delivering in the classroom. The learning-by-doing approach suggests that a sixth competency—implementation skills—is relevant to teaching for sustainable development. A participatory, student-led approach to evaluating a Master program is a novel contribution to the literature, which in itself led to the development of competencies for sustainability, particularly strategic, interpersonal and implementation skills. © 2021 by the authors.

Most project-based courses take an instrumental approach to these interactions, so that they support the overall project deliverables. However, as courses primarily intend to build students’ key competencies in sustainability, including the competence to collaborate in teams and with stakeholders, there are opportunities to utilize these interactions more directly to build students’ interpersonal competence. This study offers insights from project-based sustainability courses at universities in Germany, the U.S., Switzerland, and Spain to empirically explore such opportunities. We investigate how students develop interpersonal competence by learning from (rather than through) their interactions with peers, instructors, stakeholders, and mentors. The findings can be used by course instructors, curriculum designers, and program administrators to more deliberately use the interactions with peers, instructors, stakeholders, and mentors in project-based sustainability courses for developing students’ competence to successfully collaborate in teams and with stakeholders. © 2021 by the authors.

This means that not only the teamwork setting allows for interpersonal competence development, but the exchange among peers about their group work, too. Such exchanges took place in all three courses. The GSR and tdCS course had several groups working on one umbrella project, while the ARW course had different individual student projects. Students went through the same cycles of planning, acting, and reflecting, which constituted shared experiences and the basis for reflection and exchange.","This research was funded by Volkswagen Foundation and Nieders?chsische Ministerium f?r Wissenschaft und Kultur, grant number A115235.",,,,,,,,,"Raworth, K., A Safe and Just Space for Humanity: Can we live within the doughnut?

The United Nations presented eight Sustainability Key Competencies (SKCs) that represent cross-cutting competencies crucial to advance sustainable development and achieve Sustainable Development Goals. The aim of this research is to know to what extent the University of Iceland courses seem to include the emphasis of the SKCs, either in the course description text or the learning outcomes. Data collection took place in early 2020 and included analysing every single university’s course description text and learning outcomes using a curriculum analysis key for SKCs. Results show that proportionally, most signs of SKCs were found for SKC 3 (Normative competency) in 53% of courses in the university, and SKC 6 (Critical thinking competency) in 46% of the university’s courses. For individual schools of the university, the far highest proportion of signs of SKC was found for the School of Education (5.0 signs per course) and the relatively fewest for the School of Humanities (1.1 sign per course). The results are discussed both in relation to identified competencies needed for the pressing sustainability problems humanity faces, and in the light of a discrepancy appearing between the university’s ranking according to Times Higher Education University Ranking by cita-tions, research, and teaching, and the proportional signs of individual SKCs within the University of Iceland. © 2021 by the authors.

This study stresses the need to work towards achieving quality education, and to prepare future teachers in sustainability competencies. The research questions are related to the key competencies necessary to accelerate change and to how to increase awareness and literacy of the SDGs in higher education. A quantitative methodology aimed at improving the training of future teachers who engage in reflective and critical thinking was used. Data were gathered on the level of reflection of students from three Spanish universities. The instrument used, the Reflective Practice Questionnaire, includes concepts defined in the literature related to reflective capacity such as Reflection in Action, Reflection on Action and Reflection with Others. The results of the study provide quantitative data showing a positive impact of reflective practice on future teachers. Education for sustainable development requires participatory methods that motivate and empower students to change their behaviour. Reflective practice must be accompanied by processes of communication and supervision that encourage confidence and the desire to improve. Training future teachers in reflective practice should be a differentiating element to achieve quality education, allowing adaptation to current and future adverse situations. © 2021 by the authors.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the professionalism of thirteen doctoral dance programs in Korea. The study included thirteen doctoral programs from 10 universities in Korea. Data on the dance programs were collected using school bulletins, websites, and booklets. Educational goals, doctoral program requirements, and syllabi were analyzed based on the documents of each graduate school. Although most graduate school dance programs offered similar characteristics of courses, programs majorly comprised theory, performance, and workshops. Dance performance appeared to be an important aspect of dance programs in Korea. Interestingly, three different genres of dance (Korean folk dance, modern dance, and ballet) were overwhelmingly present in doctoral programs. This study recommended that more research-and scholastic-oriented programs should be provided in doctoral programs to enhance the fundamentals of the dance academic environment. Overall, more specialized programs are required to meet the various needs and choices of the doctoral students. It is certain that students’ interests and academic excellence are the greatest assets for doctoral dance major students. The concepts of diversity, culture, and interdisciplinary cooperation should be applied more to the description and research of graduate courses. Operationalizing these efforts through rigorous assessments of students’ mastery of key competencies in the curriculum is another evolving task for sustainable education leaders. © 2021 by the author.

The objective of this research was to identify and analyze the relationships between the values taught in schools and mobile addiction. The study design was predictive correlational. The sample consisted of 1453 students of primary and secondary education (61.3% women; 38.7% men). The findings have shown a significant correlation between the values taught in schools and mobile phone addiction. It is concluded that the greater the formation of values, the less the mobile addiction. These correlations are especially significant regarding social values such as solidarity, inclusion, and justice, and personal values such as enthusiasm, patience, impartiality, openness of ideas, honesty, and balance. Likewise, there are significant differences depending on the educational stage; the younger the age, the less the mobile addiction. © 2021 by the authors.

The goal is to provide evidence for the improvement of existing and the thorough design of new EBL formats in sustainability programs. Design/methodology/approach: This comparative case study focuses on the first semester of three graduate sustainability programs at Leuphana University of Lüneburg, Germany and Arizona State University, USA, for two of which EBL was a core feature. The study compares the curricula, the teaching and learning environments and the reported experiences of one student cohort from each of three programs and synthesizes the resulting insights. Student interviews were combined with student self-assessments and supported by in-vivo observations, curriculum designer input, instructor interviews and course materials. MAXQDA was used for data analysis following a grounded theory approach. Findings: EBL influences students’ reflective capacity, which impacts the development of key competencies in sustainability. Qualitative analysis found four key themes in relation to the students’ learning in EBL settings, namely, discomfort, time-attention relationship, student expectations of instructors and exchange. The intersection of these themes with curricular structure, student dispositions and differing instructor approaches shows how curriculum can either support or interrupt the reflective cycle and thus, holistic learning. Research limitations/implications: With the focus on the first semester only, the students’ competence development over the course of the entire program cannot be demonstrated. Learning processes within EBL settings are complex and include aspects outside the control of instructors and curriculum designers. This study addresses only a select number of factors influencing students’ learning in EBL settings. Practical implications: Early engagement with EBL activities can push students to leave their comfort zones and question previous assumptions. Designing curricula to include EBL while encouraging strong intra-cohort connections and creating space for reflection seems to be an effective approach to enable the development of key competencies in sustainability. Originality/value: This paper investigates the experiences of students in EBL through a key competence lens. The study combines student self-perceptions, instructor reflections and in-vivo observations. Data collection and analysis were conducted by a researcher not affiliated with the programs. These factors make for a unique study design and with data-driven insights on the seldom researched competence-pedagogy-curriculum connection. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Education for sustainable development; Experience-based learning; Experiential learning; Higher learning; Key competencies in sustainability; Sustainability,,,,,,A115235,"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the Lower Saxony Ministry of Science and Culture and Volkswagen Foundation for the grant “Educating Future Change Agents – Higher Education as a Motor of the Sustainability Transformation” (A115235) through the program “Science for Sustainable Development.” The authors would also like to thank their colleagues Matthias Barth, Jan-Ole Brandt, Jantje Halberstadt, Theres Konrad, Jana Timm, Arnim Wiek and Marie Weiss from the Leuphana University of Lüneburg, Germany for support on the research design presented in this article, as well as for comments on the manuscript.

These were derived from small‐scale studies with designers working in the Netherlands. We set out to assess to what extent this set of seven competencies is recognized by an international group of designers and to evaluate whether any competencies are missing. We used an online survey to collect data from 128 respondents from 25 countries working on circular economy projects. The survey results showed that respondents use and have expertise in all seven competencies and they stressed the practical importance of two new competencies: Circular Systems Thinking and Circular Materials and Manufacturing. The resulting set of nine key competencies is the first internationally verified, coherent set of key circular economy competencies for design. This set will strengthen the pedagogical base of design for a circular economy and will guide the development of circular design methodology. © 2021 by the authors.

There is no fixed path to achieve sustainability and it is subject to human creativity. However, integrated development of both is surely an under-researched topic. Creative thinking and creative problem solving should be a necessary and significant component of modern sustainable education. Students must learn to associate creativity with sustainability. Helping them understand sustainability by exposing them to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and de-signing new creations that honor the planetary boundaries is crucial. The paper focuses on developing creativity by Polish teachers who work with adolescents. The assumption was that creativity can be developed using certain didactic methods and forms. The objective of the study was to ex-plore and to describe which didactic methods and forms teachers use to shape the competence of creativity in students. The teachers took part in a survey and were asked what methods and forms they use to develop creativity in their students. The sample consisted of 337 teachers from the Mało-polska region. The results of the analyses show that teachers use only a few of the methods recom-mended to facilitate creativity, which may lead to a low level of this competence among the stu-dents. They also use the most common didactic forms, which may not support the development of creativity competences. Moreover, the research results show that there are several factors, such as the teacher’s seniority and the location of the school, which determine the choice of individual teaching methods. © 2021 by the authors.

The process of integrating sustainability into education based on curricula assessment has been explained using adoption of innovations; and has the potential to explain the process of developing competences through pedagogical approaches. The aim of this paper is to investigate this process at academic discipline level. An online survey was developed to investigate teaching sustainability competences in 13 HEIs, from which 678 responses from educators were obtained. The competences and pedagogical approaches from the responses were ranked, and then the connections between the competences and pedagogical approaches per discipline were analysed using a correlations-based framework, from which three disciplines groups were created. The groups were categorised using diffusion of innovations theory, which indicated that some disciplines are more innovative than others in adopting sustainability competence-based teaching. The results are used to propose two frameworks to better understand the adoption of sustainability competence-based teaching: (a) the D-RAPID framework; and (b) the Disciplinary Multi-dimensional Sustainability Influence Change for Academia (D-MuSICA) memework. The adoption of sustainability competence-base education must expand from a single HEI perspective to a disciplinary collaborative one spanning many HEIs, where academic disciplines should learn from each other's insights and mistakes and provide students with more transdisciplinary skillsets to make societies more sustainable. © 2021 The Authors.

The main research problems tackled by the authors relate to: 1) identification of competences that would help academics, entrepreneurs and students to deal with uncertainty and to 2) convey the competences to the target groups through learning topics selected from futures studies and the entrepreneurship repertoire. The authors of the article undertook and coordinated theoretical and empirical research on foresight and Futures Literacy and its correspondence with entrepreneurship within the beFORE project funded under the Erasmus+ programme Knowledge Alliance scheme. The research process resulted in identification of 12 key competence items and development of the free approximately 34 hours long online course consisting of seven self-standing modules, 25 lessons and 79 learning topics corresponding to these competences. The originality of the paper is in its contribution to the discussion on the competences and online course contents that efficiently increase the capacities of using the future(s) in professional, academic and personal settings. © 2021 by the authors.",Competences; ELearning; Entrepreneurship; Foresight; Future-orientation; Futures Literacy; Long-term strategies,,,,,,"Ministerstwo Edukacji i Nauki, MNiSW",The research was carried out within beFORE – Becoming Future-Oriented Entrepreneurs in universities and companies Project funded by European Commission Erasmus + Programme – Key Action 2; Knowledge Alliances - Agreement n. 2016 - 2858 / 001 - 001 Project n. 515842-EPP-1-2016-1-PL-EPPKA2-KA.

Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study conducted an explorative experiment to elaborate on forms to advance a pedagogical approach that embeds sustainability. The design of the pedagogical project was explorative and interdisciplinary, using a predefined framework on key competencies for sustainability. Findings: The findings showed that an interdisciplinary approach can create a learning setting that stimulates students’ problem-solving competencies for sustainability-related issues. Students were trained in the five key sustainable competencies addressed by Wiek et al. (2011). Moreover, although it is not always possible to arrange an interdisciplinary pedagogical setting, this might be a key condition for the development of students’ key competencies regarding their understanding of the SDGs. Addressing the SDGs from an interdisciplinary perspective paved the way for the development of students’ strategic competencies, including systems thinking and anticipatory competencies. Practical implications: The pedagogical project, as an interdisciplinary explorative experiment, was shown to be a potentially suitable method to counteract “cherry-picking” approaches to teaching the SDGs at HEI. Originality/value: The pedagogical approach advanced in this paper, extends active learning and interdisciplinarity in higher education. The authors argue that this approach encourages students to take ownership of and responsibility for their learning process and indicates a changed mindset and behavior. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",(SDGs); Key competencies; Pedagogical approaches; Responsible management education; Sustainable development; Sustainable development goals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Albareda-Tiana, S., Vidal-Raméntol, S., Fernández-Morilla, M., Implementing the sustainable development goals at university level (2018) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 19 (3), pp. 473-497; Aleixo, A.M., Azeiteiro, U.M., Leal, S., Are the sustainable development goals being implemented in the portuguese higher education formative offer?

A prime question for employers, students, educators, and program administrators is what competencies these programs develop in students. This study explores convergence on competencies for sustainability programs. We conducted a Delphi study with 14 international experts in sustainability education on the framework of key competencies in sustainability by Wiek et al. (Sustain Sci 6: 203–218, 2011), the most frequently cited framework to date. While experts generally agreed with the framework, they propose two additional competencies, suggest a hierarchy of competencies, and specify learning objectives for students interested in a career as sustainability researcher. The refined framework can inform program development, implementation, and evaluation to enhance employability of graduates and facilitate comparison of sustainability programs worldwide. © 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",Curriculum development; Education for sustainable development; Key competencies; Learning objectives; Sustainability problem solving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amer, A., Reflections on Bloom's revised taxonomy (2006) Electron J Res Educ Psychol, 4 (1), pp. 213-230; Anderson, L., Krathwohl, R., Airasian, P., Cruikshank, K., Mayer, R., Pintrich, P., Raths, J., Wittrock, M., (2001) Taxonomy for learning, teaching, and assessing: a revision of Bloom's taxonomy, , (eds), Longman, New York; (2014) Environment and Sustainability Learning and Teaching Academic Standards Statement Project, , https://environmentltas.gradschool.edu.au/, .

A broader range of skills is required to learn, communicate, collaborate, and solve problems in digital environments. Twenty-first century skills have been identified by UNESCO, OECD, and others as competences required for a sustainable future of the knowledge society. The aim was to learn the design principles involved in the incorporation of these skills into the curriculum, find out possible ways to teach and assess them, and examine how this process could be personalized using Information and Communications Technology (ICT). A literature review was carried out through a qualitative metasynthesis, which identified 43 studies that met the inclusion criteria. From the in‐depth analysis, it can be seen that although the incorporation of 21st century skills into the curriculum, teaching methodologies, and the use of ICT are all recurrent themes, there is still a need for further research into the design and implementation of new instruments for assessment and the ways in which the teaching–learning process can be personalized. © 2020 by the authors.

Information Technology (IT) is now part of everyday life in society due to the proliferation of gadgets such as mobile phones, apps, computers, information systems, web-based systems, etc. (2) Methods: The analysis is based on recent ACM/IEEE curriculum guidelines for IT, a rigorous literature review as well as various viewpoints and their relevance for sustainability-oriented curriculum development; it also includes an assessment of key competencies in sustainability for proposed units in the IT curriculum. (3) Results: Sustainability is a critical subject for prospective IT professionals. Therefore, it is imperative to motivate and raise awareness among students and the faculty community regarding sustainability through its inclusion in the Informatics curriculum. This paper focuses on how sustainability can be included in various courses of the Informatics curriculum. It also considers recent ACM/IEEE curriculum guidelines for IT professionals, which assert that IT students should explore IT strategies required for developing a culture of green and sustainable IT. (4) Conclusions: This paper provides guidelines for IT curriculum development by incorporating sustainable elements in courses, so that future IT professionals can learn and practice sustainability in order to develop a sustainable society. © 2020 by the authors.",Curricula; Environment; Informatics; Information technology (IT); Sustainability,,,,,,"Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet, NTNU","""The APC was funded by XXX"".","Funding: The APC was funded by NTNU—Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway.",,,,,,,,,"(1987) Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our common future, 10, p. 300; Goodland, R., Sustainability: Human, social, economic and environmental (2002) Encycl.

This paper investigates the role of a study abroad program, the Engineers without Borders Design Summit, in promoting the acquisition of sustainability competencies in its students. This study analysed both content of the program pedagogy and the written learning reflections of 137 student participants to examine if the program resulted in sustainability competence acquisition. The study's findings suggested that students did acquire sustainability competencies during the program, but also that students may become competence-literate but context-lacking as they acquire competency skillsets without understanding their purpose for use as sustainability tools or to promote sustainability outcomes. Therefore, this study recommends that competence-based education for sustainability requires situation of competence acquisition within sustainability contextualisation to ensure full competence potential is fulfilled. This study suggests that contextualisation can occur in a number of ways, including the use of defined sustainability principles as boundary conditions to frame learning environments, the use of sustainability epistemic teachers as ""guides"" to connect learning to sustainability and the facilitation of student experiences with unsustainability to promote personally motivated action towards sustainability. © 2020 by the author.",Competencies; Education; Pedagogy; Study abroad; Sustainability,academic performance; data acquisition; design; education; learning; participatory approach; student; sustainability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Steffen, W., Broadgate, W., Deutsch, L., Gaffney, O., Ludwig, C., The trajectory of the Anthropocene: The Great Acceleration (2015) Anthr.

The findings classified eight secondary school ‘environment’ curriculum key competencies into three domains: intellect-oriented, personality-oriented, and relationship-oriented. The intellect-oriented domain includes ‘critical-thinking ability,’ ‘creativity,’ and ‘problem-solving ability’; the personality-oriented domain includes ‘autonomy,’ ‘ability to reflect,’ and ‘environmental sensitivity’; and the relationship-oriented domain includes ‘communication ability’ and ‘ability to manage conflicts.’ These environmental competencies were utilized to revise the current environmental education curriculum as part of the 2015 revision of the National Curriculum and set the key competencies for environment classes.

Box 27, Helsinki, 00014, Finland","Sustainability science is an emerging, free-standing scientific discipline. It has introduced a new approach to both sustainability research and educational programmes, while evoking novel perspectives to stronger societal contextualization. Among several other areas of sustainability research, competencies for sustainability have become a focal topic of sustainability education research. This research explores the educational programmes and the representation of the theory-based key competencies for sustainability. Through a qualitative content study of 45 master programmes associated with sustainability science, we aim to understand what kind of sustainability competencies can be found in sustainability science master’s programmes and how they reflect the current discussions of the discipline of sustainability science and possibly drive the future education in the field. The study reveals that commonly suggested competencies including systems thinking, anticipatory, strategic, interpersonal, and normative competencies were frequently mentioned as content and learning outcomes in the curricula and are firmly present and widely employed in sustainability education. Additionally, this study identified three other clusters of competencies: diverse modes of thinking, methodological plurality, and competencies for autonomy. In addition to the contribution to education in the field by suggesting three emerged competencies for sustainability science specifically, we aim to contribute to the ongoing discussion about the discipline by suggesting a process-oriented framing of sustainability science. © 2019, The Author(s).",Competencies; Curriculum development; Education for sustainable development; Higher education; Sustainability professional; Sustainability science,,,,,,,Open access funding provided by University of Helsinki including Helsinki University Central Hospital.,This work was done with the support of Tiina and Antti Herlin Foundation.

One of the fields that more urgently needs to utilize the potential benefits of ICT to transform learning is sustainability, and more precisely the development of sustainability competences (SCs). Indeed, wider societal changes are needed that ensure a balance between economic growth, respect for the environment, and social justice, and these changes must start with individual action, knowledge, and the capacity and willingness to act (i.e., the definition of ""competence""). However, although there is a wide consensus on the fact that education should ensure the acquisition of competences for life, making this a reality may be more problematic. This difficulty stems, partly, from a lack of a definition of the intervening elements (knowledge, skills, values, attitudes) that enables the integration of competences into specific learning sequences and activities. Taking into account all the above and the difficulties that teachers face in choosing relevant resources and incorporating competences into their planning, we propose a series of indicators that serve to characterize the four dimensions of scientific competence: contents of science, contents about science, the value of science, and the utility of science in educational materials. Although primarily intended for filtering multimedia resources in an educational platform, this instrument (as well as the indicators therein) can be extrapolated to the selection and management of a variety of resources and activities, eventually selecting those that are more useful for the acquisition of the scientific competence. They can also provide learning-managers with a common ground to work on by sharing the objectives and indicators related to the acquisition of competences. © 2020 by the authors.",Competence-based education; Education for sustainable development; Educational planning; Evaluation of digital resources; Scientific competence,education; information and communication technology; learning; sustainability; teaching,,,,,0011-1365-2018-000124,"Funding: This research was funded by the Department of Education, Gobierno de Navarra, “grant number 0011-1365-2018-000124” and “The APC was funded by grant number 0011-1365-2018-000124”.",,,,,,,,,,"Survey of Schools: ICT in Education (2013) Benchmarking Access, Use and Attitudes to Technology in Europe's Schools, p. 163. , https://publications.europa.eu/en/publicationdetail/-/publication/ceb8a8b5-f342-4890-8323-4000e99deb3d, accessed on 10 May 2017; Páramo, M.B., Pérez, R., Ruiz, F.J., Metodologías activas para la formación con tecnologías (2016) Formación Para la Educación con Tecnologías, pp. 84-91. , Gallego-Arrufat, M.J., Raposo, M., Eds.; Pirámide: Madrid, Spain; Area Moreira, M., Correa, J.M., Las TIC entran en las escuelas (2010) Nuevos retos educativos, nuevas prácticas docentes.

While project-based learning formats claim to advance such skills, there is little empirical evidence that demonstrates how interpersonal competence is being developed. This study aims to describe and explains teaching and learning processes of project-based sustainability courses that contribute to the development of interpersonal competence as one of the key competencies in sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: This study on an international project-based learning course adopted a multi-method case study approach, triangulating observations, semi-structured interviews and focus groups supported by Photovoice method through which students tracked their learning processes. Data collection and analysis followed a grounded theory approach. Findings: Learning through and from conflicts within a learning community can foster competence development in teamwork, communication and stakeholder engagement. This study identified inner and outer conflicts (within individuals versus between individuals or groups) as potential drivers of learning processes, depending on strategies applied to address these conflicts. Originality value: The value of this study is fourfold: it demonstrates how conflicts can be leveraged for students’ competence development; it provides in-depth empirical data from multiple perspectives, it discusses the findings in the context of teaching and learning theories, and it demonstrates an application of the Photovoice method to track and improve teaching and learning processes. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Change agents; Education for sustainable development; Experiential learning; Key competencies in sustainability; Project-based learning; Teaching and learning processes,,,,,,"A115235; Leuphana Universität Lüneburg, LUL","The authors would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions.

It looks at three different urban master’s programs in Serbia (Belgrade) and Germany (Berlin and Stuttgart). Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, students' assessments of the pedagogical model, individual learning outcomes and the long-term value of the pedagogical model in respect of key competences for sustainability are presented and discussed. Basic assumptions of the study include that assessment from the students' perspective can provide feedback on the transformational learning experience with the aim of improving the experience and thus learning outcomes; help identify limitations and target specific areas for improvement in the pedagogical model; and improve the evaluation of effectiveness in developing knowledge and skills for sustainability in HPE. Findings: The paper provides evidence that a learner-centered and action-oriented approach, as well as a global dialogue among peers from different backgrounds and nationalities, is an effective way to educate future generations of urban planners to become “change agents” for societal transformation toward a more sustainable future within their respective contexts. Originality/value: The paper is a supplement to the existing research on educational initiatives that attempts to integrate sustainability into the curricula, especially of urban-related programs; showcases outcomes of the pedagogical model(s) for sustainable development applied, especially when addressing the competences of students working in developing, transitional and developed countries or different geographic contexts; and shows long-term learning outcomes after the students move into work practice. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Education for sustainable development; Higher planning education; Learning outcomes; Pedagogical model; Students’ perspective,,,,,,"European Commission, EC; Erasmus+; Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit, GIZ","Cooperation was supported by the GIZ/AMBERO–ICON project “Strengthening local land management in Serbia”, Obrenovac and Stari Grad municipalities, and the ERASMUS program funding by the European Union.

Many studies have examined chef competencies, but we have not yet discovered how to measure the chefs’ key competencies according to culinary student perceptions. This study involved 392 culinary students in public vocational high schools. Data was collected by proportional random sampling through a questionnaire distributed to seven public vocational schools in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Questionnaire validation used three techniques, namely, content validity test with Aiken V analysis, small sample validity test with Pearson correlation analysis, and finally, CFA analysis. This study shows that culinary students' perceptions of chefs’ key competencies can be explained by indicators of creativity, culinary skills, hygiene & food safety, aesthetics, business sense, interpersonal, managerial, and leadership. Chefs’ Key Competencies Questionnaire (CKCQ) consists of 30 items consisting of creative (3 items), culinary skills (5 items), hygiene & food safety (4 items), aesthetics (2 items), business sense (4 items), interpersonal (3 items), managerial (4 items), and leadership (5 items). All items (30 items) have good validity and reliability values. The findings of this study discuss in-depth and some implications for vocational education practitioners proposed for further improvement. VET practitioners can also use this questionnaire to evaluate the achievement of the chefs’ key competencies of culinary students and professional chefs. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publishers’ Office.",CFA; Chef; Core competencies; Culinary expertise; Key competencies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aiken, L.

The following two questions were addressed: Q1. What kind of sustainability competences do participants acquire in the Master Class? Q2. What is the role of PBL in the learning outcomes? Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on an ex ante open-ended survey and post-ante interviews addressed to the participants. The data were analysed using the qualitative content analysis. Findings: The findings show that the Master Class contributed to most of the competences under study. However, unlike in previous studies, systemic thinking is highlighted as a fundamental rather than a parallel core competence. Furthermore, the results also emphasise the role of emotions, which is insufficiently acknowledged and accounted for in sustainability education. Research limitations/implications: The study focussed only on the learning outcomes of the participants (students) and not the other parties (such as company and researchers). Practical implications: Future research should focus on affective dimension as a stepping stone to the transformational learning. In addition, the role of the systemic understanding in sustainability education should be highlighted as a core competence. Social implications: The study revealed the overall positive impacts of the co-creation in university – business collaboration to the participants’ sustainability competences. Originality/value: The study presents an empirical case study where the various competence frameworks were applied with a result of confirming the validity of the existing key competences, in particular the systemic understanding and showing the role of the affective dimension in the transactional learning. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Co-creation; Competences; Master class; Project based learning; Sustainability; Transactional learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bäckman, M., Pitt, H., Marsden, T., Mathijs, E., Experiential approaches to sustainability education: towards learning landscapes (2019) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 20 (1), pp. 139-156; Berg, B., (2009) Qualitative Research Methods for the Social Sciences, , 7th ed., AllBi and Bacon, Boston MA; Birdsall, S., Measuring student teachers’ understandings and self-awareness of sustainability Sally Birdsall (2014) Environmental Education Research, 20 (6), pp. 814-835; Bovill, C., Cook-Sather, A., Felten, P., Addressing potential challenges in co-creating learning and teaching: overcoming resistance, navigating institutional norms and ensuring inclusivity in student–staff partnerships (2016) Higher Education, 71 (2), pp. 195-208; Ceulemans, K., De Prins, M., Teacher's manual and method for SD integration in curricula (2010) Journal of Cleaner Production, 18 (7), pp. 645-651; de Haan, G., The development of ESD-related competencies in supportive institutional frameworks (2010) International Review of Education, 56 (2-3), pp. 315-328; Deci, E.L., Ryan, R.M., The ‘what’ and ‘why’ of goal pursuits: human needs and the self-determination of behaviour (2000) Psychological Inquiry, 11 (4), pp. 227-268; Downe-Wamboldt, B., Content analysis: method, applications, and issues (1992) Health Care for Women International, 13, pp. 313-321; Fernandes, S., Preparing graduates for professional practice: findings from a case study of project-based learning (PBL) (2014) Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences, 139, pp. 219-226; Filho, W., Shiel, C., Paço, A., Implementing and operationalising integrative approaches to sustainability in higher education: the role of project-oriented learning (2016) Journal of Cleaner Production, 133, pp. 126-135; Fini, R., Rasmussen, E., Wiklund, J., Wright, M.A., Theories from the lab: how research on science commercialization can contribute to management studies (2019) Journal of Management Studies, 56 (5), pp. 865-894; Fuertes-Camacho, M.T., Graell-Martin, M., Fuentes-Loss, M., Balaquer-Fabregas, C., Integrating sustainability into higher education curricula through the project method, a global learning strategy (2019) Sustainability, 11 (3), p. 767. , https://doi.org/10.3390/su11030767; Gough, S., Scott, W., (2003) Sustainable Development and Learning: Framing the Issues, , Routledge, London; Grinstedt, T., Educating geographers in an era of the anthropocene: paradoxical natures – paradoxical cultures (2015) Journal of Cleaner Production, 106, pp. 320-329; Helle, L., Tynjälä, P., Olkinuora, E., Project-Based learning in post-secondary education – theory, practice and rubber sling shots (2006) Higher Education, 51 (2), pp. 287-314; Immordino‐Yang, M.H., (2016) Emotions, Learning, and the Brain: Exploring the Educational Implications of Affective Neuroscience, p. 208. , p., W.W.

It investigates whether mindfulness training can cultivate the ability to introspect and stimulate the development of KCSCs. Design/methodology/approach: Two independent studies were analyzed. Data were retrieved from interviews with participants of a consumer-focused mindfulness training (Study 1, 11 participants), as well as from diaries of students attending a university seminar with mindfulness training (Study 2, 13 students), and made subject to qualitative content analysis. Findings: Both studies show a clear intersection between both constructs and suggest that mindfulness training can contribute to the development of KCSCs and learners’ ability to introspect. The studies also demonstrated that introspection is not equally related to all competencies and that KCSCs must not be reduced to introspection. Research limitations/implications: Both KCSCs and introspection are complex and latent constructs and hence challenging to observe. The research understands itself as a first exploratory approach for empirically investigating this complex relation. Originality/value: While increasing (self-)reflectivity is at the core of competence-based education, a systematic engagement with the practice of introspection as a means to enhancing reflectivity is surprisingly lacking. Mindfulness training could be a promising way to cultivate introspective abilities and thus facilitate learning processes that are conducive to competence development. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Higher education for sustainable consumption; Introspection; Key competencies for sustainable consumption; Mindfulness; Qualitative content analysis; Reflectivity; Sustainable consumption,,,,,,"01UT1416, 01UT1416B; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF",Study 1 of the present work was funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) in the project BiNKA (Education for Sustainable Consumption through Mindfulness Training) under grants 01UT1416 and 01UT1416B.,,,,,,,,,,"Adomßent, M., Fischer, D., Godemann, J., Herzig, C., Otte, I., Rieckmann, M., Timm, J.-M., Emerging areas in research on higher education for sustainable development e management education, sustainable consumption and perspectives from Central and Eastern Europe (2014) Journal of Cleaner Production, 62 (1), pp. 1-7; Barth, M., Godemann, J., Rieckmann, M., Stoltenberg, U., Developing key competencies for sustainable development in higher education (2007) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 8 (4), pp. 416-430; Bishop, S.R., Lau, M., Shapiro, S., Carlson, L., Anderson, N.D., Carmody, J., Segal, Z.V., Devins, G., Mindfulness: a proposed operational definition (2004) Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice, 11 (3), pp. 230-241; Bitbol, M., Petitmengin, C., On the possibility and reality of introspection (2016) Mind and Matter, 14 (1), pp. 51-75; Chiesa, A., Calati, R., Serretti, A., Does mindfulness training improve cognitive abilities?

Goal 4 promotes quality education and Target 4.7 specifically addresses Education for Sustainability. However, creating a monitoring and evaluation framework for Target 4.7 has been challenging. The aim of this research was to develop a meaningful assessment process. We used a dialogical intervention across complementary expertises and piloted concepts in a trainer workshop. We then developed a modified competency framework, drawing on previous competency models but innovating through the addition of intrapersonal competencies, a self-reflective validation scheme, a focus on non-formal learning, and specific alignment with SDG 4.7 requirements. Through exploration of how such learning could be activated, we proposed the use of multiple intelligences. Education plays a synergistic role in achieving the aspirations embedded within Agenda 2030 and the SDGs. We concluded that Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) will require individuals to acquire 'key competencies', aligning with notions of transformational learning, in addition to other generic and context specific competencies. © 2019 by the authors.",Education for sustainable development; Evaluation framework; Key competencies; SDG 4; Sustainable development goals; Transformative learning,education; learning; sustainability; sustainable development; United Nations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ferraro, E., White, R.M., Cox, E., Bebbington, K.J., Wilson, S., Craft and sustainable development: Reflections on Scottish craft and pathways to sustainability (2010) Craft + Des.

The recent trend of the application of Agile methodologies for the management of projects in different fields can be a valuable tool to convey these competencies due to the participative, collaborative and constructionist principles in which they are deeply rooted. Some experiences of the application of Agile Methodologies in education-originating what is known as Agile Education-are, therefore, starting to appear in the literature. This work carries out a systematic review to analyze how this modern pedagogical tool is being used to foster key sustainable development competencies in the field of education. Results are presented for 11 out of 121 analyzed studies which present a direct link between key ESD competencies and Agile Education. It is shown that Agile Education creates a learning environment favorable for the creation of responsible and sustainable citizens while improving the performance, satisfaction and motivation of both faculty and students. © 2019 by the authors.",Agile methodologies; Competency-based learning; Education; Education for sustainability; Kanban; Project-based learning; Scrum,education; learning; literature review; methodology; project management; student; sustainability; sustainable development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Royle, K., Nikolic, J., A modern mixture, Agency, Capability, Technology and 'Scrum': AgileWork (2016) J.

This study is based on the implementation of the Visual Arts in Education (VA.E) project and the development of a programme of socialization and training for teachers of schools in area 6 of the city of Mixco in Guatemala. The participant observation and research action are the core methodological tools to study four key competences, namely critical analysis, systemic analysis, collaborative work or work through projects, and commitment to society. The results were obtained from the analysis of the competences and capacities acquired during the training process, in which students and teachers participated and expressed through observable learning conducts or achievements. The proposal aims to contribute to the study of the impact of Visual Thinking as a tool for teaching-learning of students in rural schools, and of teaching practices based on the acquisition of competences for sustainable development that can be assumed by teachers in all educational levels and contexts. © 2019 by the authors.",Competences; Education; Sustainable development; Visual Thinking,education; learning; memory; rural area; sustainable development; teaching; training; Guatemala [Central America],,,,,"181/226 MECD; Universidad Camilo José Cela, UCJC","Funding: This research was supported by a grant–in-aid awarded by the Vicerrectorate of Innovation and Research of the Camilo José Cela University, funded by Subdirección General de Promoción del Arte del Ministerio de Educación, Cultura, y Deporte, grant number (181/226 MECD)”.","Acknowledgments: This research was supported by a grant–in-aid awarded by the Vicerrectorate of Innovation and Research of the Camilo José Cela University.We would like to express our thanks to the persons in charge of the Education Area of the Social Work Secretariat, SOSEA of the municipality of Mixco, Guatemala, as well as the persons in charge of the Department of Education of the University of Istmo, Guatemala for signing the agreement for implementation of the Visual Arts in Education (VA.E) project in the rural schools of the municipality of Mixco.",,,,,,,,,"Aguado, T., Malik, B., Intercultural education: Teacher training and school practice (2006) Intercult.

The role of higher education is essential for providing future professionals with the necessary profiles to respond to the sustainability challenges in increasingly complex and global contexts. That is why numerous authors have sought to define key competencies, skills and learning outcomes for sustainability. However, there is still no agreement on what these key competencies for sustainability in higher education really are. For that reason, the objective of this paper is to determine which are the sustainability core competencies, considering three different geographical regions (Europe, Latin America, and Central Asia), and the perspective of four different stakeholders (graduates, employers, students and academics). The framework of the research is the development of the so-called Tuning projects, which aim to design comparable and compatible higher education degrees in different regions of the world, based on student-centered and competency-based learning. Using an exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the results of this study reveal the existence of a factor intimately related to sustainability, which includes competencies such as commitment to the preservation of the environment, social responsibility or respect for diversity and multiculturality, among others. © 2019 by the authors.",Business and management education; Education for sustainability; Education for sustainable development; Higher education; Sustainability competencies,business development; factor analysis; higher education; learning; perception; stakeholder; sustainability; sustainable development; Central Asia; Europe; Latin America,,,,,"European Commission, EC","Acknowledgments: The authors gratefully acknowledge Tuning Academy, for giving them the opportunity to participate in different Tuning Projects, financed by the European Commission.","To date, 34 projects with the collaboration of over 600 academics in 118 countries have been carried out.

International initiatives to promote education for sustainable development (ESD) have been hampered by a lack of clarity on how to implement this form of education. To address this concern, a Rounder Sense of Purpose (RSP) began as a three-year EU-funded project that set out to develop a practical accreditation model for educators working on ESD. Expert and user opinion was sought through several rounds of structured consultation with over 500 people, chiefly using a Delphi approach, to develop and validate the model. The resulting framework comprises 12 competences, each with three learning outcomes and several underpinning components. This is supported by a range of activities largely reflecting a constructivist pedagogy. A range of assessment techniques have also been piloted within the project although this remains an area for further enquiry. Ultimately, it was decided not to design a single qualification template because defining the award to such a level of detail would make it more difficult to apply across multiple jurisdictions. Partners also felt that such an approach would atomize learning in a way that runs counter to the holistic principles of sustainability. RSP provided a rich learning experience for those involved and has already demonstrated its potential to extend its impact well beyond the original participants. © 2019 by the authors.",Competence framework; Competences; ESD; Teacher education,economic growth; education; education policy; European Union; holistic approach; learning; sustainability; sustainable development; teaching; training,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sterling, S., Assuming the Future: Repurposing Education in a Volatile Age (2017) Post-Sustainability and Environmental Education: Remaking Education for the Future, , Jickling, B., Sterling, S., Eds.; Palgrave: Cham, Switzerland; Hardoon, D., Ayele, S., Fuentes-Nieva, R., An Economy for the 1%: How Privilege and Power in the Economy Drive Extreme Inequality and How This Can Be Stopped (2016), https://oxf.am/2FKbYYL, Oxfam International: Oxford, UK (accessed on 26 November 2018); Firth, R., Winter, C., Constructing Education for Sustainable Development: The Secondary School Geography Curriculum and Initial Teacher Training (2007) Environ.

Moreover, the variety of involved stakeholders (planners, tenants, housing companies, private landlords, energy consultants, etc.) represents conflicting aims for solving this problem. This paper aims to present a systematic linkage between higher education for sustainable development (HESD) and education about energy poverty yet. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative comparative case study approach with a similar didactic approach is used. Findings: Based on the literature about HESD and an overall model in general didactics, ten criteria were identified and used for an overall reflection about similar courses dealing with the topic of energy poverty. The criteria covered the learning goals, the didactical approaches and the institutional support in the forms of organisation in the courses. Research limitations/implications: There was no competency measurement of the students in the described courses. Practical implications: There was no evaluation of the development of students’ key competencies for sustainability. However, the reflections of students and teachers revealed a positive development regarding the students’ learning process, especially because they worked on a real-world sustainability problem: energy poverty. Originality/value: This contribution describes how university courses on energy poverty were designed and implemented at five German universities. Against the background of general criteria for HESD, it reflects on the experiences that the use of this concept evoked. Through a comparison of the five courses against these criteria, the paper outlines strengths and weaknesses of the approach and closes with recommendations and requirements for designing further courses. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Competency development; Energy poverty; Higher education for sustainable development; Problem- and project-based learning; Wicked-sustainability problems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alvarez, A., Rogers, J., Going ‘out there’: learning about sustainability in place (2006) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 7 (2), pp. 176-188; Barrows, H.S., Problem-based learning in medicine and beyond (1996) Bringing Problem-Based Learning to Higher Education, pp. 3-12. , Wilkerson, L.A. and Gijselaers, W.H.,(Eds), Jossey-Bass, San-Francisco; Barth, M., Godeman, J., Rieckmann, M., Stoltenberg, U., Developing key competencies for sustainable development in higher education (2007) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 8 (4), pp. 416-430; Barth, M., Michelsen, G., Rieckmann, M., Thomas, I., (2016) Routledge Handbook of Higher Education for Sustainable Development, , (Eds) (, Routledge, London; Blömke, S., Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia, O., (2013) The german funding initiative ‘modeling and measuring competencies in higher education’: 23 research projects on engineering, economics and social sciences, education and generic skills of higher education students, , www.kompetenzen-im-hochschulsektor.de/Dateien/KoKoHs_WP3_Bloemeke_Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia_2013_neu.pdf, (Eds) (: accessed 27 February 2014; Bouzarovski, S., Geographies of energy poverty and vulnerability in the European union (2017) Energie Und Soziale Ungleichheit, pp. 29-53. , Großmann, K., Schaffrin, A. and Smigiel, C.,(Eds), Springer, Wiesbaden; Brundiers, K., Wiek, A., Do we teach what we preach?

Implemented at schools, ESD addresses specific topics, e.g. globalization or pollutants in clothing. This study investigates what challenges are connected with such issues in class and how students deal with issues of sustainable development at German secondary schools. Several teaching units in different subjects and schools were video- and audiotaped. The empirical material was analysed using the Documentary Method (a qualitative reconstructive approach) to describe students’ competences that emerged within different pedagogical arrangements. We identified three key competences that provide important skills for handling issues in ESD that deal (1) with the state of not knowing, (2) with perspectivity, and (3) with calls to action. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",classroom research; Documentary Method; Education for sustainable development; student strategies,,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: DFG-GRK1195/2; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung, BMZ: FEB-045-245/10",This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (2009–2010) [grant number DFG-GRK1195/2] and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (2010–2012) [grant number FEB-045-245/10].,,,,,,,,,,"Adomßent, M., Hoffmann, T., (2013) The Concept of Competencies in the Context of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), , https://esd-expert.net/de/was-wir-tun/materialien/; Aikens, K., McKenzie, M., Vaughter, P., Environmental and Sustainability Education Policy Research: A Systematic Review of Methodological and Thematic Trends (2016) Environmental Education Research, 22 (3), pp. 333-359; Andreasen Lysgaard, J., Simovska, V., The Significance of ‘Participation’ as an Educational Ideal in Education for Sustainable Development and Health Education in Schools (2016) Environmental Education Research, 22 (5), pp. 613-630; Applis, S., Analysis of the Possibilities for Discussing Questions of Global Justice in Geography Classes on the Use of Methods of Empirical Social Research When Analyzing the Teaching of Geography in Class (2015) International Research in Geographical and Environmental Education, 24 (3), pp. 273-285; Asbrand, B., How Adolescents Learn about Globalisation and Development (2008) Development Education, Debates and Dialogues, pp. 28-44. , Bourn D., (ed), London: Institute of Education, University of London,. edited by; Asbrand, B., Martens, M., Qualitative Kompetenzforschung im Lernbereich Globale Entwicklung: Das Beispiel Perspektivenübernahme (2013) Bildung für nachhaltige Entwicklung.

Particularly in the socio-scientific context of sustainable development, decision-making is required for the processing of information and the implementation of sustainable action. Extracurricular activities in education for sustainable development (ESD) offer a suitable format to promote decision-making due to their multidisciplinary and more informal structure. The purpose of this literature review is therefore to analyze empirical studies that explore students' (1) decision-making in (2) ESD-related (3) extracurricular activities. Following the preferred-reporting of items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic search yielded 19 out of 365 articles, each of them addressing all three components. Despite the theoretical relationship, hardly any empirical enquiry is found examining the trinomial interrelation with an equal consideration of all components. Contrarily, we argue that each is positioned in favor for only one component with the others serving as a backdrop. It follows that the full potential of an equal distribution between all three foci has not been explored yet; even though integrating sustainability-related issues in extracurricular activities displays a promising learning opportunity to optimally foster students' decision-making. Instead, studies that concentrate primarily on decision-making as a quantitatively measurable competence were predominant. © 2018 by the authors.",Decision-making; Education for sustainable development; Extracurricular activities,decision making; education; empirical analysis; literature review; meta-analysis; student; sustainable development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wang, Y., Ruhe, G., The Cognitive Process of Decision Making (2007) Int.

A sustainable consciousness is one of themain foundations for determining the key competences for sustainability. However, there are notmany empirical studies that deal with consciousness from education. In this context, the e-portfolio appears as a tool that promotes reflection and critical thinking, which are key competences for consciousness development. This work intends to propose a categorization system to extract types of consciousness and identify the levels of consciousness of teachers in training. For this research work, which is of an eminently qualitative nature, we have selected 25 e-portfolios of students (teachers in pre-service training) in the last year of the School of Education at the University of Macerata (Italy). The qualitative methodological procedure that was followed enabled deducing three bases that shape the consciousness of teachers in training: thinking, representation of reality, and type of consciousness. We concluded that the attainment of a sustainable consciousness in teachers requires activating and developing higher levels of thinking, as well as a projective and macrostructural representation of reality. © 2018 by the authors.",Consciousness; E-portfolios; Education; ICT; Sustainability,education; educational attainment; educational development; identification method; information and communication technology; research work; sustainability; sustainable development; teaching; training; Italy; Macerata; Marche,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Education for Sustainable Development Goals (2017) Learning Objectives, , http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002474/247444e.pdf, UNESCO: Paris, France (accessed on 31 July 2018); (2005) UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005-2014), , http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001416/141629e.pdf, Education for Sustainable Development (ED/PEQ/ESD), Division for the Promotion of Quality Education, UNESCO: Paris, France (accessed on 31 July 2018); (2005) UNESCO and Sustainable Development, , http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001393/139369e.pdf, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO: Paris, France (accessed on 31 July 2018); (2005) United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005-2014): International Implementation Scheme, , http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001486/148654e.pdf, Education for Sustainable Development (ED/PEQ/ESD), Division for the Promotion of Quality Education, UNESCO: Paris, France (accessed on 31 July 2018); Education for Sustainable Development Toolkit Learning & Training Tools No, , http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0015/001524/152453eo.pdf, 1 Section for Education for Sustainable Development (ED/UNP/ESD), UNESCO Paris, France, 2006 (accessed on 31 July 2018); Education for Sustainable Development (2012) SOURCEBOOK, , http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002163/216383e.pdf, (accessed on 31 July 2018); United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO: Paris, France; Bonn Declaration (2009) In Proceedings of the UNESCOWorld Conference on Education for Sustainable Development, , http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001887/188799e.pdf, Bonn, Germany, 31 March-2 April (accessed on 31 July 2018); Selwyn, N., The use of ICT in education and the promotion of social inclusion: A critical perspective from the UK (2008) Educação Sociedade, 29, pp. 815-850; Sangra, A., Gonzalez-Sanmamed, M., The role of information and communication technologies in improving teaching and learning processes in primary and secondary schools (2010) Res.

Teachers as agents of a new mindset do not seem to understand the ways of approaching raising awareness of the issues of global challenges. This study investigated the possibility of raising the extent of applying critical thinking to the problem-solving issues of a group of student teachers in their initial training. The sample consisted of 48 student teachers. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used: namely, a questionnaire, content analysis, and focus group interviews. An archive of the students' materials was also used for content analysis. In the data analysis, inter-rater reliability, as well as parametric (t-test) and non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U test) were applied. The results of the study provide evidence of the positive impact of the use of case studies in teaching pre-service teachers on the development of their critical thinking skills. It can be concluded that it should not be taken for granted that teachers automatically know how to develop the competencies that are necessary for sustainable development (SD). Instead, teacher education institutions need to incorporate thorough training that focusses on education for sustainable development (ESD) into the entire teacher programme in order to make sure that the teachers leave their initial training well prepared for guaranteeing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). © 2018 by the authors.",Critical thinking; Education for sustainable development; Key competencies for sustainable development; Reflection; Teacher education,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Evans, N., Stevenson, R.B., Lasen, M., Ferreira, J.-A., Davis, J., Approaches to embedding sustainability in teacher education: A synthesis of literature (2017) Teach.

Within the competence-based teaching framework, this training activity involves cooperative learning as it combines first-undergraduate and senior students within one team. First, we explore how some key competences are initially appreciated by first-year students. Second, our research empirically assesses how the simulation modifies students’ awareness of those competences. Results of the pretest reveal that senior students’ awareness on key competences is higher than of first-undergraduate students. In particular, communication skills are initially not considered as relevant by the first-year students. Results of the posttest reveal that our intervention significantly improves first-undergraduates’ awareness of technical accounting knowledge and communication skills. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",communication skills; competence-based education; Cooperative learning; leadership; teamwork; workplace simulation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ameen, E., Jackson, C., Malgwi, C., Student perceptions of oral communication in the accounting profession requirements (2010) Global Perspectives on Accounting Education, 7, pp. 31-49; Andrews, J., Higson, H., Graduate employability, ‘soft skills’ versus ‘hard’ business knowledge: A European study (2008) Higher Education in Europe, 33 (4), pp. 411-422; Arnold, J., Loan-Clarke, J., Harrington, A., Hart, C., Students’ perceptions of competence development in undergraduate business-related degrees (1999) Studies in Higher Education, 24 (1), pp. 43-59; Atchison, M., Pollock, S., Reeders, E., Rizzetti, J., (1999) Guide to WIL, , Melbourne: RMIT University; Atchison, M., Pollock, S., Reeders, E., Rizzetti, J., (2002) Work integrated learning paper, , Melbourne: RMIT University; Baer, J., Grouping and achievement in cooperative learning (2003) College Teaching, 51, pp. 169-175; Baker, S., Reflection, doubt, and the place of rethoric in postmoderm social theory (1990) Sociological Theory, 8 (2), pp. 232-245; Barral, A., Bautista, R., Molina, H., (2015) Orientaciones Pedagógicas sobre Aplicación de las Normas Internacionales de Auditoría, , http://www.ctcp.gov.co/_files/documents/DOC_CTCP_R6GQF_200.pdf, Retrieved from; Bautista, R., De Vicente, M., La enseñanza en un entorno de trabajo simulado como metodología docente: El caso de los servicios de auditoría (2012) Calidad, evaluación y encuestas de la docencia universitaria, pp. 341-352. , Castro A., Chocrón A.M., Fernández R., García D.I., Igartua M.T., Marín I., Roales E., Rubio M.D., Sierra E.M., Sánchez-Rodas D.A., Solís C., (eds), Murcia: Ediciones Laborum, &,.

Design/methodology/approach: The pedagogical model is based on the principles of education for sustainable development and focuses on the establishment of a repeatable platform for dialogue between students and mentors, members of the mentoring team, the local community, external members of the consulting team of experts and foreign master’s degree programmes, in the process of producing students’ projects. The proposed method addresses several dimensions, including: the education of students, teachers, professionals and local experts, the establishment of a network for cooperation and collaboration and the delivery of practical and usable results. Findings: The paper provides a comparative overview of the pedagogical model’s application in producing the final master’s degree projects of three generations of students, as well as its alignment with the needs of re-defining the role and reach of the profession of urban planner in an environment of post-socialist transition. The model was improved, enhanced and optimised through this process and then corroborated with its practical implementation. Originality/value: The innovative pedagogical model comprises an instrument to enhance the professional capacities of all participants in the production of final master’s projects: academics, practitioners and future professionals/students, through discussions of topical issues, innovative modes of work and new professional responses grounded in the local context and tested by a broad range of stakeholders. It is of particular importance for countries in transition experiencing a shift in the paradigm of professional action, especially as the proposed pedagogical model establishes a problem-solving platform that surpasses academia. © 2018, Marija Maruna, Danijela Milovanovic Rodic and Ratka Colic.",Curriculum development; Integrated urbanism; Paradigm change; Post-social transitional country; Urban planning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(1995) Core requirements for a high quality European planning education, , www.aesop-planning.eu/en_GB/core-curriculum, (accessed: 1 May 2017; Andersen, H.T., Nolmark, H., Atkinson, R., Mur, T., Troeva, V., (2009) Urban knowledge arenas: rethinking urban knowledge and innovation, , Final Report of Coast Action C20, European CooperationScience and Technology – COST, Brussels; Bajić, B.M., Societies in transition and planning education: the case of the West Balkan countries (2012) HESP: Higher Education in Spatial Planning, pp. 152-166. , Scholl, B.

To train sustainability experts, sustainability science programs and sustainability-focused courses are offered in higher education, especially at the graduate level. Given the diverse topics and the complex structures of sustainability challenges, what are the required knowledge and skills needed for sustainability experts? Although the earlier literature identified key features and competencies, empirical studies on how educational programs in sustainability science provide the necessary training are still scarce. This study addresses this gap by illustrating how a field-based course can contribute in developing core skills for fostering sustainability experts through a case study of field-based course called Global Field Exercise (GFE) in the Graduate Program in Sustainability Science-Global Leadership Initiative (GPSS-GLI) at The University of Tokyo. Literature review on the competencies in sustainability science suggests a three-way typology of descriptive-analytical skills, solution-oriented skills, and attitudinal skills. A group of students joined a GFE unit in Akita, Japan, and set ""local food and place attachment"" as the topic for their fieldwork. The participants conducted semi-structured interviews to three generational groups to illustrate the different perceptions of local food and places. The alternative mechanism of knowledge transmission across generations by local festivals and school events was found. The authors observed the implemented field-based course provided unique learning opportunities to acquire: (i) the ability to perform key competencies collectively instead of individually; (ii) an interdisciplinary-mindset to acknowledge multiple views to topics during group discussions among researchers; (iii) a transdisciplinary-mindset to communicate research outputs with local residents in a communicable way; (iv) the ability to be empathetic to people's experiences when addressing normative dimensions of sustainability. Although different sets of competencies and approaches for fostering sustainability experts have been studied widely, the field-based approach plays an important role in developing transdisciplinary, interpersonal, and normative competences. © 2018 by the authors.",Aging society; Competencies; Empathetic competence; Field-based education; Interdisciplinary-mindset; Local food; Sustainability science; Transdisciplinary-mindset,academic research; aging population; education; educational development; higher education; interdisciplinary approach; learning; perception; questionnaire survey; rural population; student; sustainability; training; typology; university sector; Akita; Honshu; Japan; Tohoku,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: 17K14014",,,,,,,,,,,"Kates, R.W., Clark, W.C., Corell, R., Hall, J.M., Jaeger, C.C., Lowe, I., McCarthy, J.J., Dickson, N.M., Sustainability Science (2001) Science, 292, pp. 641-642; Clark, W.C., Dickson, N.M., Sustainability science: The emerging research program (2003) Proc.

To get there, varied and complementary strategies must come into play-among them education. This trend is turning to the ""Social and Solidarity Economy"" (SSE), especially since the approval by the United Nations (UN) of the 2030 Agenda; the fulfilment of which demands adult education strategies and programs in line with the principles and values of sustainability. This article offers a response to that demand. It aims to carry out a reflective analysis that reveals the similarities between the principles and values of the SSE and those guiding the UN's 2030 Agenda, with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Based on the results of this analysis, we will argue that training in the competencies for sustainability, essential in achieving the SDGs, is among the main functions of education within the SSE framework. Further, in order to make educational programs more sustainable, such training must be included in their operating objectives. The work uses a hermeneutic methodology based on the existing literature and gives particular attention to UNESCO's directives on training in key competencies for sustainability. The significant contribution the results make is to show: (a) the emphases of each approach and their similarities; (b) how the two are complementary; and (c) the potential, and need, for creating synergies based on their respective strengths. A further original contribution is a proposed basic guide for the design of training activities geared towards gaining the normative competency that UNESCO has identified as key to sustainability. This innovative proposal will be useful for improving the quality of adult training programs, thereby contributing to the achievement of the SDGs in communities. © 2017 by the authors.",Adult education; Community development; Competencies; Social and solidarity economy; Social enterprises; Sustainable development,adult education; community development; demand analysis; international relations; methodology; national economy; socioeconomic conditions; strategic approach; sustainability; sustainable development; training; UNESCO,,,,,"Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia, UNED","Acknowledgments: The authors would like to thank the financial support from the Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia, UNED (Spain).

In handling these problems education for sustainable development (ESD) is seen as important. Different key competences that ESD should focus on have been introduced, such as the ability to deal with future dimensions. Still, studies indicate that future dimensions are not always included in ESD and that many young people are pessimistic concerning the global future. Therefore, one could argue that a focus on anticipatory emotions, especially hope, should be included in ESD. There is a worry, however, that hope will lead to unrealistic optimism and/or less engagement. The aim of this paper is to problematize the discussion about hope in relation to ESD and the global future by grounding it in theories from different disciplines and in empirical research about young people, hope, and climate change. The review shows that hope is a complex, multifaceted, and sometimes contested concept. Hope can be related to denial, but in other cases it can help people face and do something constructive with their worries about the global future. The close relation between hope and trust is emphasized and a need for critical emotional awareness in ESD is argued for. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Anticipation; Climate change; Education for sustainable development; Hope; Sustainability competences; Transformative learning; Young people,climate change; educational development; environmental education; future prospect; research work; sustainability; sustainable development; young population,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, S., The promise of happiness (2010), Duke University Press; Ainsworth, M.D.S., Attachment beyond infancy (1989) American Psychologist, 44, pp. 709-716; Amsler, S., From ‘therapeutic’ to political education: The centrality of affective sensibility in critical pedagogy (2011) Critical Studies in Education, 52 (1), pp. 47-63; Amsler, S., The education of radical democracy (2015), Routledge London & New York; Arbuthnott, K.D., Taking the long view: Environmental sustainability and delay of gratification (2010) Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy, 10, pp. 4-22; Bandura, A., Self-efficacy: The exercise of control (1997), Freeman & Company New York; Barth, M., Godemann, J., Rieckmann, M., Stoltenberg, U., Developing key competencies for sustainable development in higher education (2007) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 8 (4), pp. 416-430; Bateman, D., Teaching futures in schools (2015) Futures, 71, pp. 122-131; Beckert, J., Imagined futures. fictional expectations in the economy (2013) Theory and Society, 42, pp. 219-240; Biesta, G., Teaching, teacher education, and the humanities: Reconsidering education as a Geisteswissenschaft (2015) Educational Theory, 65 (6), pp. 665-679; Braithwaite, J., Emancipation and hope (2004) The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 592, pp. 79-98; Burton, M., Understanding mental health services: Theory and practice (1983) Critical Social Policy, 7, pp. 54-74; Byrne, J., Ideland, M., Malmberg, C., Gracea, M., Climate Change and Everyday Life: Repertoires children use to negotiate a socio-scientific issue (2014) International Journal of Science Education, 36 (9), pp. 1491-1509; Castro, P., Garrido, M., Reis, E., Menezes, J., Ambivalence and conservation behaviour: An exploratory study on the recycling of metal cans (2009) Journal of Environmental Psychology, 29, pp. 24-33; Conell, S., Fien, J., Lee, J., Sykes, H., Yencken, D., ‘If it doesńt directly affect you, you dońt think about it’: a qualitative study of young peoplés environmental attitudes in two australian cities (1999) Environmental Education Research, 5 (1), pp. 95-114; Daly, F., The zero-point: Encountering the dark emptiness of nothingness (2013) The privatization of hope: Ernst Bloch and the future of utopia, pp. 164-202. , P.

Motivation often flows from a resilience mindset - how cities can prepare for and be resilient to future shocks. The conflation of sustainability and resilience jeopardizes the success of sustainability efforts and limits their scope. Institutionalizing sustainability in city governments requires building capacity for city leadership to link sustainability and resilience objectives. This article builds on previous work in sustainability education to demonstrate how key competencies, or ways of thinking, in sustainability can be adapted for use with city leadership. The article introduces a novel board game entitled Future Shocks and City Resilience as a method for creating an interactive educational environment that facilitates learning while contributing to cultural change within a city administration. The game was played with leadership from the City of Tempe, Arizona. Results from analyzing the game play indicate that the game encourages participants to utilize sustainability in ways of thinking at a novice level. Recommendations include how cities can utilize this and other capacity-building tools to develop intermediate and advanced sustainability competence among their staffs. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",capacity building; games; resilience; scenarios; sustainability,capacity building; climate change; cultural change; ecosystem resilience; federal system; future prospect; leadership; learning; renewable resource; sustainability; Arizona; Tempe; United States,,,,,"City, University of London, City","City administration in Tempe is in terested in implementing sustain ability policies and practices and recently established a sustainability commission and hired a sustain ability manager.

Focus has thus shifted from the “why” to the “how” of CSR and, therefore, a shift in the “locus” of CSR responsibility from the “influencer” chief executive officer toward the “implementer” CSR professionals. The purpose of this paper is to study the role of management education in developing individual competencies among the implementers and impacting effective CSR implementation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper, using a case study design, studies the role of management education in developing individual competencies among the implementers and impacting effective CSR implementation. Building on theoretical frameworks, this paper carries out an exploratory research of an Indian business school’s management education program for development practitioners. It uses qualitative inputs gathered from relevant stakeholders of the program to understand the role of management education in facilitating the paradigm shift in CSR in the Indian context. Findings: The paper finds that the program has impacted outcomes at three levels, namely through developing key individual CSR-related competencies; impacting participants’ professional performance; and organizational impact in effective CSR implementation. Practical implications: The case study provides a roadmap to business schools for designing and implementing programs for CSR professionals. Originality/value: Extant research in the Indian context is silent on key competencies required for CSR implementation and also on the role of management education in developing the same. Such competencies can ensure the efficiency of the expected large CSR spends by private corporates under the new legal requirements and alter the country’s social development path. © 2017, Tulsi Jayakumar and Rukaiya Kirit Joshi.",Corporate social responsibility; India; Individual CSR competencies; Influencers vs implementers; Locus of CSR responsibility; Role of management education,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, S.K., (2008) Corporate Social Responsibility in India, , Sage, New Delhi; Agle, B.R., Caldwell, C.B., Understanding research on values in business (1999) Business and Society, 38 (3), pp. 326-387; Anand, U., (2015) India has 31 lakh NGOs, more than double the number of schools, , http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/india-has-31-lakh-ngos-twice-the-number-of-schools-almost-twice-number-of-policemen/, The Indian Express, August 1: (accessed, March 10, 2016; (2004) Ethics education in business schools, , a report of the Ethics Education Task Force to AACSB International, Tampa; Baden, D., Parkes, C., Experiential learning: inspiring the business leaders of tomorrow (2013) Journal of Management Development, 32 (3), pp. 295-308; (2013) India philanthropy report 2013, , www.dasra.org/sites/default/files/BAIN_REPORT_India_Philanthropy_Report_2013.pdf, (accessed, March 27, 2016; Balasubramanian, N.K., Kimber, D., Siemensma, F., Emerging opportunities or traditions reinforced?

Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 professors in the Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability at OU and 10 professors in the School of Sustainability at ASU. Findings: The results highlight the complexity of teaching sustainability in an interdisciplinary manner in both programs. Professors are incorporating many of the key competencies of sustainability teaching, but in a patchwork manner that does not necessary follow the comprehensive frameworks from the literature. Practical implications: The comparative analysis leads to recommendations for teaching sustainability in higher education. Originality/value: This study contributes to theories of sustainability teaching by identifying gaps between what professors are actually doing and experiencing and a set of best practices from the literature. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Interdisciplinary; Key competencies; Pedagogy; Sustainability; Team teaching,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, R.S., Speck, B.W., Oh what a difference a team makes: why team teaching makes a difference (1998) Teaching and Teacher Education, 14 (7), pp. 671-686; (2015) Academic programs in sustainability and sustainability course inventories, , www.aashe.org/, (accessed, November 2014; Ban, N.C., Boyd, E., Cox, M., Meek, C.L., Schoon, M., Villamayor-Tomas, S., Linking classroom learning and research to advance ideas about social-ecological resilience (2015) Ecology and Society, 20 (3), p. 35; Barriball, K.L., While, A., Collecting data using a semi-structured interview: a discussion paper (1994) Journal of Advanced Nursing, 19 (2), pp. 328-335; Barth, M., Michelsen, G., Learning for change: an educational contribution to sustainability science (2013) Sustainability Science, 8 (1), pp. 103-119; Benn, S., Dunphy, D., Action research as an approach to integrating sustainability into MBA programs (2009) Journal of Management Education, 33 (3), pp. 276-295; Brundiers, K., Wiek, A., Educating students in real-world sustainability research: vision and implementation (2011) Innovative Higher Education, 36 (2), pp. 107-124; Brundiers, K., Wiek, A., Do we teach what we preach?

The problem is twofold: the first difficulty is the relationship to the general issues regarding competence and its assessment; the second difficulty is the assessment of competencies in cross-curricular education in diverse contexts such as school and work. Design/methodology/approach: – The European key competence for lifelong learning of the sense of initiative and entrepreneurship and the European qualification framework (EQF) are convenient to benchmark the outcomes of enterprise education. In order to assess and develop competence in vocational students, educators should design real life problem solving situations, which are new for the students and closely related to their vocations. Findings: – The study describes an assessment process of the learning outcomes in terms of knowledge, skills and competence. While the authors tested knowledge by giving the students open-ended questions, the authors assessed the skills and competence with a practical problem concerning the students’ vocational discipline to be solved in groups. Research limitations/implications: – The paper calls for a better alignment between work experience, teaching for competence and assessment of key competences – such as the sense of initiative and entrepreneurship – taught as a cross curricular subject. Originality/value: – The assessment makes use of a theoretically grounded definition of competence, and considers varied forms of evaluation of entrepreneurship education. Educators can use it across Europe as it refers to a common background, the European key competences and the EQF, and it promotes the students’ transitions to work and mobility. It is rigorous, and, at the same time, adaptable to the context.

The importance of bringing university students closer to stakeholders in society as part of their learning process is high regarding sustainable agriculture, because of its applied approach. University programs based on experiential and action-oriented learning have been developed over the past decades, but more knowledge is needed about the impact of these educational activities. In a short course in sustainable agriculture at the University of Gastronomic Sciences in Bra, Italy, we examined the impacts of experiential and action-oriented learning on competency development as well as transformational impacts on the students. We found that students improve on several core competences as a result of their participation in the short course, and also signs of deep transformational processes among the students. © 2016 by the author.",Action learning; Competence-based education; Experiential learning; Self-assessment; Sustainable agriculture; Transformation,academic research; alternative agriculture; education policy; environmental education; learning; stakeholder; student; university sector,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dewey, J., (2005) Art as Experience, , Penguin Books: London, UK; Kolb, D., (1984) Experiential Learning: Experience as the Source of Learning and Development, , Prentice-Hall Publishing: Englewood Cliffs, NJ, USA; Dolci, D., (1988) Dal Trasmettere al Comunicare, , Sonda Edizioni: Casale Monferrato (Al), Italy.

Carbon Footprinting. -. into the Information Systems undergraduate curriculum within an educational setting of problem-based and project-based learning. Embedding Green Information Systems theory and practice into the coursework of students majoring in Information Systems and Computer Science brings an interdisciplinary advantage to the 'wicked problem' of sustainability. The unique contribution of this paper is that it explores how reflective practice enables students to become more aware and empowered through exposure to real-world problems, such as Carbon Footprinting. The theoretical framework is based on the 'Shu ha ri' model proposed by Cockburn [1] as well as the Green Information Systems framework by Butler [2] and the paper aims to extend the institutional influences of Green IS to include a collaborative element.

However, evaluation instruments are often limited, for example to single student competencies or specific elements of the teaching process. The present paper provides a more comprehensive evaluation concept that contributes to sustainable improvement of competence-based teaching in higher education institutions. The evaluation concept considers competence research developments as well as the participatory evaluation approach. The evaluation concept consists of three stages. The first stage evaluates whether the competencies students are supposed to acquire within the curriculum (ideal situation) are well defined. The second stage evaluates the teaching process and the competencies students have actually acquired (real situation). The third stage evaluates concrete aspects of the teaching process. Additionally, an implementation strategy is introduced to support the transfer from the theoretical evaluation concept to practice. The evaluation concept and its implementation strategy are designed for internal evaluations in higher education and primarily address higher education institutions that have already developed and conducted a competence-based curriculum. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Competence-based teaching; Higher education; Implementation; Participatory evaluation; Quality management,"curriculum; European Union; higher education; participatory approach; quality control; teaching; Europe; academic achievement; consumer; curriculum; educational model; European Union; evaluation study; human; procedures; standards; student; teaching; university; Competency-Based Education; Consumer Participation; Curriculum; Education, Graduate; European Union; Faculty; Humans; Models, Educational; Students; Teaching",,,,,"86145, 86145-1; Volkswagen Foundation; Stiftung Mercator","This research was financially facilitated by “ KELDAT – Kompetenzzentrum für E-Learning, Didaktik und Ausbildungsforschung der Tiermedizin ” (nos. 86145 and 86145-1 ) [Competence center for e-learning, didactics, and educational research in veterinary medicine], a project funded by Stiftung Mercator and the Volkswagen foundation.

University sustainability programs intend to provide integrated education that fosters the key competencies students need to solve real-world sustainability problems. Translating sustainability competencies into effective pedagogical practice in integrated academic programs is not straightforward. This work builds on a previous study by both expanding the competencies evaluated and considering additional demographic characteristics. Design/methodology/approach – The paper summarizes previously identified key sustainability competencies and describes teaching methodologies used to foster these competencies in students. Development of competencies in students during a semester-long course is assessed using a pre-/ post-test based on two case studies. The implications of the findings for teaching practice and overall program structure are discussed. Findings – Based on the assessment methods used here, four of the five sustainability competencies evaluated in this study developed differently in students according to gender, disciplinary affiliation and age. Females improved interpersonal competence more than males. Systems thinking competence improved for students associated with the three disciplinary affiliations considered in this study: sustainability major, sustainability minor and business major. Anticipatory competence improved for sustainability and business majors only, but not for students minoring in sustainability and majoring in other disciplines. Finally, normative competence improved for younger students only. Research limitations/implications – Insights for teaching practice and overall program structure are based on assessment of one introductory transdisciplinary sustainability course. Much additional work is needed to draw strong conclusions about general teaching practices and program structure for sustainability education. This study provides a flexible and field-tested rubric for further evaluative work in other sustainability courses or degree programs. Practical implications – Universities incorporate sustainability into their undergraduate curricula in many ways, ranging from certificates to entire degree programs focused on sustainability. The results of this study suggest that educators pay attention to gender diversity, classroom teaching practices, disciplinary perspectives and student attitudes and developmental stages as they figure out how to make sustainability part of undergraduate education. This information may help create more effective sustainability courses and academic programs, which may maintain the viability of current sustainability programs and promote the institutionalization of sustainability in higher education. Originality/value – This research contributes to undergraduate sustainability education by providing insight into how sustainability education might thoughtfully be integrated into academic programs. It also offers an assessment approach for use by other sustainability educators to evaluate effectiveness of teaching practice and overall program structure based on five key sustainability competencies commonly cited in the literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Assessment; Curriculum development; Sustainability competencies; Sustainability education; Transdisciplinary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2008) Toward a Sustainable Future: The Role of Student Affairs in Creating Healthy Environments, Social Justice, and Strong Economies, , www.myacpa.org/sites/default/files/ACPA_Sustainability_Monograph.pdf, accessed 24 January 2014; Anderson, R., (1998) Mid-Course Correction: Toward a Sustainable Enterprise: The Interface Model, , Peregrinzilla Press, Atlanta, GA; Anderson, R., (2009) The Business Logic of Sustainability, , www.ted.com/talks/ray_anderson_on_the_business_logic_of_sustainability.html?quote_487, Long Beach, CA; (2011) Bachelor’s Degree Programs in Sustainability, , www.aashe.org/resources/bachelors-degree-programs-sustainability, Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE), AASHE, Denver, CO; Barnes, L.B., Christensen, C.R., Hansen, A.J., (1994) Teaching and the Case Method, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, MA; Bass, B., (1990) Bass & Stogdill’s Handbook of Leadership: Theory, Research, & Managerial Applications, , 3rd ed., Free Press, New York, NY; Batten, M., Collins, C., Withers, G., Ainley, J.G., (1998) Schools and the Social Development of Young Australians, , Camberwell, Victoria; Belenky, M.F., Clinchy, B.M., Goldberger, N.R., Tarule, J.M., (1986) Women’s Ways of Knowing: The Development of Self, Voice, and Mind, , New York, NY; Benson, T.A., Developing a systems thinking capacity in learners of all ages (2007) Systems Thinking in Schools Program, , www.watersfoundation.org/webed/library/articles/Developing-ST-capacity.pdf, Waters Foundation, Pittsburgh, PA, accessed 31 January 2014; Blum, K.D., (1999) Asynchronous, Computer-Mediated Communication (Cmc)-Based Higher Education at a Distance: Gender Differences in Preferred Learning Styles, Participation Barriers, and Communication Patterns, , PhD dissertation, Walden University, Minneapolis, MN; Boulding, E., Images and action in peace building (1988) Journal of Social Issues, 44 (2), pp. 17-37; Bradfield, R., Wright, G., Burt, G., Cairns, G., Van Der Heijen, K., The origins and evolution of scenario techniques in long range business planning (2005) Futures, 37, pp. 795-812; Bransford, J.D., Brown, A.L., Cocking, R.R., (2000) How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School, , National Academy Press, Washington, DC; Bruffee, K., (1993) Collaborative Learning: Higher Education, Interdependence, and the Authority of Knowledge, , John Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD; Brundiers, K., Wiek, A., Educating students in real-world sustainability research: Vision and implementation (2011) Innovative Higher Education, 36, pp. 107-124; Brundiers, K., Wiek, A., Do we teach what we preach?

The goal of this case study was to describe the useful of the competence-based curriculum design to increase the actual stock of knowledge toward achieving curriculum greening. This bachelor’s degree has been designed with the primary purpose of boosting the supply of educational services in the country in order to not only meet the rights of all Mexicans citizens to obtain a higher education, but also to confront the sustainability challenges within the UNESCO key campaigns such as the Decade of Education for Sustainable Development, Education for all and the Millennium Development Goals (EAMG). Having as the organizing principle the competency-based framework, the sustainability bachelor’s degree project was carried out using the focus group research technique for collecting data. The concept of competence has played a key role in defining the outcomes of this curriculum; yet, there are a number of ongoing issues that are significant enough in order to address the challenges imposed by this decade that have not been included because it is impossible to cover all aspects of sustainable development. Hopefully, the sustainability graduate students will have the competences for being the most effective agent of change to foster sustainability in organizations. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Curriculum; DESD; Distance learning; EDS; Sustainability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ally, M., Samaka, M., Open education resources and mobile technology to narrow the learning divide (2013) The International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 14 (2), pp. 15-27; Almers, E., Pathways to action competence for sustainability—Six themes (2013) The Journal of Environmental Education, 44 (2), pp. 116-127; Boesen, J., Helenius, O., Bergqvist, E., Bergqvist, T., Lithner, J., Palm, T., Palmberg, B., Developing mathematical competence: From the intended to the enacted curriculum (2014) The Journal of Mathematics Behavior, 33, pp. 72-87; Chomsky, N., (1965) Aspects of the theory of syntax, , MIT Press, Cambridge, M; Dabrowski, M., Wisniewski, J., Translating Key Competences into the School Curriculum: Lessons from the Polish experience (2011) European Journal of Education, 46 (3), pp. 323-334; Delakowitz, B., Anke, H., The Hochschule Zittau/Gorlitz: Germany’s first registered environmental management (EMAS) at an institution of higher education (2000) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 1 (1), p. 41; Delong, D., McDermott, M., Current perceptions, prominence and prevalence of sustainability in the marketing curriculum (2013) Marketing Management Journal, 23 (2), pp. 101-116; Desha, C., Hargroves, K., Smith, M., Addressing the time lag dilemma in curriculum renewal towards engineering education for sustainable development (2009) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 10 (2), pp. 184-199; Faberberg, J., Landström, H., Martin, B., Exploring the emerging knowledge base of ‘the knowledge society’ (2012) Research Policy, 41 (7), pp. 1121-1131; Fichman, R., Dos Santos, B., Zheng, Z., Digital innovation as a fundamental and powerful concept in the information systems curriculum (2014) MIS Quarterly, 38 (2), pp. 329-353; Glassey, J., Haile, S., Sustainability in chemical engineering curriculum (2012) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 13 (4), pp. 354-364; Gonglewski, M., Helm, A., LaissezFair: A Case for Greening the Business German Curriculum (2013) Teaching German, 46 (2), pp. 200-214; http://www.snieg.mx/contenidos/espanol/normatividad/MarcoJuridico/PND_2013-2018.pdf, Gobierno de la República.

Part of this competence in sustainability is anticipatory competence, the ability to engage with multiple futures, manage uncertainty and hold a worldview that the future can and should be steered toward a more just sustainable path. In order to further examine and operationalise anticipatory competence, a course ""Sustainability and the Future"" was developed and run in the University of Vechta, Germany, as part of an action research cycle exploring key competencies for sustainability in higher education. Reflective journaling was used to explore the competence acquisition process along with focus groups with students after the course. The analysis of this programme shows that while certain subject areas such as values, transport and population models provoke more critical reflection on the future, skills such as the ability to work with emotional aspects of the future, for instance hope, were perceived to be necessary for anticipatory competence. © 2015 by the authors.",Anticipatory competence; Education for sustainable development; Higher education; Reflective learning; Sustainability competence,data acquisition; future prospect; higher education; learning; population modeling; student; sustainability; sustainable development; teaching; university sector; Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rockström, J., Steffen, W., Noone, K., Persson, Å., Chapin, F.S., III, Lambin, E., Lenton, T.M., Schellnhuber;, H., Planetary boundaries: exploring the safe operating space for humanity (2009) Ecol.

Their remit is to promote the required competencies to achieve that aim, including competencies in sustainability. This article describes the role that the universities in Spain are fulfilling with respect to these issues and presents a training proposal that comprises four key competencies in sustainability with their corresponding performance indicators that permit the evaluation of different levels of achievement in training processes. These competencies must embrace their formative role not only with regard to future graduates who will be employed in ""green jobs"" per se, but also with regard to those alumni who will work in all the other productive sectors, in addition to all citizens directly and indirectly involved in the wider economy as consumers, producers and (direct or indirect) recipients of its effects. The proposal is based on the recommendations of the Conferencia de Rectores de Universidades Españolas (CRUE: Conference of Chancellors of Spanish Universities), and can be adapted to the teaching programs of different subjects in order to facilitate the training necessary in general competencies of sustainability within the ambit of the subjects taught. Furthermore, this proposal follows the institutional strategy of CRUE to promote curricula sustainability through the inclusion of the principles and values of sustainable development in every degree and educational program taught. This proposal could also be applied to other cultural contexts with similar characteristics. © 2014 by the authors.",Competencies in sustainability; Curricular sustainability; Education for sustainable development; Green competencies; Green economy; Higher education; Learning; Spain; Sustainable economy,educational development; environmental indicator; sustainable development; training; Spain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Report of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (2012), http://www.uncsd2012.org/content/documents/814UNCSD%20REPORT%20final%20revs.pdf, UN, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 20-22 June, A/CONF.216/16.

Drawing on New Institutional Sociology, the present work aims to identify and improve knowledge concerning the factors which are hindering that change in the Spanish university system. This is investigated using a case study based on a Spanish university which is a pioneer in the implementation of a competence-based curriculum. The results show that factors identified and analysed are conditioning the change and causing a ceremonial adoption of the competence-based system by the teaching staff. The results of the study may be of use as a reference and orientation for educators and administrators as well as for the regulators of those countries integrated within the EHEA. The study may prove useful in the analysis of inertia factors present when designing and implementing the policies and measures necessary to achieve a comprehensive teaching methodology; one which incorporates learning and assessment of competences in a real manner. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",competences; European higher education area; institutional theory; Spanish higher education; teaching methodologies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(1990) Objectives of education for accountants (Position Statement No. 1), , Accounting Education Change Commission (AECC), New York, NY,: AECC; Albrecht, W.S., Sack, R., (2000) Accounting education: Charting the course through a perilous future, , Sarasota, FL,: American Accounting Association,.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper summarizes three previously identified key sustainability competencies and describes teaching methodologies used in the introductory course described here to foster these competencies in students. The development of these competencies over the course of one semester is assessed using a pre-/post-test based on case analyses. The implications of these findings for academic sustainability programs are discussed. Findings: Based on the assessment used here, the sustainability competencies developed differently in students with different disciplinary affiliations as a result of the introductory sustainability course. Business majors did not improve any of the key competencies, sustainability majors improved systems thinking competence only, and sustainability minors who were majoring in another traditional discipline improved all competencies. Originality/value: The paper contributes to undergraduate sustainability education by shedding light on how sustainability might best be incorporated into specific academic programs. This information may help create more effective sustainability courses and academic programs, which may maintain the viability of current sustainability programs and promote the institutionalization of sustainability in higher education in general. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Assessment; Interdisciplinarity; Sustainability competencies; Sustainability education; Transdisciplinary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2011) Bachelor's degree programs in sustainability, , www.aashe.org/resources/bachelors-degree-programs-sustainability, available at, (accessed 29 November 2011),AASHE; (2008) Toward a Sustainable Future, , http://louisville.edu/student/about/ACPASustainabilityMonograph.pdf, American College Personnel Association, available at, (accessed 29 November 2011),ACPA; Adler, M., Flihan, S., (1997) The Interdisciplinary Continuum: Reconciling Theory, Research, and Practice, , National Research Center on English Learning and Achievement, Albany, NY; Armstrong, C., (2011) The journey toward the integration of sustainability in apparel and textiles education: A case study, , PhD dissertation; Barnes, L.B., Christensen, C.R., Hansen, A.J., (1994) Teaching and the Case Method, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, MA; Baron, J., (2000) Thinking and Deciding, , Cambridge University Press, New York, NY; Beatley, T., The many meanings of sustainability: Introduction to a special issue of JPL (1995) Journal of Planning Literature, 9 (4), pp. 339-342; Becher, T., (1989) Academic Tribes and Territories: Intellectual Enquiry and the Cultures of Disciplines, , Open University Press, Milton Keynes; Bell, S., Morse, S., (2008) Sustainability Indicators: Measuring the Immeasurable?, , Earthscan, London, 2nd ed; Bloom, B.S., Engelhart, M.D., Hill, W.H., Frust, E.J., Krathwohl, D.R., (1956) Taxonomy of Education Objectives, , David McKay, New York, NY; Boix Mansilla, V., Assessing student work at disciplinary crossroads (2005) Change Magazine, 37 (1), pp. 14-21; Boix Mansilla, V., Duraising, E.D., Targeted assessment of students' interdisciplinary work: An empirically grounded framework proposed (2007) The Journal of Higher Education, 78 (2), pp. 215-237; Brandes, G.M., Seixas, P., So that the two can mix in this crucible: Teachers in an interdisciplinary school-university collaboration in the humanities (2000) Interdisciplinary Curriculum: Challenges to Implementation, pp. 134-152. , Wineburg, S., Grossman, P.

The consequence is that almost everything we do may be said to contain weak attributes of ESD even if we know nothing significant about it. This paper attempts to reveal an understanding of ESD that is informed by an exploration of policy language and agenda and recent literature in the field. The exploration of policy reveals the possible cause for previous inadequate implementation of ESD. An exploration of policy and literature reveals some key competencies that are advocated for through ESD. Insight into how policy has shifted from an ecological to a development focus and substantiation for why this shift is important in addressing current sustainable development issues serves to inform the interpretation of ESD. Finally, the analysis of policy and literature is triangulated to develop a framework that may assist ESD stakeholders in identifying ESD competencies in policy and practice. It is hoped that through this engagement with selected texts a more informed and complex insight into ESD and its features may be developed.","Competencies,action competence; Education for sustainable development; Sustainability literacy; Sustainable development",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Barsan, G., Nastasescu, V., Barsan, V., Education for sustainability implementation in knowledge-based organizations (2011) Revista Academei Fortelor Terestre, 3 (63), pp. 283-286. , Academic Land Forces Magazine; Brundtland, G.H., (1987) 8th Meeting of the World Commission on Environment and Development, Tokyo, Japan., , http://www.regjeringen.no/upload/SMK/Vedlegg/ Taler%20og%20artikler%20av%20tidligere%20statsministre/ Gro%20Harlem%20Brundtland/1987/Address_at_Eighth_WCED_Meeting.pdf, February 27, January 17, 2014; Connors, R.D., Dovers, S., (2002) Institutional Change and Learning for Sustainable Development, , Melbourne: Edward Elgar Publishers; (1994) CRE Copernicus Charter: The University Charter for Sustainable Development, , http://www.iisd.org/educate/declare.htm, Copernicus [CO-operation Programme in Europe for Research on Nature and Industry through Coordinated University Studies], Retrieved November 21, 2013; De Haan, G., Bormann, I., Leicht, A., Introduction: The midway point of the un Decade of Education for Sustainable Development: Current research and practice in ESD (2010) International Revolutionary Education, 56, pp. 199-206; Gadotti, M., ESD and education for all: Synergies and potential conflicts (2010) International Review of Education, 56, pp. 221-234; Hellesnes, J., (1976) Socialisering Og Teknokrati [Socialisation and Technocracy], , Oslo: Gyldendal; Hopkins, C.A., McKeown, R., Education for sustainable development (1999) Forum for Applied Research and Public Policy, 14, pp. 1-2; Huckle, J., (2001) Education for Sustainable Development: Some Guidelines for Curriculum Reform, , http://john.huckle.org.uk/publications_downloads.jsp, September 27, 2012; Huckle, J., Consulting the UK ESD community on an ESD indicator to recommend to government: An insight into the micro-politics of ESD (2009) Environmental Education Research, 15 (1), pp. 1-16; (2000) The Earth Charter, , http://www.earthcharter.org, IECC (Independent Earth Charter Commission), April 6, 2013; Jickling, B., Why i don't want my children to be educated for sustainable development: Sustainable belief (1994) Trumpeter, 11 (3), pp. 1-8; Jickling, B., Wals, A.E., Debating education for sustainable development 20 years after Rio: A conversation between Bob Jickling and Arjen Wals (2012) Journal of Education for Sustainable Development, 6 (1), pp. 49-57; Malherbe, B., (2010) The Great Run.

The quality of these methods needs to be assured using adapted quality criteria and accompanying standards. As such standards are not widely available, this study sets out to examine what level of compliance with quality criteria stakeholders consider satisfactory. Two professional education programmes specified the implicit standards they applied in a self-evaluation procedure designed to evaluate the quality of their Competence Assessment Programs (CAPs). They specified similar cut-off scores, but different descriptive standards. Analysis revealed that this was due to theIR experience with competence-based education and the quality of their own CAP, but influences of the selected method and the understanding of the quality criteria were also found. As such, the specified standards are local, but meaningful for the programmes' quality assurance. Implications for self-evaluation and standard-setting procedures are discussed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",assessment; quality assurance; self-evaluation; standards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Akkerman, S., Admiraal, W., Brekelmans, M., Oost, H., Auditing quality of research in social sciences (2008) Quality and Quantity, 42 (2), pp. 257-274; Allen, D., Tanner, K., Rubrics: Tools for making learning goals and evaluation criteria explicit for both teachers and learners (2006) CBE Life Science Education, 5 (3), pp. 197-203; Baartman, L.K.J., Bastiaens, T.J., Kirschner, P.A., van der Vleuten, C.P.M., The wheel of competency assessment: Presenting quality criteria for competency assessment programs (2006) Studies in Educational Evaluation, 32 (2), pp. 153-170; Baartman, L.K.J., Prins, F.J., Kirschner, P.A., van der Vleuten, C.P.M., Determining the quality of competence assessment programs: A self-evaluation procedure (2007) Studies in Educational Evaluation, 33 (3-4), pp. 258-281; Baartman, L.K.J., Prins, F.J., Kirschner, P.A., van der Vleuten, C.P.M., Self-evaluation of assessment programs: A cross-case analysis (2011) Evaluation and Program Planning, 34 (3), pp. 206-216; Bennett, Y., The validity and reliability of assessments and self-assessments of work-based learning (1993) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 18 (2), pp. 83-95; Berk, R.A., Standard setting: the next generation (where few psychometricians have gone before!)

The suggested approach was designed and tested within a project implemented in Austria, the UK, Slovenia and Romania. Evidence from this multi-country study of employers and business graduates suggests that it is possible to investigate industry requirements with a cluster of eight key generic competencies. Competencies were selected following a detailed analysis of academic literature and 39 semi-structured qualitative interviews. A survey was conducted with 900 business graduates and employers in four European countries. The survey confirmed that the eight key competencies selected were both valuable for business graduates' current job performance as well as relevant for future career development. Survey results showed that employers were not very confident in the level of capability of business graduates in the eight competencies investigated in this study. Results are consistent with other empirical evidence concerned with graduates' level of key generic skills and highlight the need to strengthen competency development within undergraduate business education. Implications for future research and curriculum improvement are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Competency assessment; Industry requirements; Leadership development; Undergraduate business education,,,,,,"European Commission, EC",The authors would like to thank the European Commission (Leonardo Da Vinci Programme) for the financial grant and technical assistance provided for the design and implementation of this project.,,,,,,,,,,"(2007) AACSB assurance of learning standards: An interpretation, , http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/papers/AOLPaper-final-11-20-07.pdf, Retrieved on January 25, 2012, from, AACSB; Aamodt, P.O., Havnes, A., Factors affecting professional job mastery: quality of study or work experience?

During the last years, many universities have undertaken activities for implementing Higher Education for Sustainable Development (HESD). Many have asked which key competencies are most relevant for sustainable development and hence should be developed in future-oriented higher education. Different approaches for the selection of sustainability key competencies have been developed, but there is little international agreement in the debate around the most important key competencies. Consequently, this paper asks which individual key competencies are crucial for understanding central challenges facing the world society and for facilitating its development towards a more sustainable future, and thus identifies those competencies which should be fostered through university teaching and learning. The empirical design of the study is related to a Delphi study in which 'sustainability key competencies' are defined by selected experts from Europe (Germany, Great Britain) and Latin America (Chile, Ecuador, Mexico). The results show that twelve key competencies crucial for sustainable development can be identified; the most relevant ones are those for systemic thinking, anticipatory thinking and critical thinking. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Delphi study; Europe; Future of higher education; Higher Education for Sustainable Development; Key competencies; Latin America,empirical analysis; higher education; learning; sustainable development; teaching; university sector; Europe; Latin America,,,,,Heinrich Böll Stiftung,The study was carried out as part of a doctoral thesis and was made possible by a doctoral scholarship from the Heinrich Böll Foundation.,,,,,,,,,,"Harris, G., (2007) Seeking Sustainability in an Age of Complexity, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; (1996), WBGU (German Advisory Council on Global Change), World in Transition: The Research Challenge.

Furthermore ""sustainability competence"" as a potential outcome of such interaction is to be introduced, referring to the capacities and qualities that people, and the organizations and communities of which they are part, need in order to address (un)sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: The argument of the paper is grounded conceptually in emergent thinking among scholars preoccupied with learning-based change and sustainability in organizations and communities. Empirically, the paper uses two case studies carried out by the authors to ground the argument in real efforts by communities to create a (more) sustainable way of living. Findings: The main results include: a post-normal understanding of sustainability highlighting uncertainty, complexity, normativity, controversy and indeterminacy; a framework facilitating dialogic interaction; and a number of key competences that appear conducive to both dialogic interaction and a transition to sustainability. Research limitations/implications: Although the two case studies are quite extensive and rigorous, the conceptual nature of the paper and the word limitation did not allow for a more detailed discussion of the methodology used in the case studies and the contexts in which the two case studies are located. Originality/value: The paper adopts a post-normal perspective of organizational transitions towards sustainability and focuses on dialogue and dialogic interaction as a key learning-based mechanism for facilitating such a transition. Furthermore the framework for dialogic interaction allows for a more holistic approach toward such a transition and the development of competences needed to accelerate its realization. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Change management; Dialogic interaction; Learning systems; Post-normal science; Society; Sustainability competence; Sustainable development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baraldi, C., New forms of intercultural communication in a globalized world (2006) The International Communication Gazette, 68, pp. 53-69; Barth, M., Godemann, J., Rieckman, M., Stoltenberg, U., Developing key competences for sustainable development in higher education (2007) International Journal Sustainability Higher Education, 8 (4), pp. 416-430; Barth, M., Godemann, J., Rieckman, M., Stoltenberg, U., Developing key competences for sustainable development in higher education (2007) International Journal Sustainability Higher Education, 8 (4), pp. 416-430; Beck, U., (1992) Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity, , Sage Publications, New Delhi; Beck, U., (2008) World at Risk, , Polity Press, Cambridge; Berlyne, D.E., Curiosity and education (1965) Learning and the Educational Process, pp. 67-87. , Krumbolts, J.D.

The outcomes of the self-evaluations of two schools are systematically compared: a novice school with little experience in competence-based education and assessment, and an innovative school with extensive experience. The self-evaluation was based on 12 quality criteria for CAPs, including both validity and reliability, and criteria stressing the importance of the formative function of assessment, such as meaningfulness and educational consequences. In each school, teachers, management and examination board participated. Results show that the two schools use different approaches to assure assessment quality. The innovative school seems to be more aware of its own strengths and weaknesses, to have a more positive attitude towards teachers, students, and educational innovations, and to explicitly involve stakeholders (i.e., teachers, students, and the work field) in their assessments. This school also had a more explicit vision of the goal of competence-based education and could design its assessments in accordance with these goals. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Assessment; Case study; Self-evaluation; Validity,assessment method; education; innovation; methodology; qualitative analysis; reliability analysis; student; teaching; article; curriculum; human; instrumentation; methodology; Netherlands; professional competence; psychometry; qualitative research; questionnaire; reproducibility; self evaluation; teaching; validation study; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Curriculum; Humans; Netherlands; Professional Competence; Psychometrics; Qualitative Research; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results; Self-Assessment,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO: PROO 411-02-363; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO",This research was supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) under project number PROO 411-02-363.,,,,,,,,,,"Akkerman, S., Admiraal, W., Brekelmans, M., Oost, H., Auditing quality of research in social sciences (2008) Quality & Quantity, 42, pp. 257-274; Baartman, L.K.J., Bastiaens, T.J., Kirschner, P.A., van der Vleuten, C.P.M., The wheel of competency assessment.

For more than a decade, sustainability courses have been developed and taught in higher education, yet comprehensive academic programs in sustainability, on the undergraduate and graduate level, have emerged only over the last few years. Considering this recent institutional momentum, the time is seemingly right to synthesize the discussion about key competencies in sustainability in order to support these relatively young academic programs in shaping their profiles and achieving their ambitious missions. This article presents the results of a broad literature review. The review identifies the relevant literature on key competencies in sustainability; synthesizes the substantive contributions in a coherent framework of sustainability research and problem-solving competence; and addresses critical gaps in the conceptualization of key competencies in sustainability. Insights from this study lay the groundwork for institutional advancements in designing and revising academic programs; teaching and learning evaluations; as well as hiring and training faculty and staff. © 2011 Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science, United Nations University, and Springer.",Curriculum development; Education for sustainable development; Sustainability expertise; Sustainability professional; Transformative learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baartman, L.K.J., Bastiaens, T.J., Kirschner, P.A., van der Vleuten, C.P.M., Evaluation assessment quality in competence-based education: a qualitative comparison of two frameworks (2007) Educ Res Rev, 2, pp. 114-129; Bäckstrand, K., Civic science for sustainability: reframing the role of experts, policy-makers and citizens in environmental governance (2003) Glob Environ Polit, 3 (4), pp. 24-41; Bammer, G., (2005) Integration and implementation sciences: Building a new specialization, , Ecol and Soc 10: article 6; Barth, M., Godemann, J., Rieckman, M., Stoltenberg, U., Developing key competences for sustainable development in higher education (2007) Int J Sust Higher Educ, 8 (4), pp. 416-430; Blackstock, K.L., Carter, C.E., Operationalising sustainability science for a sustainability directive?

VET assessment is, therefore, designed to determine the extent to which a trainee has effectively acquired the knowledge, skills, and competencies required by employers. Across a range of occupations, such testing has traditionally comprised a portfolio of practical on-the-job assessments, oral tests and laboratory tasks. In recent years vocational training assessment has increasingly adopted new computer-based assessment (CBA) methods and, as a consequence, consideration of the scope of computer-based assessments and their appropriateness for vocational training evaluation is timely. This paper examines the growing adoption of CBA within the safety-critical field of maritime education and training (MET), particularly, in relation to the summative assessment of seafarers for licensing purposes. It discusses the implications for validity, reliability and security. © 2011 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.",Competence-based training; Computer-based assessment; Maritime education and training; Seafarer licence examinations; Summative assessment; Vocational education and training,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baartman, L.K.J., Bstiaens, T.J., Kirschner, P.A., Vleuten, C.P.M.V.D., Evaluating assessment quality in competence-based education: A qualitative comparison of two frameworks (2007) Educational Research Review, 2, pp. 114-129; (2005) Manpower Update: The World-wide Demand For and Supply of Seafarers.

These key competencies may be most fully developed in new teaching and learning situations. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the kind of, and extent to which, these key competencies can be acquired in realworld learning opportunities. Design/methodology/approach – The paper summarizes key competencies in sustainability, identifies criteria for realworld learning opportunities in sustainability programs, and draws on dominant realworld learning models including project and problembased learning, service learning, and internships in communities, businesses, and governments. These components are integrated into a framework to design realworld learning opportunities. Findings – A “functional and progressive” model of realworld learning opportunities seems most conducive to introduce students (as well as faculty and community partners) to collaborative research between academic researchers and practitioners. The stepwise process combined with additional principles allows building competencies such as problem solving, linking knowledge to action, and collaborative work, while applying concepts and methods from the field of sustainability. Practical implications – The paper offers examples of realworld learning opportunities at the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University, discusses general challenges of implementation and organizational learning, and draws attention to critical success factors such as collaborative design, coordination, and integration in general introductory courses for undergraduate students. Originality/value – The paper contributes to sustainability education by clarifying how realworld learning opportunities contribute to the acquisition of key competencies in sustainability. It proposes a functional and progressive model to be integrated into the (undergraduate) curriculum and suggests strategies for its implementation. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Competences; Curricula; Experiential learning; Higher education; Problem solving; Sustainable development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aikenhead, G.S., (2006) Science Education for Everyday Life: Evidence-based Practice, , Teachers College Press, New York, NY; Arima, A., A plea for more education for sustainable development (2009) Sustainability Science, 4 (1), pp. 3-5; Bäckstrand, K., Civic science for sustainability: reframing the role of experts, policy-makers and citizens in environmental governance (2003) Global Environmental Politics, 3 (4), pp. 24-41; Bammer, G., Integration and implementation sciences: building a new specialization (2005) Ecology and Society, 10 (2), p. 6; Barron, B.J., Schwartz, D.L., Vye, N.J., Moore, A., Petrosino, A., Zech, L., Bransford, J.D., Doing with understanding: lessons from research on problem- and project-based learning (1998) Journal of Learning Sciences, 7 (3-4), pp. 271-311; Barth, M., Godemann, J., Rieckman, M., Stoltenberg, U., Developing key competences for sustainable development in higher education (2007) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 8 (4), pp. 416-430; Biggs, J., What the student does: teaching for enhanced learning (1999) Higher Education Research & Development, 18 (1), pp. 57-75; Blackstock, K.L., Carter, C.E., Operationalising sustainability science for a sustainability directive?

Design/methodology/approach - In this explorative and qualitative study individual interviews with representatives of study programs from eight universities in the Netherlands were held, and a participative case-study in one university was conducted, in which practices and perceptions from various stakeholder groups were triangulated. Findings - The opinions of the respondents on the usefulness of the competence-based education approach were quite positive. There is wide agreement on the necessity to align university curricula to the needs of society and of the labour market. University education can make effective use of the competence concept. Universities differ as to the extent to which they employ a competence-based education approach. Many hurdles exist for actually implementing this in university curricula. Research limitations/implications - Interpretations largely depend on the perceptions of the respondents in the study. For most university programs only one representative was included as respondent in the study. Practical implications - With some exceptions, the competence-based education approach is currently not much used in academic education. Possibilities and limitations of competence-based academic education should be identified in further case studies and strategies for actually implementing it should be developed. Further research should show differential relationships between the level of integration of the competence concept in higher education and the societal effects of the respective programs. Originality/value - The competence concept has been underexposed in university education practices and in research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Case studies; Curricula; Education; Higher education; Labour market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bartram, D., The great eight competencies: A criterion-centric approach to validation (2005) Journal of Applied Psychology, 90 (6), pp. 1185-1203; Biemans, H., Nieuwenhuis, L., Poell, R., Mulder, M., Wesselink, R., Competence-based VET in The Netherlands: Backgrounds and pitfalls (2004) Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 56 (4), pp. 523-538; Birenbaum, M., Breuer, K., Cascallar, E., Dochy, F., Dori, Y., Ridgeway, J., A learning integrated assessment system (2006) Educational Research Review, 1, pp. 61-69; Boyatzis, R.E., (1982) The Competent Manager: A Model For Effective Performance, , Wiley, New York, NY; (2005) Towards a European Qualification Framework For Lifelong Learning, , European Commission, Commission Staff Working Document, 8.7.2005 SEC (2005) 957, Commission of the European Communities, Brussels; (2006) Key Competences For Lifelong Learning.

Taking Germany as an example, this article examines whether the introduction of a two-tier degree structure actually has led to an enhanced acquisition of key competencies. Based on constructivist learning theories, in addition, the article tests the hypothesis that an activating learning environment enhances the acquisition of both disciplinary and key competencies. Data are used from a survey among higher education graduates from 2005. The results of linear regression analyses suggest that the new bachelor programmes provide better conditions for developing key competencies, and also indicate what the ingredients of a competence-oriented teaching approach might be. © 2009 Society for Research into Higher Education.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Achatz, M., Tippelt, R., Wandel von Erwerbsarbeit und Begründungen kompe-tenzorientierten Lernens im internationalen Kontext (2001) Deregulierung der Arbeit - Pluralisierung der Bildung?

Universities are therefore encouraged to embed key skills in their curricula, yet there is often a considerable gap between what educational institutions offer and what is needed and required by the industry (i.e., there is a need to create a hub and interface between the industry and the institutions of higher education). One attempt to actually create this interface and increase the opportunities for graduates to maintain or obtain employment is to look at diverse skills and competencies that enhance employability of graduates. Although there have been considerable efforts to specify employability skills, the question of how these could be developed within the curriculum prevails. The purpose of the present paper is to theoretically discuss the concepts of employability, skills requirements, and competencies for graduates and to present the results of a quantitative survey carried out among domestic and international Management Center Innsbruck internship partners to assess the required employability skills of the market from the employers' point of view. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Curriculum design; Destination partners; Education; Industry relations; Skills and competencies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amoah, V.A., Baum, T., Tourism education: Policy versus practice (1997) International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 9 (1), pp. 5-12; Anderson, J.R., (2000) Cognitive psychology and its implications, , New York: Freeman; Atkins, M., Oven-ready and self-basting: Taking stock of employability skills (1999) Teaching in Higher Education, 4 (2), pp. 267-280; Bagshaw, N., Creating employability: How can training and development square the circle between individual and corporate interest?

It explores the backdrop of global changes which bring the notion of competences to the fore, worldwide, and then reports on the European Union's framework for competences. The construction of 'competence' is an ideological and political act, since it is an indication of a particular understanding of the 'good life', which may be different when viewed from within a social justice narrative or a neo-liberal narrative. The notion of 'metacompetence' is explored as a means of transcending the binary tension between an economic and a social narrative. European texts are best viewed as complex and multifaceted 'collages' which are dynamic, rather than static, and the term 'competence' in the texts is a good example of this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bentley, T., (2006) Imagine a Child of Five Today, , London: Demos and HTI; Carneiro, R., The Big Picture: Understanding learning and meta-learning challenges (2007) European Journal of Education, 42 (2), pp. 151-172. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1465-3435.2007.00303.x; Delor, J., (1996) Learning: The treasure within, , Paris: UNESCO; European Council (2000) Presidency Conclusions, Lisbon European Council 23 and 24 March 2000.

Public health professionals will need to be trained to respond to this challenge. The aim of this comparative study among Poland, the UK and the Netherlands is to identify competence needs for Master of Public Health graduates entering the labour market from a European perspective. A self-administered questionnaire was sent to employers in the three countries, rating the importance of competency in public health on a master's level. In all three countries, interpersonal competencies, like team working and communication skills, are rated as highly important. However, employers in the UK and Poland generally rate public health specific competencies as much more important than their Dutch colleagues. It is concluded that while public health specific knowledge is providing a useful starting point for entry-level public health professionals, employers increasingly recognise the value of generic competencies such as communication and team working skills. The results suggest a stronger emphasis on teaching methods that encourage active learning and the integration of skills, which is crucial for enhancing graduates' employability, and foster an open attitude to multidisciplinary working, which is essential in modern health care. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",Employers' perceptions; Europe; Graduate education; Key competencies; Non-medical public health professionals; Regression analysis,"academic achievement; article; employment; human; information processing; medical education; Netherlands; Poland; professional competence; regression analysis; standard; United Kingdom; Education, Graduate; Education, Public Health Professional; Employment; Focus Groups; Great Britain; Humans; Netherlands; Poland; Professional Competence; Regression Analysis",,,,,PL/00/B/F/PP/140155,"This study was funded by the European Commission Leonardo da Vinci programme (PL/00/B/F/PP/140155).

The purpose of this paper is to consider, the possibilities both of formal and informal learning and their relationship to competence development within higher education. Design/methodology/approach - An explorative, qualitative study based on focus groups was designed using different groups from formal and informal learning settings. Findings - The development of key competencies is based both on cognitive and non-cognitive dispositions and asks for multiple contexts. Through combining formal and informal learning settings within higher education - as part of a new learning culture - a variety of contexts can be given and competence development can be enhanced. Research limitations/implications - While aspects of both formal and informal learning settings could be identified, the interdependencies between them remain elusive. Practical implications - Based on the findings, some main aspects for acquiring competencies can be pointed out that may be crucial in higher education settings. Originality/value - The paper analyses the implications for both formal and informal learning settings of new ways of developing key competencies within higher education. Particular attention is given to interdisciplinarity and students' self-responsibility. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Competences; Higher education; Learning; Sustainable development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Altner, G., Michelsen, G., (2005) Baustelle Hochschule.

The study is restricted to employers of entry-level academic graduates entering public health organizations in the Netherlands. Given the changing and complex demands in public health, we study the relative importance of generic and field-specific competencies during the transition from education to the public health field. A self-explicated approach and a choice-based conjoint analysis were used to elicit preferences of employers for key competencies. The results show that employers value generic competencies relatively higher than field-specific competencies for master level graduates entering the public health field. The results are relevant for the adjustment of training in public health. Universities should continue to train master level graduates in public health with high-level cognitive skills. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Using just one single assessment method is not sufficient to determine competence acquisition. This article argues for Competence Assessment Programmes (CAPs), consisting of a combination of different assessment methods, including both traditional and new forms of assessment. To develop and evaluate CAPs, criteria to determine their quality are needed. Just as CAPs are combinations of traditional and new forms of assessment, criteria used to evaluate CAP quality should be derived from both psychometrics and edumetrics. A framework of 10 quality criteria for CAPs is presented, which is then compared to Messick's framework of construct validity. Results show that the 10-criterion framework partly overlaps with Messick's, but adds some important new criteria, which get a more prominent place in quality control issues in competence-based education. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The chief weaknesses and failings of NVQs and the competence-based education and training (CBET) system on which they are based are outlined in terms of assessment anomalies and the needs of firms, trainees and employers. Since these shortcomings are so so serious, it is suggested that - until they have been remedied through the current reforms under the aegis of the new Qualifications and Curriculum Authority - it is ethically unjustifiable to export a failed VET system to countries which may be unaware of the critical research surrounding NVQs and CBET.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ashworth, P.D., Being competent and having 'competencies' (1992) Journal of Further & Higher Education, 16 (3), pp. 8-17; Avis, J., Bloomer, M., Esland, G., Gleeson, D., Hodkinson, P., (1996) Knowledge and Nationhood, , London, Cassell; Barnett, R., (1994) The Limits of Competence, , Buckingam, Open University Press/Society for Research into Higher Education; Bates, I., Dutson, J., A Bermuda Triangle?

Competence strategies serve to de-skill and de-professionalise teaching and other public-service occupations by their technicist and reductionist approach to human values and knowledge. Educators committed to liberal values should eschew competence strategies in favour of learning theories inspired by the experiential tradition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alexander, D., Martin, I., Competence, curriculum and democracy (1995) Adult Learning, Critical Intelligence and Social Change, , Mayo, D. and Thompson, J.

It emphasises, however, that not all versions of 'competence' can be defended in these terms and that this requires a more generic and cognitively laden concept of personal and professional competence. © The Journal of the Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britain 1996.

It is argued that, although Smithers is broadly correct in his attack on the NCVQ, there are some areas of ambiguity and also ways in which the critique fails to capture the full scope of the problems. The nature and full implications of the inappropriateness of the NCVQ enterprise is illustrated through an examination of the main weaknesses of National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) and the competence-based education and training (CBET) strategy which underpins them and, in particular, by reviewing some specific problems of learning and assessment and the findings of a number of recent critical studies. In view of the seriousness of these shortcomings of the NCVQ system it is suggested that perhaps the only genuine solution to the current difficulties lies in the recommendations of the 1993 National Commission on Education report for the abolition of the present system of academic and vocational qualifications. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
