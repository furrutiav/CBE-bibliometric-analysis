This paper explores pedagogical strategies used by Rwandan teachers in primary schools to support their students’ learning subject content when English is the MOI. Findings from 24 interviews and four focus group discussions in four 12-year Basic Education schools indicate that teachers use a rich repertoire of strategies to support students’ learning, which can be clustered into four key themes: (1) communication in an unfamiliar MOI, (2) strategies for visual demonstration (3) strategies for engaging students, and (4) commitment to supporting students with different needs. The implications of these findings are discussed. © 2023",Competence-based curriculum; Medium of Instruction; Rwanda; Teaching strategies,,,"Alexander, R., Culture and pedagogy: International comparisons in primary education (2001), Blackwell Publishing Ltd; Arasomwan, D.A., Mashiy, N.J., Early childhood care and education educators’ understanding of the use of music-based pedagogies to teach communication skills (2021) South African Journal of Childhood Education, 11 (1), pp. 1-12; Babaci-Wilhite, Z., Zanzibar's curriculum reform: Implications for children's educational rights (2015) Prospects, pp. 181-195; Ball, J., Enhancing learning of children from diverse language backgrounds: Mother tongue-based bilingual or multilingual education in the early years (2011), www.reflect-action.org, UNESCO; Bowden, R., Barrett, A.M., (2022), Theory, practices and policies for “late exit” transition in the language of learning and teaching: A literature review (#02/2022; Bristol Working Papers in Education); Bowden, R., Uwineza, I., Dushimimana, J.C., Uworwabayeho, A., Learner-centred education and English medium instruction: Policies in practice in a lower-secondary mathematics class in rural Rwanda (2022) Compare: A Journal of Comparative and Internatinal Education, pp. 1-20; Brock-Utne, B., Whose education for all?

Using Ghana as a case study, this article shines light on the research question: What are the contexts and the implications of the contexts in which agriculture is taught on competence-based education? Drawing on a mixed methods approach involving cross-sectional data on 112 students, 238 teachers, and qualitative enquiries involving key informant interviews, and on-site observations. The findings showed inadequate facilities and low enrolment in agriculture. Specifically, 34% of pre-tertiary schools had less than 5% of the total student population offering agriculture. Theory-based pedagogies still dominate contrary to the core principles of competence-based education, culminating in students limited hands-on exposure that demotivates teachers and learners. We recommend the Ministry of Education focuses on competence-based education by increasing funding allocation to address the inadequate facilities, classrooms, and equipment needed for the effective teaching, learning, and the practice of agriculture. This article argues for sustained investment and conscious efforts directed at addressing challenges constraining CBE to allay the myths, drudgery, and low potentials ascribed to agriculture, with an ultimate aim to motivate the youth to pursue agriculture as a career and game-changer in providing self-employment and resolving the high unemployment phenomenon in the sub-region. © 2023 The Author(s).

Therefore, it is essential to look at teachers' knowledge, understanding, and perceptions of any educational innovation. The present study aims to examine knowledge, understanding and perceptions of Rwandan science teachers with respect to the competence-based curriculum (CBC) introduced in 2015. The 2015 curriculum framework included features like the rationale for its adoption, the concept of competence, different competences to be developed by learners upon CBC implementation, principles guiding CBC implementation, and cross-cutting issues to be addressed by CBC implementation. This research is a multiple case study that adopted a qualitative approach with interpretivism paradigm. Twelve science teachers from three secondary schools, selected based on their differing teaching experience, participated in the study. Data were collected through semi-structured face-to-face interviews. The data were transcribed and qualitatively analyzed using content analysis. The findings revealed some satisfactory knowledge, understanding and perceptions of science teachers. Further, knowledge and understanding gaps as well as negative perceptions of CBC were identified. Towards the effective and efficient implementation of the CBC, this research suggests appropriate training and establishment of the school community of practices for improving teachers' experience of the CBC. © 2023 The Author(s).",Competence-based curriculum; science teachers' knowledge and understanding; science teachers' perceptions,,,"Akkari, A., Lauwerier, T., Shafei, A.

Design: This study reviewed 95 articles published in four relevant scientific journals to determine the characteristics of a competence-based higher agricultural education system. These characteristics were determined based on competence-based education principles. Findings: The results of this review indicated that, based on the CBE principles, the competencies for agricultural educational components identified in the reviewed articles could be summarized in 22 categories. Practical implications: The main practical implication is that the universities can consider the results of this study as a set of guidelines in the admission of qualified learners and educators, revising curriculum and organizing dynamic learning environment in line with the CBE characteristics. Theoretical implications: The results of this study could take CBE principles one step further in that, determining characteristics of a competence-based higher agricultural education system can be a guideline on how these principles could be implemented in an education system. Originality/value: This study is original because it tries to bring CBE principles as a valuable theory into practice by the agricultural education systems. © 2023 Wageningen University.",agricultural higher education system; competence-based education; curriculum; educator; learner; learning environment,,,"Alibaygi, A., Pouya, M., Needs Assessment of Senior Agricultural Students Regarding Sustainability Knowledge (2011) African Journal of Agricultural Research, 6 (31), pp. 6542-6546; Aromataris, E., Pearson, A., The Systematic Review: An Overview (2014) AJN the American Journal of Nursing, 114 (3), pp. 53-58; Biemans, H., Van Mil, M., Learning Styles of Chinese and Dutch Students Compared Within the Context of Dutch Higher Education in Life Sciences (2008) The Journal of Agricultural Education and Extension, 14 (3), pp. 265-278; Carlone, H.B., Johnson, A., Understanding the Science Experiences of Successful Women of Color: Science Identity as an Analytic Lens (2007) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 44 (8), pp. 1187-1218; Corder, J., Irlbeck, E., Agricultural Communications Skills, Abilities and Knowledge Desired by Employers Compared to Current Curriculum: A Literary Review (2018) Journal of Agricultural Education, 59 (4), pp. 177-193; Garton, B.L., Ball, A.L., Dyer, J.E., The Academic Performance and Retention of College of Agriculture Students (2002) Journal of Agricultural Education, 43 (1), pp. 46-56; Gruppen, L.D., Mangrulkar, R.S., Kolars, J.C., The Promise of Competency-Based Education in the Health Professions for Improving Global Health (2012) Human Resources for Health, 10 (1), pp. 10-43; Hovakimyan, H., Klimek, M., Freyer, B., Vogel, S., Participation in Higher Education Curricula Development in Armenia and Possible Effects for the Labour Market—The Case of an “Organic Agriculture” Master’s Program (2021) Social Sciences, 10 (9), p. 331; Jamaludin, K.A., Alias, N., DeWitt, D., Kenayathulla, H.B., Razzaq, A.R.A., Employability Skills Valued by Employers in Malaysia (2019) Jurnal Kurikulum Pengajaran Asia Pasifik, 7 (2), pp. 30-37; Jjuuko, R., Tukundane, C., Zeelen, J., Exploring Agricultural Vocational Pedagogy in Uganda: Students’ Experiences (2019) International Journal of Training Research, 17 (3), pp. 238-251; Khoshnodifar, Z., Abbasi, E., Farhadian, H., Sadighi, H., Pouratashi, M., Comparative Comparison of Lecture and Team Member Teaching Design Methods in Agricultural Higher Education System of Iran (2020) Journal of Agricultural Science and Technology (JAST, 22 (4), pp. 891-904; Khoshnodifar, Z., Abbasi, E., Farhadian, H., Sadighi, H., Pouratashi, M., Alambaigi, A., Teamwork Behavior in Relation to Teacher, Student, Curriculum, and Learning Environment in Iranian Agricultural Higher Education System (2020) Journal of Agricultural Science and Technology (JAST), 22 (6), pp. 1431-1447; Koenen, A.K., Dochy, F., Berghmans, I., A Phenomenographic Analysis of the Implementation of Competence-Based Education in Higher Education (2015) Teaching and Teacher Education, 50, pp. 1-12; Kuijpers, M., Meijers, F., Gundy, C., The Relationship Between Learning Environment and Career Competencies of Students in Vocational Education (2011) Journal of Vocational Behavior, 78, pp. 21-30; Mankin, K.R., Boone, K.M., Flores, S., Willyard, M.R., What Agriculture Students Say Motivates Them to Learn (2004) Journal of North American Colleges and Teachers of Agriculture, 48 (4), pp. 6-11; Miller, S., Fredendall, L., Ferreira, W., Nilson, L., (2006), Identifying Competencies Possessed and the Skills Needed of Entry-Level College Graduate Agribusiness Employees Research Reports 187459, Clemson University, Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics; Misbah, Z., Gulikers, J., Maulana, R., Mulder, M., Teacher Interpersonal Behaviour and Student Motivation in Competence-Based Vocational Education: Evidence from Indonesia (2015) Teaching and Teacher Education, 50, pp. 79-89; Modak, S., Patel, M.C., Pal, P.K., Das, L., Nain, S., A Study of Entrepreneurial Competencies of Post Graduate Students in Agriculture (2018) Indian Journal of Agricultural Sciences, 88 (9), pp. 1391-1395; Mulder, M., Competence Development - Some Background Thoughts (2001) The Journal of Agricultural Education and Extension, 7 (4), pp. 147-158; Mulder, M., (2004), Education, competence and performance.

For a sample of Indonesian students, this study examined the connection between two dimensions of teacher interpersonal behaviour (proximity and influence) and student competency levels, as well as whether or not these relations are mediated by students’ intrinsic motivation. Additionally, it examined if these relations differed in learning environments with high versus low characteristics of competence-based education (HCBE vs. LCBE). Three questionnaires responded to by 506 first-year students were analysed using multigroups structural equation modelling. Teacher cooperative behaviour affected student motivation positively, and the influence was stronger in LCBE learning environments. Teacher controlling behaviour reduced student-perceived competency levels, with the reduction stronger in HCBE learning environments. Implications of the findings for teaching and learning in vocational education are discussed. © 2021, The Author(s).",Competence-based vocational education; Competency level; Intrinsic motivation; Teacher interpersonal behaviour,,,"Ahmed, W., Minnaert, A., van De Werf, M.P.C., Kuyper, H., Perceived social support and early adolescents’ achievement: The mediational roles of motivational beliefs and emotions (2010) Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 39 (1), pp. 36-46; Arbuckle, J.L., (2012) IBM SPSS Amos 21 user’s guide., , Amos Development Corporation; Bentler, P.M., Comparative fit indexes in structural models (1990) Psychological Bulletin, 107, pp. 238-246; Bentler, P.M., Bonnet, D.G., Significance tests and goodness of fit in the analysis of covariances structures (1980) Psychological Bulletin, 88, pp. 588-606; Biemans, H., Nieuwenhuis, L., Poell, R., Mulder, M., Wesselink, R., Competence based VET in the Netherlands: Backgrounds and pitfalls (2004) Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 56 (2), pp. 523-538; Billett, S., Knowing in practice: Re-conceptualising vocational expertise (2001) Learning and Instruction, 11 (6), pp. 431-452; Billett, S., Vocational curriculum and pedagogy: An activity theory perspective (2003) European Educational Research Journal, 2 (1), pp. 6-19; Bollen, K.A., (1989) Structural Equations with Latent Variables, , Willey; Brekelmans, M., (1989) Interpersonal teacher behaviour in the classroom.

Competence-based curricula encourage creativity and problem solving but little is known about their development in low-income countries or relationship with conventional academic outcomes like literacy. This study examines pupils’ cognitive flexibility, the underlying basis for many 21st-century skills, in Rwandan primary schools and finds little association with their reading abilities. The findings advance international knowledge regarding child development in resource-poor contexts, suggest a need for more holistic measurement and offer a new approach for understanding learners’ adaptability. © 2022 The Authors",21st-century skills; Adaptability; Cognitive flexibility; Creativity; Problem solving; Rwanda,adaptive management; child development; cognition; COVID-19; knowledge; learning; literacy; primary education; student; twenty first century; Rwanda,Economic and Social Research Council,"Abadzi, H., Training 21st-century workers: facts, fiction and memory illusions (2016) Int.

However, empirical evidence that demonstrates the effectiveness of CBE/T is scarce. Positioning the study within the theory of strategic alignment and comprehensive competence-based training, we used the authentic core job task ‘On-Site Helping of Farmers during the Planting of Maize’, of Development Agents as problem context and conducted an experimental-longitudinal research study including multirater performance assessment. The study compared competence development of the Development Agents who received training that could be characterized as ‘High-CBT’ (N = 33) and ‘Low-CBT’ (N = 32). ‘High-CBT’ means that in these training programmes, principles of competence-based training were used more completely than in the ‘Low-CBT’ programmes. Experts rated the competence levels of the Development Agents and Development Agents rated their own competence levels. Both groups did that before and after the training. Individual Development Agent performance was also rated by Trained Assessors. Longitudinally, Development Agent performance data was collected during one production year at three points in time. Development Agent's competence development in the ‘High-CBT’ training condition was higher than in the ‘Low-CBT’ condition. Observations made on each Development Agent's performance by Trained Assessors both in the Farmer Training Centres and in the authentic job situations, generally confirmed better performance of the ‘High-CBT’ group compared with the ‘Low-CBT’ group. The finding contributes to the state of research on the relationship between competence development and performance improvement, which is theoretically postulated although less empirically tested. © 2022 The Authors.

The aim of the study was to determine which factors contribute to teacher educators´ commitment to work and give them energy for work and self-development. The research data consisted of 24 teacher educators in Oulu University of Applied Sciences. The research method of this case study was a qualitative, thematic content analysis, the research approach phenomenography. The most important single factor seemed to be the community of teachers, students and the administrative staff which are included in dialogue and collaboration. Emotions, meaningfulness, and interaction play an important role, often via pedagogical fellowship. Committed teacher educators take responsibility for workplace culture and transformation of teaching. Positive attitudes, motivation, reflection, and dialogue seem to be connected to professional capability and the ethos of teacher educators´ work. © 2022 The Author(s).",Co-passion; Dialogue; Professional identity; Sociocultural environment; Transformation,,,"Ahlvik, C., Paakkanen, M., Itsemyötätuntoa työelämään [Self-compassion to work life.] (2017) Myötätunnon mullistava voima [The revolutionary power of compassion], pp. 151-165. , A.

The theory and practice of the competence-based approach should preferably be included in vocational teacher studies. Yet, there are still relatively few organisations implementing competence-based vocational teacher education in Finland. This article examines the realisation of competence-based vocational teacher education. The small-scale mixed-method case study explains the student teachers’ conceptions of the competence goals in their studies. The competence goals describe the competencies to be achieved as a result of training. According to the research findings, competence goals clarify the student teachers’ understanding of the demands of a teacher’s work, facilitate students to reflect on their competences and help in preparing individual study plans and promoting their studies. However, the student teachers need university teachers’ guidance to get their studies started and to promote the competences flexibly. © 2020 Association for Teacher Education in Europe.",coaching; Competence-based education; learning objectives; student mentoring; student teacher,,European Research Council; Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,"Andersson, P., Fejes, A., Sandberg, F., Introducing Research on Recognition of Prior Learning (2013) International Journal of Lifelong Education, 32 (4), pp. 405-411; (2007) The Bologna Process and Finnish Universities of Applied Sciences: The Final Report of The Project, , Helsinki: Arene; Baartman, L.K., Bastiaens, T.J., Kirschner, P.A., van der Vleuten, C.P.M., The Wheel of Competency Assessment: Presenting Quality Criteria for Competency Assessment Programs (2006) Studies in Educational Evaluation, 32, pp. 153-170; Berg, B.L., Lune, H., (2012) Qualitative Research Methods for the Social Sciences, , 8th, Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, and, ed; Biemans, H., Nieuwenhuis, L., Poell, R., Mulder, M., Wesselink, R., Competence-based VET in the Netherlands: Background and Pitfalls (2004) Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 56 (4), pp. 523-538; Biemans, H., Wesselink, R., Gulikers, J., Schaafsma, S., Verstegen, J., Mulder, M., Towards Competence-based VET: Dealing with the Pitfalls (2009) Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 61 (3), pp. 267-286; Billett, S., Knowing in Practice: Re-conceptualising Vocational Expertise (2001) Learning and Instruction, 11, pp. 431-452; Boud, D., (1995) Enhancing Learning Through Self-Assessment, , London: Kogan Page; Boud, D., Molloy, E., Rethinking Models of Feedback for Learning: The Challenge of Design (2012) Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education, 38 (6), pp. 698-712; Bowden, J., Marton, F., (1998) The University of Learning: Beyond Quality and Competence in Higher Education, , London: Kogan Page; Brodie, K., Sanni, R., ‘We Won’t Know It since We Don’t Teach It’: Interactions between Teachers’ Knowledge and Practice (2014) African Journal of Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education, 18 (2), pp. 188-197; Brooks, S., Dobbins, K., Scott, J.J.A., Rawlinson, M., Norman, R.I., Learning About Learning Outcomes: The Student Perspective (2014) Teaching in Higher Education, 19 (6), pp. 721-733; Check, J., Schutt, R.K., Survey Research (2012) Research Methods in Education, pp. 159-185. , Check J., Schutt R.K., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, and,. edited by; Colman, A.M., (2009) Dictionary of Psychology, , 3rd, Oxford: Oxford University Press, ed; Creswell, J.W., (2014) Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Day, C., Competence-based Education and Teacher Professional Development (2017) Competence-based Vocational and Professional Education: Bridging the Worlds of Work and Education, pp. 165-182. , Mulder M., (ed), Switzerland: Springer Verlag,. edited by; de Bruijn, E., Leeman, Y., Authentic and Self-directed Learning in Vocational Education: Challenges to Vocational Educators (2011) Teaching and Teacher Education, 27, pp. 694-702; de Brujin, E., Teaching in Innovative Vocational Education in the Netherlands (2012) Teachers and Teaching: Theory and Practice, 18 (6), pp. 637-653; De Bruyckere, P., Kirschner, P.A., Hulshof, C.D., (2015), pp. 54-57. , De Bruyckere P., Kirschner P.A., Hulshof C.D., (eds), London: Elsevier, and,.

Collaboration of teachers has long been appreciated for its significant benefits including increased motivation, job satisfaction, self- and collective efficacy, as well as its role in teacher professional development and school improvement. Collaboration of teachers working in VET schools, especially in VET systems where initial VET is provided to young people and (in part) within compulsory education, appears as particularly desirable, given the special context, objectives and challenges of this sector and the spread of competence-based education. However, relatively little is known about VET teacher collaboration, especially in Hungary, where three different profiles of teachers—general subject and vocational teachers and vocational trainers—work in VET schools. The aim of our study was to provide data about how Hungarian VET teachers collaborate, which could validate prior research results on teacher collaboration as well as identify any special features of the VET context. Method: Our study design was exploratory, descriptive and correlational, applying quantitative statistical analysis. We measured teacher collaboration (practice and perception of impact) and explanatory individual and organisational factors selected for our research framework by adapting instruments of previous empirical studies (most importantly, OECD’s TALIS). We analysed connections between collaboration and independent variables created by principal component analysis. Results: Our data show that sharing-type collaboration (professional discussions and exchange of materials) are widespread among Hungarian VET teachers. They are much less likely to participate in deeper collaborative activities that presuppose higher levels of interdependence, and they also appreciate the impact of deeper collaboration less. Female respondents participate in sharing-type activities more than their male colleagues, and middle-aged (40–55) are most active in both types of collaboration and perceive the most impact. Collaboration practices correlate most with perceptions of their impact. More frequent collaboration and perceptions of higher impact are related to teachers’ sense of higher self-efficacy and relaxed, tolerant and encouraging collegial relationships. Structural barriers seem to influence only sharing and perceptions of impact. Small, but statistically significant differences in collaboration were found between the three teacher profiles. Vocational trainers (who instruct vocational school practice) showed the highest level of participation in deeper collaboration, while vocational teachers were least likely to participate and perceived the least impact. No significant associations were found between collaboration and prior or current work experience in the taught vocation. Conclusions: Our results largely confirm and validate previous research on teacher collaboration in lower level and general educational contexts by providing data on VET teacher collaboration. They also note the role of some VET-specific factors, such as structural barriers and small, but statistically significant differences between different VET teacher profiles. © 2021, The Author(s).",Collegiality; Teacher collaboration; Teacher professional development and learning; Teacher survey; Vocational education and training,,,"Ainley, J., Carstens, R., (2018) Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) 2018 Conceptual Framework, , https://doi.org/10.1787/799337c2-en, OECD Working Papers, No. 187.

This paper aims to discuss the qualities of competence-oriented educational processes and the recent movement towards competence-based curricula in higher education. Design/methodology/approach: This study follows a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology to explore the concept of competence within the context of educational science. The subsequent thematic synthesis analyses the findings of reviewed publications regarding graduate attributes in competence-oriented higher education and their perspectives and working-life expectations on exit profiles. Findings: Interest in competence-oriented education, training and learning has grown in recent years, resulting in numerous theoretical and technical pedagogical applications in higher education. Nonetheless, ambiguous terminology presents a significant challenge, which is demonstrated by the inconsistent language of the study's results. Moreover, there is an obvious need for teachers' in-service training. The qualitative synthesis of this article will be useful for both educational and working life sectors to inform and promote different perspectives on competence-oriented educational processes. A clear articulation of competences is crucial for reforming higher education to meet students' interests and recognise their work-life needs. Originality/value: The concept of competence has been under-investigated in higher education research and practices. This study offers novel insights and practical implications for competence-oriented learning concerning the paradigmatic change across higher education. © 2021, Sanna Brauer.",Competence-oriented education; Curricular development; Exit profile; Higher education; Working life,,Opetus- ja Kulttuuriministeriö,"Baartman, L., Ruijs, L., Comparing students' perceived and actual competence in higher vocational education (2011) Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education, 36 (4), pp. 385-398; Barman, A., Konwar, J., Competency-based curriculum in higher education: a necessity grounded by globalization (2011) Revista Romaneasca Pentru Educatie Multidimensionala, 3 (6), pp. 7-15; Beneitone, P., Bartolomé, E., Global generic competences with local ownership: a comparative study from the perspective of graduates in four world regions (2014) Tuning Journal For Higher Education, 1 (2), pp. 303-334; Billett, S., Knowing in practice: re-conceptualising vocational expertise (2001) Learning and Instruction, 11, pp. 431-452; Boelens, R., De Wever, B., Voet, M., Four key challenges to the design of blended learning: a systematic literature review (2017) Educational Research Review, 22, pp. 1-18; Borrego, M., Foster, M.J., Froyd, J., Systematic literature review in engineering education and other developing interdisciplinary fields (2014) Journal of Engineering Education, 103 (1), pp. 45-76; Brauer, S., (2019) Digital Open Badge-Driven Learning: Competence-Based Professional Development for Vocational Teachers, , (Doctoral dissertation), Acta Universitatis Lapponiensis 380, Lapland University Press, Rovaniemi; Bravenboer, D., Lester, S., Towards an integrated approach to the recognition of professional competence and academic learning (2016) Education and Training, 58 (4), pp. 409-421; Costley, C., Organizational and employee interests in programs of work based learning (2001) The Learning Organization, 8 (2), pp. 58-63; Dannefer, E., Henson, L., The portfolio approach to competency-based assessment at the cleveland clinic lerner college of medicine (2007) Academic Medicine, 82 (5), pp. 493-502; Davies, H., Competence-based curricula in the context of Bologna and EU higher education policy (2017) Pharmacy: Journal of Pharmacy, Education and Practice, 5 (2); de los Ríos-Carmenado, I., Sastre-Merino, S., Fernández Jiménez, C., Núñez del Río, M., Reyes Pozo, E., García Arjona, N., Proposals for improving assessment systems in higher education: an approach from the model working with people (2016) Journal of Technology and Science Education, 6 (2), pp. 104-120; Eraut, M., Informal learning in the workplace (2004) Studies in Continuing Education, 26 (2), pp. 247-273; Recommendation on the establishment of the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning (2008) Official Journal of the European Union, 51, pp. 1-7. , C 111; Council conclusions on a renewed EU agenda for higher education (2017) Official Journal of the European Union, 60, pp. 3-7. , C 429; Recommendation on key competences for lifelong learning (2018) Official Journal of the European Union, 61, pp. 1-6. , C 189; Gessler, M., Siemer, C., Umbrella review: methodological review of reviews published in peer-reviewed journals with a substantial focus on vocational education and training research (2020) International Journal for Research in Vocational Education and Training, 7 (1), pp. 91-125; Hart, C., (2018) Doing a Literature Review: Release the Research Imagination, , 2nd ed., Sage Publications, London; Hodge, K., Lear, J.L., Employment skills for 21st-century workplace: the gap between faculty and student perceptions (2011) Journal of Career and Technical Education, 26 (2), pp. 28-41; (2013) Graduate attributes and professional competencies, , http://www.ieagreements.org/assets/Uploads/Documents/Policy/Graduate-Attributes-and-Professional-Competencies.pdf, v, ersion 3:21: accessed, 28 July 2020; Ion, G., Cano, E., Cabrera, N., Competency Assessment Tool (CAT).

Zhongshan Rd.3663, Shanghai, 200062, China","Context: International comparative research on Vocational Education and Training (VET) is gaining importance, as global cooperation and mutual learning in VET grows. However, it is characterized by a high degree of complexity, due on one hand, to the heterogeneity of the VET sector, and on the other hand to the unique challenges of international comparisons. In addition, comparative research projects are increasingly conducted in the form of cross-border collaborations, which have their own particular organizational and methodological considerations, opportunities, and challenges. This paper presents an example of a cooperative research process, aimed at investigating the complex phenomenon of the competence-based approach in Russian and Chinese VET. In providing an example of developing an instrument for curriculum analysis and comparison, we discuss and reflect on the methodological and organizational peculiarities and challenges of the research process conducted collaboratively by an international team. Method: The instrument for analysis and comparison of curricular documents, was developed in an iterative multi-stage process, combining deductive and inductive steps. The embeddedness of the elements of a competence-based approach in curricular documents is investigated, using qualitative content analysis. To develop a coding frame, we started with a comprehensive partially systematic literature review of international, Russian and Chinese discourses on competence-based curricula. The frame was built on the selected model of competence-based education, and on accumulated results of the literature analysis of national discourses. Furthermore, during the first coding process, an iterative adaptation of the developed instrument took place. Results: The result of this process was the development of an analysis instrument which, on the one hand, is well-adapted to each national context and, on the other hand, allows a comparison of results along the same dimensions of analysis, in our case, elements of the competence-based approach in curriculum. Conclusion: Developing an analysis framework for a cross-cultural comparative investigation of such a diffuse and heterogeneous construct as the competence-based approach, can pose a methodological challenge for an international team of researchers. However, an effective application of own team resources such as proficiency in different languages, insider and outsider perspectives, along with continuous intensive communication and a flexible, iterative research process, allows development of a well-adapted analysis instrument for international comparison. © 2021 European Research Network Vocational Education and Training.

The problem addressed by this study is “under which conditions will the implementation of the intended science curriculum be realised in classroom”. Framed by the Rogan and Grayson theory of curriculum implementation, a multiple case study was conducted to explore the relationships between a school’s profile of science CBC implementation and its capacity to support innovation. This was done by interviewing 12 teachers, observing and recording 23 of their science lessons, and surveying school facilities in their three schools. The data were presented in narrative form based on ratings (1–4) of lessons and schools’ capacity to innovate. Despite the variations between teachers and schools in CBC implementation caused by differences in individual professional development and schools’ capacity to innovate, the results revealed high levels of appropriate CBC implementation in aspects of classroom interactions, teaching and learning activities, and assessment. On the other hand, a low implementation level was noticed in the aspect of science-in-society. The study findings relate the profile of science CBC implementation to some aspects of a school’s capacity to innovate, particularly individual teacher’s experience, inadequate preparedness to enact CBC and inadequate teaching and learning resources for science. For successful implementation of science CBC, strong and regular training programmes that focus on how the new ideas are put into practice, together with the provision of teaching and learning resources for science, are recommended. © 2021 Southern African Association for Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education (SAARMSTE).",capacity to innovate; Competence-based curriculum; profile of science curriculum implementation; Rwanda,,,"Albanese, M.A., Mejicano, G., Mullan, P., Kokotailo, P., Gruppen, L., Defining characteristics of educational competencies (2008) Medical Education, 42 (3), pp. 248-255; Altinyelken, H.K., Curriculum change in Uganda: Teacher perspectives on the new thematic curriculum (2010) International Journal of Educational Development, 30 (2), pp. 151-161; Bainton, D., Barrett, M.A., Tikly, L., (2016) Improving secondary school teacher quality in Sub Saharan Africa: Framing the issues, , University of Bristol, &,.

The initiatives implemented have focused primarily on promoting the combined development of no more than three key competences. This article presents an international study under the Erasmus+ and H2020 programmes, for analysing the impact of the STEAM project-based learning approach with KIKS format (Kids Inspire Kids for STEAM) on the interwoven development of key competences. The sample included 267 high school students divided into53teams from29 educational centres in Finland, England, Hungary, and Spain. Each team carried out several projects for no less than two academic years, by means of the following two approaches: STEAM project-based learning and KIKS. Data were collected from observations and interviews with students, teachers, and KIKS trainers. Analyses revealed that the combination of these two approaches facilitate the development of all eight key competences. The project-based learning focus essentially fostered the enhancement of the mathematical competence and in science, technology, and engineering, while KIKS format promoted literacy and multilingual competences. The remaining competences were encouraged by the combination of both approaches. It is noteworthy that prolonged participation in the programme, as it was implemented, was crucial to achieving the obtained outcomes. © 2021, Revista Científica de Educomunicación.

Although there is plenty of research nationally and internationally about the idea of competence-based education, the student perspective has remained in the shadow. This research focused on vocational special education teacher students’ experiences of the competence-based education. They started at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences in 2014 in the new competence-based teacher training program. This was a narrative research focusing on the students’ (N = 20) descriptions of their study processes. The data consisted of their written narratives as well as personal interviews at the beginning and end of the study process. Students’ experiences of the different phases of education and perceived benefits and challenges of competence-based education are introduced as results. While the competence-based education seemed to serve well adult students participating in it, there are many definitions and practices that have to be studied and defined better. Suggestions for future development to enhance both vocational teacher training and competence-based education in general are discussed based on the findings. © 2019, The Author(s).",Competence; Competence-based education; Narrative research; Vocational special education teacher,,,"Adam, S., (2004); Altbach, P.G., Knight, J., The internationalization of higher education: motivations and realities (2007) Journal of Studies in International Education, 11 (3-4), pp. 290-305; Baker, R.B., (2015) The student experience.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether the perspectives of teacher educators, teachers and students on good education in vocational education are aligned with what literature says about Powerful Learning Environments (PLEs) and to what extent the perspectives of different groups of stakeholders are mutually aligned. Results of nine focus group interviews showed that perspectives are mostly similar in the three groups. They strongly favoured authentic and challenging pathways, endorsed the importance of supporting opportunities for developing key competences and, although not univocal by students, adaptive teaching and learning support, within a positive and safe learning community. Differences between preferences of different stakeholders on some of the design characteristics of PLEs underline the importance of developing a shared understanding about learning and teaching among stakeholders. © 2019, © 2019 Association for Teacher Education in Europe.",co-design; powerful learning environments; shared understanding; stakeholder perspectives; Vocational education,,,"Biemans, H.A., Jongmans, C.T., de Jong, F.P.C.M., Bergen, T.C.M., Perceptions of Teachers’ Instructional Behavior in Secondary Agricultural Education (1999) Journal of Agricultural Education and Extension, 5, pp. 231-238; Billett, S., Knowing in Practice: Re-conceptualising Vocational Expertise (2001) Learning and Instruction, 11, pp. 431-452; Cober, R., Tan, E., Slotta, J.D., So, H.-J., Könings, K.D., Teachers as Participatory Designers: Two Case Studies with Technology-enhanced Learning Environments (2015) Instructional Science, 43, pp. 203-228; Coburn, C.E., Penuel, W.R., Research-practice Partnerships: Outcomes, Dynamics, and Open Questions (2016) Educational Researcher, 45, pp. 48-54; Coburn, C.E., Penuel, W.R., Geil, K., (2013) Research-practice Partnerships at the District Level: A New Strategy for Leveraging Research for Educational Improvement, , New York, NY: William T.

Little is known, however, about the processes leading to successful implementation of CBE and about its outcomes. This study investigates the effects that the level of CBE implementation has on student satisfaction (regarding the quality of education, guidance, and the development of interpersonal and general vocational skills) and to what extent CBE implementation mediates the relationship between teacher team learning activities and student satisfaction. To this end, data was gathered from 662 teachers belonging to 46 teacher teams in senior secondary vocational education in the Netherlands, and their students. Multilevel structural equation modelling revealed that teacher team learning was positively associated with te implementation of CBE. Furthermore, CBE had a positive effect on student satisfaction with quality of education, guidance, and development of interpersonal skills; however, no significant effect was found on student satisfaction with the development of general vocational skills. These results indicate that implementation of CBE has, to some degree, fulfilled its promise of better preparing students for their future workplace and that teacher team learning can support the further implementation of CBE.

From 2016, the Rwanda education system introduced a new curriculum known as Competence-Based Curriculum (CBC), which ensures fosters more the learner-centered approach. This study was carried out to assess CBC input after four years of implementation. For this assessment, the reformed teaching observation protocol (RTOP) was used to observe 42 classes from 17 classrooms taught by nine teachers from the eastern province and Kigali city in Rwanda. Outcomes of our analysis indicated that after four years of CBC implementation, learners’ active participation has improved. The overall aggregate scores of observed lessons were 2.16 out of 4 ratings (54%) across all the 25 RTOP statements. Grouping the RTOP statements into six factors, learner-centered physics class is practiced at a 61% level while the overall reformed physics class is at a level of 53%. The results of this study led us to formulate some recommendations that would more improve physics students’ active learning. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

The study findings reveal that even though the CBC has been introduced in different SSA countries to enhance the quality of education, the science curriculum is still implemented in traditional ways. Consequently, CBC is not effectively addressing socio-economic needs as intended, at both individual and national level. The authors are concerned with how CBC is being implemented in other SSA countries that recently have adopted this kind of curriculum and how it will be implemented in other SSA countries that are planning to embrace it. In this paper, the authors suggest ways the new ideas could be introduced and reflect on how CBC can be implemented in SSA countries that share socio-economic and environmental similarities. They finally strongly recommend the establishment of special ‘laboratory’ schools or science education centres as well as school-based communities of practice to enhance teachers’ content knowledge and nurture contemporary teaching methods for the successful implementation of the new ideas. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Competence-based curriculum; reflection; science curriculum implementation; Sub-Saharan Africa,,,"Albanese, M.A., Mejicano, G., Mullan, P., Kokotailo, P., Gruppen, L., Defining characteristics of educational competencies (2008) Medical Education, 42 (3), pp. 248-255. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2923.2007.02996.x; Ampadu, E., Students’ perceptions of their teachers’ teaching of Mathematics: The case of Ghana (2012) International Online Journal of Educational Sciences, 4 (2), pp. 351-358; Audet, R.H., Jordan, L.K., (2003) Standards in the classroom: An implementation guide for teachers of science and mathematics, , Corwin Press; Bainton, D., Barrett, M.A., Tikly, L., (2016) Improving secondary school teacher quality in Sub Saharan Africa: Framing the Issues, , Working papers education series.

It examines the extent to which CBE design principles of the Comprehensive Competence-Based Education Framework developed in a Western context exist in Indonesian policy documents and school practices. This study reviews educational policy documents and collects cross-sectional survey data from 41 school principals, 453 teachers, and 2219 students from 41 agricultural vocational schools in five provinces of Java, Indonesia. Results showed that the ten CCBE principles listed in the framework exist to large extent in Indonesian policy documents. School principals, teachers, and students noticed the realisation of CCBE principles in the study programme to differing degrees, except for the principle of flexibility that was largely absent. The level of CBE implementation varied, from the level of starting competence-based to that of largely competence-based education. The findings contribute to the discussion of CCBE design principles and lesson learned of CBE implementation in a non-western perspective. © 2019 The Author(s).

Design: This research is a comparative analysis of two groups. The first group consists of undergraduate and graduate students majoring in agriculture who are members and non-members of student cooperatives (n = 256). The second group consists of agricultural faculty members (n = 59). Findings: The results of this study show that students and teachers have different views with regard to the extent to which CBE principles are practiced in the College of Agriculture. Moreover, students with different learning patterns had different perceptions regarding the extent to which CBE is practiced, whereas teachers with different teaching patterns had the same perception of the application of CBE principles in the College of Agriculture. Practical implications: This study has practical implications for agricultural higher education in general and colleges of agriculture in particular. Colleges of agriculture across Iran could encourage their students to establish and engage in student cooperatives so that the ‘what’ and ‘how’ aspects of CBE are put into practice. Theoretical implications: This study has theoretical implications for CBE principles. For example, student cooperatives can be utilized by faculty members as one of the main strategies for developing CBE in agricultural colleges. Originality/value: This study is original in that it moves from theory to practice when considering CBE. © 2019, © 2019 Wageningen University.",competence-based education; Perception; student cooperative,,,"Aghapour, S.H., Mohammadi, S.H.M., Alambeigi, A., Key Skills Role in Employability Formation of College Students (2014) Researh and Planning in Highrt Education, 1 (6), pp. 41-56; Baraabadi, S.A., Mohammadi, M., Asadi, A.S., Analysis of Educational and Socio-Cultural Barriers to the Employment of Agricultural Graduates (2010) Work and Society, 109, pp. 92-100; Bernaard, J., Chang, T.W., Popescu, E., Graf, S., Learning Style Identifier: Improving the Precision of Learning Style Identification Through Computational Intelligence Algorithms (2017) Expert Systems with Applications, 75, pp. 94-108; Biemans, H., Wesselink, R., Gulikers, J., Schaafsma, S., Verstegen, J., Mulder, M., Towards Competence-Based VET: Dealing With the Pitfalls (2009) Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 61 (3), pp. 267-286; Briesmaster, M., Briesmaster-Paredes, J., The Relationship Between Teaching Styles and NNPSETs’ Anxiety Levels (2015) System, 49, pp. 145-156; Cano, J., The Relationship Between Learning Style, Academic Major, and Academic Performance of College Students (1999) Journal of Agricultural Education, 40 (1), pp. 30-37; Cronbach, L.J., Coefficient Alpha and the Internal Structure of Tests (1951) Psychometrika, 16 (3), pp. 297-334; Dilekli, Y., Tezci, E., The Relationship among Teachers’ Classroom Practices for Teaching Thinking Skills, Teachers’ Self-Efficacy Towards Teaching Thinking Skills and Teachers’ Teaching Styles (2016) Thinking Skills and Creativity, 21, pp. 144-151; Din, M., Indices of Discrepancy Between Students’ Learning Styles and their Grade Achievement at Masters’ Level (2017) British Journal of Education, 5 (2), pp. 10-20; Felder, R.M., Soloman, B.A., (2000), Learning Styles and Strategies.

CBVE researchers have complained about the lack of evidence that CBVE results in better competence development, the decreasing attention for knowledge development in CBVE practice, and the cross-sectional nature of much CBVE research. This study addresses these issues by reviewing a worldwide competence-based education literature and comparing competence and knowledge development of students in vocational schools in Indonesia that have implemented principles of CBVE to a higher or lesser degree. The study involved 506 students majoring in food processing and technology and 32 teachers from 11 agricultural secondary vocational schools. Teachers and students rated student competence levels. Student knowledge was assessed with a multiple-choice test. Longitudinal data were collected during one school year at three points of time. Student competence development in high-CBVE was higher than in low-CBVE, suggesting that the implementation of CBVE was successful and had a motivating effect of both students and teachers in Indonesian vocational schools. However, knowledge development was indeed lower in high-CBVE than in low-CBVE, which needs further attention. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",Agriculture vocational education; Competence development; Competence-based education; Indonesia; Knowledge development,,,"Baartman, L.K.J., de Bruijn, E., Integrating knowledge, skills and attitudes: Conceptualising learning processes towards vocational competence (2011) Educational Research Review, 6, pp. 125-134; Baartman, L.K.J., Ruijs, L., Comparing students’ perceived and actual competence in higher vocational education (2011) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 36 (4), pp. 385-398; Bathmaker, A.M., Defining ‘knowledge’ in vocational education qualifications in England: An analysis of key stakeholders and their constructions of knowledge, purposes and content (2013) Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 65 (1), pp. 87-107; Biemans, H., Nieuwenhuis, L., Poell, R., Mulder, M., Wesselink, R., Competence based VET in the Netherlands: Backgrounds and pitfalls (2004) Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 56 (2), pp. 523-538; Biemans, H., Wesselink, R., Gulikers, J., Schaafsma, S., Verstegen, J., Mulder, M., Towards competence-based VET: Dealing with the pitfalls (2009) Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 61 (3), pp. 267-286; Billet, S., Constructing vocational knowledge: Situations and other social sources (1998) Journal of Education and Work, 11 (3), pp. 255-273; Billet, S., Knowing in practice: Reconceptualising vocational expertise (2001) Learning and Instruction, 11 (6), pp. 431-452; Blömeke, S., Assuring quality in competence assessments: The value-added of applying different assessment approaches to professional education (2016) Competence-based vocational and professional education: Bridging the world of work and education, pp. 631-648. , Mulder M, (ed), Springer, Singapore; Boahin, P., Hofman, W.H.A., Perceived effects of competence-based training on the acquisition of professional skills (2014) International Journal of Educational Development, 36, pp. 81-89; Braun, E., Woodley, A., Richardson, J.T.E., Leidner, B., Self-rated competencies questionnaire from a design perspective (2012) Educational Research Review, 7 (1), pp. 1-18; Brockmann, M., Clarke, L., Méhaut, P., Winch, C., Competence-based vocational education andtraining (VET): The cases of England and France in a European Perspective (2008) Vocations and Learning, 1, pp. 227-244; Cho, Y.J., Weinstein, C.E., Wicker, F., Perceived competence and autonomy as moderators of the effects of achievement goal orientations (2011) Educational Psychology: An International Journal of Experimental Educational Psychology, 31 (4), pp. 393-411; Eraut, M., Informal learning in the workplace (2004) Studies in Continuing Education, 26 (2), pp. 247-273; Field, A., (2013) Discovering statistics using SPSS, , Sage Publications Limited, Thousand Oaks, CA; Gulikers, J.T.M., Biemans, H., Mulder, M., Developer, teacher, student and employer evaluations of competence-based assessment quality (2009) Studies in Educational Evaluation, 35 (2-3), pp. 110-119; Hager, P., Competence standards—a help or a hindrance?

A competence can be defined as an integrated and stable network of knowledge and know-how, with normative behaviors, procedures and types of reasoning. However, without a theoretical conceptualization of building and mobilization processes, the components of a competence are considered as isolated and not interconnected. In the health and physical education (HPE) setting, too few empirical studies have analyzed how teachers would contribute to the development of student’s competence. The aim of this forward-looking article grounded on an experiential and cultural framework consists in clarifying and illustrating a conceptualization of the dynamics of development of competences among students considering the teacher activity. This theoretical framework seems to offer heuristic possibilities for the examination of teaching and learning practices which contribute to the development of the key competences, particularly when a competence is read as an experience that integrates multiple dimensions. Based on audio-video recording of PE lessons and self-confrontation interviews with the teacher and a student, the results of the present study strengthen the criticism of the definition of competence emphasizing the relevance to adopt a holistic approach corresponding to the articulation of intertwined resources (i.e. motor, methodological and social) students allocate to act in PE groups. Furthermore, the results show that the competence building depends on various roles students have the opportunity to play in PE (i.e. observer, tutor). Finally, our results underline the importance of identifying the specific characteristics of the teacher activity designed to structure the learning environment to train students to acquire new competences transferable in society. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",competence; experience; Learning; physical education; teaching,conceptual framework; empiricism; human; human experiment; interview; learning environment; physical education; structure activity relation; student; teacher; teaching; theoretical study; videorecording,,"Barker, D., Quennerstedt, M., Annerstedt, C., Learning through group work in physical education: A symbolic interactionist approach (2015) Sport, Education and Society, 20, pp. 604-623; Blömeke, S., Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia, O., Kuhn, C., Fege, J., Modeling and measuring competencies in higher education: Tasks and challenges (2013) Modeling and measuring competencies in higher education, pp. 1-12. , Blömeke S., Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia O., Kuhn C., Fege J., (eds), Rotterdam: Sense Publishers, &,.

Therefore, a concomitant goal of higher education should be to help students develop metacognitive skills and domain-specific knowledge and skills. For many years, competence-based education and problem-based learning have dominated higher education. In this article, an overview of the principles and development of these concepts is given. Subsequently, based on self-regulation theory, approaches to learning and the demands of our society to learn how to face wicked problems, a sustainable approach to teaching and learning are outlined in this conceptual article. The multiple layers from which a sustainable learning environment should be built provide guidance for instructors during the design of their educational practice. Practical implications for educators to approach the transition to sustainable learning environments are given in the form of questions that can shape the dialogue on sustainable education. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

It draws both on the literature relating to entrepreneurial education and on competence-based education to set out five features of entrepreneurial teaching. For illustrative purposes, these five characteristics are explored in a questionnaire put to a small group of teaching staff. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs a qualitative approach, seeking to understand the personal perspectives of participants, and drawing out the complexities of their behaviour, whilst also providing a holistic interpretation of such behaviour. Findings: The literature review identifies five features of entrepreneurial teaching: embedding learning outcomes for a SIE within taught subjects; active entrepreneurial teaching; educating for entrepreneurial attitudes; networking activities; being entrepreneurial as part of lifelong learning. It can be hypothesised that teaching staff teach different aspects of the SIE depending on the subject they teach (vocational or more traditional) and their role (teacher or workshop assistant). Originality/value: Development of the SIE and the five characteristics of entrepreneurial teaching is a first step towards understanding how secondary vocational teachers and workshop assistants understand and teach the SIE as cross-curricular subject. In line with Fayolle and Gailly who called for deeper investigation of the most effective combinations of objectives, content and teaching methods, the paper seeks to establish a relationship between teaching methods, development of entrepreneurial attitudes and assessment. © 2018, Daniele Morselli.",Enterprise education; Italy; Key competence; Lifelong learning; Sense of initiative and entrepreneurship; Teaching,,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions,"Baartman, L.K., Bastiaens, T.J., Kirschner, P.A., van der Vleuten, C.P., Evaluating assessment quality in competence-based education: a qualitative comparison of two frameworks (2007) Educational Research Review, 2 (2), pp. 114-129; Balan, P., Metcalfe, M., Identifying teaching methods that engage entrepreneurship students (2012) Education + Training, 54 (5), pp. 368-384; Baschiera, B., Tessaro, F., Lo spirito di iniziativa e l’imprenditorialità.

Traditional universities, universities of applied sciences and institutions for vocational education are all challenged to educate these knowledge workers. Accordingly, these institutions are developing competence-based education programmes that promote authentic, self-directed learning and the development of a professional identity. A possible environment for realising this type of learning is the hybrid learning configuration in which learning is embedded in ill-defined and highly-authentic tasks. This study attempted to identify a set of principles that can underpin the design of such a learning configuration at the interface between school and workplace. The research approach consisted of educational design research. Starting from cognitive constructivist and socio-cultural perspectives, a set of initial design principles was developed and evaluated from the perspective of the participants during three consecutive iterations of design and implementation. The process resulted in a set of seven refined design principles which can be used as heuristics to guide the design and development of hybrid learning configurations in contexts that have similar goals and aligned tenets. © 2016, The Author(s).",Authentic learning; Educational design research; Hybrid learning configuration; University of applied sciences; Vocational education,,,"Akkerman, S.F., Bakker, A., Boundary crossing and boundary objects (2011) Review of Educational Research, 81 (2), pp. 132-169; Andriessen, D., Designing and testing an OD intervention (2007) The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, 43 (1), pp. 89-107; Antonides, E.H., Hoetink, F., (2005) Projectplan value in the Valley, energie om te leren, , Alfa-college, Groningen; Billett, S., Situated learning: Bridging sociocultural and cognitive theorising (1996) Learning and Instruction, 6 (3), pp. 263-280; Billett, S., Toward a workplace pedagogy: Guidance, participation, and engagement (2002) Adult Education Quarterly, 53 (1), pp. 27-43; Billett, S., Learning through work: Workplace participatory practices (2004) Workplace learning in context, pp. 109-125. , Rainbird H, Fuller A, Munro A, (eds), Routledge, London; Billett, S., Integrating experiences in workplace and university settings: A conceptual perspective (2011) Developing learning professional, pp. 21-40. , Billett S, Henderson A, (eds), Springer, London; Billet, S., Somerville, M., Transformations at work: Identity and learning (2004) Studies in Continuing Education, 26 (2), pp. 309-326; Boud, D., Reframing assessment as if learning were important (2007) Rethinking assessment in higher education: Learning for the longer term, pp. 14-25. , Boud D, Falchikov N, (eds), Routledge, London; Bromme, R., Tillema, H., Fusing experience and theory: The structure of professional knowledge (1995) Learning and Instruction, 5 (4), pp. 261-267; Bronkhorst, L.H., Meijer, P.C., Koster, B., Akkerman, S.F., Vermunt, J.D., Consequential research designs in research on teacher education (2013) Teaching and Teacher Education, 33, pp. 90-99; Brooker, R., Macdonald, D., Did we hear you?: Issues of student voice in a curriculum innovation (1999) Journal of Curriculum Studies, 31 (1), pp. 83-97; Brown, A.L., Campione, J.C., Psychological theory and the design of innovative learning environments: On procedures, principles, and systems (1996) Innovations in learning: New environments for education, pp. 289-325. , Schauble L, Glaser R, (eds), Erlbaum, Mahwah, NJ; Brown, J.S., Collins, A., Duguid, P., Situated cognition and the culture of learning (1989) Educational Researcher, 18 (1), pp. 32-42; Candy, P.C., (1991) Self-direction for lifelong learning: A comprehensive guide to theory and practice, , Jossey-Bass, San Francisco; Cremers, P.H.M., Hekman, E.G.A., (2010) Value in the Valley, evaluatie van het leerarrangement, , Value in the Valley, Groningen; Cremers, P.H.M., Wals, A.E.J., Wesselink, R., Nieveen, N., Mulder, M., Self-directed lifelong learning in hybrid learning configurations (2014) International Journal of Lifelong Education, 33 (2), pp. 207-232; Damasio, A.R., (1994) Descartes’ error: Emotion, rationality and the human brain, , Putnam, New York; De Bruijn, E., Leeman, Y., Authentic and self-directed learning in vocational education: Challenges to vocational educators (2010) Teaching and Teacher Education, 27 (4), pp. 694-702; De Putter-Smits, L.G.A., Taconis, R., Jochems, W.M.G., Mapping context-based learning environments: The construction of an instrument (2013) Learning Environments Research, 16 (3), pp. 437-462; Denyer, D., Tranfield, D., Van Aken, J.E., Developing design propositions through research synthesis (2008) Organization Studies, 29 (3), pp. 393-413; Eisner, E.W., (1991) The enlightened eye: Qualitative inquiry and the enhancement of educational practice, , Macmillan Publishing, New York; Engeström, Y., Innovative learning in work teams: Analyzing cycles of knowledge creation in practice (1999) Perspectives on activity theory, pp. 377-404. , Engeström Y, Miettinen R, Punamaki R, (eds), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Eteläpelto, A., Vähäsantanen, K., Hökkä, P., Paloniemi, S., What is agency?

One of the greatest challenges in this transition is the difficulty in changing the knowledge-oriented practices of teachers. This study evaluates the consistency between syllabus design and the requirements imposed by a competence-based learning environment. To make this comparison, the study sets four criteria (C1: explicit relationship between syllabus and graduate profile; C2: precision of the learning outcomes and assessment criteria; C3: contents that mobilise the learning outcomes; and C4: learning and assessment activities) derived from the literature and a thematic analysis of competence-based learning in higher education. Afterwards, a sample of 150 syllabi from different disciplines of five Chilean public universities were analysed, all of which stated the use of learning outcomes and competences in their learning models. Using a three-point Likert scale derived from the aforementioned criteria and their indicators, a comparison was made between the actual practices reflected in the syllabus design and the previously established criteria. Results show a gap between the declaration of a competency-based curriculum and actual syllabus outlines. Moreover, there are important differences among disciplines. Although all disciplines present high levels of accomplishment for Criteria 1 and 3, only the discipline of health sciences presents an acceptable level for Criteria 2 and 4. It is recommended that further research be undertaken towards identifying effective competencybased syllabus design. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.",Chile; competence-based curriculum; criteria; Learning outcome; syllabus,,,"Adam, S., Learning outcomes current developments in Europe: Update on the issues and applications of learning outcomes associated with the Bologna process (2008) Contribution to the Bologna Seminar: Learning Outcomes Based Higher Education: The Scottish Experience, , http://www.ehea.info/Uploads/Seminars/EdinburghFeb08Adams.pdf, February) February 21-22 2008.

This study addresses the association of collective team identification, task interdependence, team learning, and team size, with the implementation of CBE (N = 1008 teachers, 93 teams). Information processing in teams was positively associated with the implementation of CBE. Furthermore, trends revealed that information storage and retrieval, task interdependence, and smaller team sizes were associated with less disagreement within the team about the CBE-level of the educational program. These results provide further insight into the importance of team learning for education reform. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Competence-based education; Teacher teams; Team entitativity; Team learning; Vocational education and training,,Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek,"Bentler, P.M., Comparative fit indices in structural models (1990) Psychological Bulletin, 107, pp. 238-246; Biemann, T., Kearney, E., Size does matter: how varying group sizes in a sample affect the most common measures of group diversity (2010) Organizational Research Methods, 13, pp. 582-599; Biemans, H., Wesselink, R., Gulikers, J., Schaafsma, S., Verstegen, J., Mulder, M., Towards competence-based VET: dealing with the pitfalls (2009) Journal of Vocational Education & Training, 61, pp. 267-286; Bliese, P.D., Within-group agreement, non-independence, and reliability: implications for data aggregations and analysis (2000) Multilevel theory, research, and methods in organizations, pp. 349-381. , Jossey-Bass, San Francisco, CA, K.J.

A set of theoretical and empirical methods was used in the study to analyze and systematize Russian and foreign experience in logistics training of the Spa managers at the University and normative-legal documents relevant for the subject matter of the study. The authors applied interviewing of respondents, monitoring of educational-professional practices; testing of students; methods of mathematical statistics were employed for quantitative and qualitative analysis of the research results. The logistics training for students majoring in ‘Management of organizations (specialization: hotel, resort and tourist business)’ is one of the important elements of the higher professional education system at Russian universities. For graduates in this specialty (managers of the Spa complexes) logistics is not only an academic discipline but also a professional tool of analysis and management of the processes for the provision of a wide range of Spa services. The necessity to form different types of competences (including professional-logistics ones) of the graduates majoring in ‘Management of organizations’ is associated with the transition of the Russian system of higher education to the competence-based training model. The authors of the article analyze the results of the long-term (2003-2015) experimental work in the field of vocational and applied (practice-oriented) logistics training of future managers of Spa resorts. This research has shown that the formed system of professional and logistics competences of the sanatorium complex managers significantly increases their competitiveness and mobility in the labor market, contributes to the successful labor adaptation of young professionals. © 2016 Nikitina et al.",Professional training in the university; Professional-logistics competence; Sanatorium complex manager; Spa services; Students’ logistic projects,,,"Anikin, B.A., (2009) Logistics.

This study examines how students (N=1469) from competence-based and less-competence-based vocational schools perceive their teachers' interpersonal behaviour and its relation with their motivation. Results showed comparable teacher profiles in CBE and less-CBE schools, with an unexpected difference at the dimension level. Perceived teacher interpersonal behaviour moderated connections between CBE and student motivation, with greater impact in less-CBE than in CBE learning environments. Required changes in teacher roles are not yet perceived, hampering the expectations of increased motivation in competence-based education. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Competence-based education; Indonesia; Intrinsic motivation; Teacher interpersonal behaviour; Vocational education,,,"van Amelsvoort, J., (1999) Perspective on instruction, motivation and self-regulation, , Unpublished doctoral dissertation: in Dutch, Nijmegen University, the Netherlands; Biemans, H.J.A., Nieuwenhuis, A.F.M., Poell, R.F., Mulder, M., Wesselink, R., Competence-based VET in the Netherlands: backgrounds and pitfalls (2004) Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 56 (2), pp. 523-538; Biemans, H.J.A., Wesselink, R., Gulikers, J.T.M., Schaafsma, S., Verstegen, J., Mulder, M., Towards competence-based VET: dealing with the pitfalls (2009) Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 61 (3), pp. 267-286; Brekelmans, M., Levy, J., Rodriguez, R., Atypology of teacher communication style (1993) Do you know what you look like?

A phenomenographic analysis using interviews was conducted with three different groups of stakeholders, namely curriculum coordinator, teachers and students at 26 different educational institutions, providing three different types of educational programmes (ICT and Media, Management, Teacher Education). Results suggest that CBE is emerging and that the majority of the institutions designed their education through a mix of traditional and competence-based teaching and assessment methods.

It makes use of lifelong learning and lifelike tasks in realistic settings and requires the cooperation of teachers. This research was prompted by the desire to explain why collegial cooperation often seems to be problematic in schools and universities. Are there certain social structures or behavioural patterns that influence the cooperative culture in teacher communities? The research material was collected in 2013 and 2014 in Oulu, Finland. The target groups were both newly qualified and experienced vocational teachers at all educational levels (N=30). The data collection methods were open questions in interviews and questionnaires. The research approach and analysis methods were qualitative. The theoretical background is in humanistic-cognitive and experiential learning as well as in dynamic epistemic conceptions. The findings show that the prevailing model in teacher communities is individualistic, discipline-divided and course-based, especially among older teachers. The obstacles refer to teachers’ self-image and a deeply rooted fear of criticism or revelation of incompetence. The promoters of cooperation were connected to the changing practices and desire of sharing with colleagues. © 2015, University of Ljubljana.

Focussing on some formative assessment characteristics, this qualitative research intends to study in-depth how student teachers' assessment experiences contribute to their self-efficacy. We interviewed 15s year student teachers enrolled in a competence based teacher educational programme. Thematic content analysis results reveal that the assessment characteristics 'authenticity' and 'feedback' exert a positive influence on student teachers self-efficacy during all phases of the portfolio competence assessment. The results provide a fine-grained view of several types of self-efficacy information connected with these assessment phases. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Assessment characteristics; Assessment experiences; Formative assessment; Self-efficacy; Teacher education; Types of self-efficacy information,,,"Allinder, R.M., The relations between efficacy and the instructional practices of special education teachers and consultants (1994) Teacher Education and Special Education, 17, pp. 86-95; Ashton, P.T., Motivation and teachers' sense of efficacy (1985) Research on motivation in education, 2, pp. 141-174. , Academic Press, Orlando, FL, C.

These formal models are often not integrated with concrete educational activity. On the contrary, this article proposes a practical implementation of the competence approach in education. The model of reference is the Comprehensive Competence-based Education framework, defined for the vocational education and used to analyse the curriculum of some vocational schools in the Netherlands. The framework is here applied to Digital Competence. This specific vocational domain represents the field where the applicability of framework has been tested.

This study explores the face validity, construct validity, and robustness of a competency self-report instrument that is aligned with contemporary competence theory and with current educational practice based on CB-qualification frameworks. A pilot study showed face validity of the competency constructs and indicators according to students from various levels in tertiary education. The results of the principal components analyses and parallel analyses, using data from 351 secondary vocational education and academic students, show more construct validity and robustness for competency constructs that are concrete and easy to relate to specific situations (e.g., ""applying expertise"") compared with the abstract competencies (e.g., ""deciding and initiating"").

Results reveal that student perceptions of the form authenticity aspect and the quality feedback aspect of assessment do predict student self-efficacy, confirming the role of mastery experiences and social persuasions in enhancing student self-efficacy as stated by social cognitive theory. Findings do not confirm mastery experiences as being a stronger source of self-efficacy information than social persuasions. Study results confirm the predictive role of students' self-efficacy on their competence outcomes. Mediation analysis results indicate that student's perceptions of assessment have an indirect effect on student's competence evaluation outcomes through student's self-efficacy. Study findings highlight which assessment characteristics, positively influencing students' learning, contribute to the effectiveness of competence-based education.

The results show that the modular structure has indirect effects on the acquisition of skills through quality teaching and feedback. It is argued that assessment in CBT needs to move away from emphasising more on routine tasks towards the development of broad sets of generic skills and adaptable workforce. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.,Assessment; Competency-based training; Implementation; Skills; Training,assessment method; educational development; implementation process; teaching; training; Ghana,,"Argüelles, A., Gonczi, A., (2000) Competency-based Education and Training: A World Perspective, , Conalep, Mexico; (2003) What Makes for Good Workplace Learning?

CFA results delivered converging evidence for the multidimensionality of the student teacher self-efficacy construct and the bi-factor model as underlying structure, reflecting a teacher competence framework. Factor loadings of the bifactor model evidenced the theoretical assumption that incipient student teachers enter the programme with a global undifferentiated sense of teacher self-efficacy, having teaching experiences a further differentiation takes place to a partly differentiated sense of teacher self-efficacy. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the measure succeeds in predicting students' first-year outcomes and delivered evidence for the diagnostic value of the scale. © 2013.",Competence-based education; Evaluation methods; Student evaluation; Student teacher self-efficacy measure,,,"Allinder, R.M., The relations between efficacy and the instructional practices of special education teachers and consultants (1994) Teacher Education and Special Education, 17, pp. 86-95; Anderson, R., Greene, M., Loewen, P., Relationships among teachers' and students' thinking skills, sense of efficacy, and student achievement (1988) Alberta Journal of Educational Research, 34 (2), pp. 148-165; Ashton, P.T., Motivation and teachers' sense of efficacy (1985) Research on motivation in education: Vol. 2.

The relationships between these variables were analysed in a sample of 894 first-year Dutch university students, using linear structural modelling. Results show that learning process factors play other roles in explaining perceived competence than in explaining earned credits. Perceived competence and earned credits, as two sides of the same coin in competence-based education, are only weakly related. Furthermore, this study shows that it is most likely that perceived competence affects earned credits, but a model in which earned credits affects perceived competence as possible causal relationship was also accepted, although the relationship remains weak. The practical implication of this study is that, as long as perceived competence and the number of credits are not related, competence-based higher education will not obtain optimal efficiency. For participants and researchers in higher education, it remains important to be aware that different learning goals may evoke different study behaviours in students, and the challenge for higher education is to align these goals. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",deep approach to learning; earned credits; motivation; perceived competence; self-regulation,,,"Baartman, L., Ruijs, L., Comparing students' perceived and actual competence in higher vocational education (2011) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 36, pp. 385-398; Boekaerts, M., Self-regulated learning: Where we are today (1999) International Journal of Educational Research, 31, pp. 445-457; Bruinsma, M., Motivation, cognitive processing and achievement in higher education (2004) Learning and Instruction, 14, pp. 549-568; Bruinsma, M., Jansen, E.P.W.A., Educational productivity in higher education: An examination of the Wahlberg productivity model (2007) School Effectiveness and School Improvement, 18, pp. 45-65; Covington, M.V., Goal, theory, motivation, and school achievement: An integrative review (2000) Annual Review of Psychology, 51, pp. 171-200; Dochy, F., Segers, M., Sluijsmans, D., The use of self-, peer and co-assessment in higher education: A review (1999) Studies in Higher Education, 24, pp. 331-350; (2009) The state of education, , Dutch Inspectorate of Education, Annual report 2007/2008.

The implementation of HRM, however, often stagnates. This paper describes a qualitative study - in which 30 policy-makers and executives (members of the board, of the HRM department and line management) from five Dutch VET institutions participated - which was aimed at gaining more insight into the implementation gap of HRM. We identified several impeding and fostering factors, related to the content of the policy, the context in which it had to be implemented and the implementation process itself. Examples of impeding factors were the fact that teachers often did not see the usefulness of HRM practices and managers' incompetence in fulfilling their HRM role. Examples of fostering factors were the linkage between HRM policy and educational policy and a clear communication about the goals and features of the policy. © 2013 Copyright The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.",Human Resources Management; implementation process; professional development; teachers; VET institutions,,,"Åkerlind, G.S., Variation and Commonality in Phenomenographic Research Methods (2005) Higher Education Research & Development, 24, pp. 321-334; Armenakis, A.A., Bedeian, A.G., Organizational Change: A Review of Theory and Research in the 1990s (1999) Journal of Management, 25, pp. 293-315; Arthur, J.B., Effects of Human Resource Systems on Manufacturing Performance and Turnover (1994) Academy of Management Journal, 37, pp. 670-687; Bailey, T.R., Hughes, K.L., Moore, D.T., (2004) Working Knowledge, Work-Based Learning and Education Reform, , New York, NY,: RoutledgeFarmer; Basoski, I., Wiegers, M., Overmeer, V., (2007) De kracht van herontwerp: Onderzoek naar de succesfactoren en risico's van het herontwerp MBO [The Power of Redesign: Examining the Success Factors and Risks of Redesigning VET], , Utrecht: Berenschot; Berger, J., Klein, T., (2002) Monitor integraal personeelsbeleid in de Bve-sector, Eerste meting (2002), Eindrapport [Monitor Integrated Personnel Policy in the VET Sector, First Assessment (2002)], , Leiden,: Research voor Beleid; Biemans, H., Nieuwenhuis, L., Poell, R.F., Mulder, M., Wesselink, R., Competence-Based VET in The Netherlands: Backgrounds and Pitfalls (2004) Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 56, pp. 523-538; Boxall, P., Purcell, J., (2008) Strategy and Human Resource Management, , 2nd ed., Basingstoke,: Palgrave MacMillan; Brockman, M., Clarke, L., Méhout, P., Winch, C., Competence-Based Vocational Education and Training (VET): The Cases of England and France in a European Perspective (2008) Vocations and Learning, 1, pp. 227-244; Browne-Ferrigno, T., Becoming a Principal: Role Conception, Initial Socialization, Role-Identity Transformation, Purposeful Engagement (2003) Educational Administration Quarterly, 39, pp. 468-503; Burchielli, R., The Intensification of Teachers: Work and the Role of Changed Public Sector Philosophy (2006) International Journal of Human Resources Development and Management, 6, pp. 146-160; Clement, M., Vandenberghe, R., Teachers' Professional Development: A Solitary or Collegial (Ad)venture?

In order to provide students with the right competences for the labour market, different subject teachers should work and learn together and, by doing so, should be able to develop changes and improvements to ensure the effective implementation of CBE. In spite of the appeal of forming teacher teams in vocational education, studies on this subject show that teams in educational settings are not easily implemented. This paper aims to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, 28 managers from a Vocational Education and Training (VET) college in The Netherlands were interviewed in order to find factors that are related to effective team functioning. The authors choose to rely on a qualitative approach, because there has hardly been any empirical validation of factors that are related to effective team functioning in a vocational education context. In order to determine what factors influence team effectiveness, the results from the interviews have been related to what is known about team effectiveness from the literature. Findings: By relating the results from the interviews to what is known about team effectiveness from the literature, a framework for future research on team effectiveness in schools is provided. In line with the organisational and psychological literature on team effectiveness, the managers distinguished several aspects in their definition of team effectiveness. Moreover, the findings of the study highlight the importance of the development of task interdependence, transformational leadership, and group efficacy for producing effective teams in education. Originality/value: Although teams and team functioning have been the focus of researchers from different disciplines and have been studied from different perspectives, studies on the conditions that support or limit the successful implementation of teacher teams in vocational education are still scarce. The results of this study are expected to provide a deeper understanding of the mechanism that underlies the ability of teacher teams in vocational education to function effectively. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Education; Team building; Team working,,,"Avolio, B.J., Bass, B.M., Jung, D.I., Re-examining the components of transformational and transactional leadership using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (1999) Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 72 (4), pp. 441-462; Bandura, A., Self-efficacy mechanism in human agency (1982) American Psychologist, 37, pp. 122-147; Basoski, I., van den Hoek, L., Massier, C., (2009) Op weg naar 2010 ... de finale.

This article pictures teaching in innovative, competence-based vocational education in the Netherlands. In a multiple case study, the teaching practices of 10 teachers from five vocational schools were thoroughly studied. By examining not only the actual behaviour of teachers but also their related personal ideas and professional attitudes, we learn about the ways teachers implement new educational concepts and their experienced uncertainties, dilemmas and practical tensions. These insights lead to a better understanding and specification of the concept of competence-based vocational education at the micro level of educational processes, that is, the interaction between teachers and students. Implications are described in terms of new repertoires of teaching behaviour and teaching methods-all in the context of vocational education. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",competence-based education; personal ideas and professional attitudes of teachers; teacher roles; teaching behaviour; vocational education,,,"Aarkrog, V., Learning in the workplace and the significance of school-based education: A study of learning in a Danish vocational education and training programme (2005) International Journal of Lifelong Education, 24, pp. 137-147; Beijaard, D., Meijer, P.C., Verloop, N., Reconsidering research on teachers' professional identity (2004) Teaching and Teacher Education, 20, pp. 107-128; Biemans, H., Wesselink, R., Gulikers, J., Schaafsma, S., Verstegen, J., Mulder, M., Towards competence-based VET: Dealing with the pitfalls (2009) Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 61, pp. 267-286; Billett, S., Knowing in practice: Re-conceptualising vocational expertise (2001) Learning and Instruction, 11, pp. 431-452; Billett, S., Vocational educators: Understanding practice at work (2001) International Perspectives on Competence in the Workplace.

This implies a major shift in educational approach. Previous research has shown which characteristics of learning environments correlate with students' competences to self-direct their careers, but until now this had not inspired intervention studies. Following a baseline measure (reported in Winters et al. 2009), we studied vocational training conversations during the transition to competence-based education in the Netherlands and more specifically before and after a specific teacher training. Results show a significant shift in the organisation of career learning conversations as a result of the teacher training, but also highlight the difficulty of actual behavioural change in educational reform. © 2012 Copyright The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.",career learning; communication; intervention study; mentoring/coaching; reflective learning,,,"Arthur, M., The boundaryless career: A new perspective for organizational inquiry (1994) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 15, pp. 295-306; Baert, H., Dekeyser, L., Sterck, G., (2002) Levenslang leren en de actieve welvaarstaat, , Leuven: Acco; Bailey, T.R., Hughes, K.L., Moore, D.T., (2004) Working knowledge.

In recognition of this, medical educators across the world have recommended the adoption of competence-based education. This is intended to increase the rigour and relevance of the curriculum, move students beyond a focus on the memorisation and regurgitation of scientific facts, and better enable them to understand scientific principles and apply them to the practice of medicine. Experience from 40 years' use of competence-based curricula across the world suggests that the uncritical application of this approach to the medical curriculum may not achieve its intended aims. There are valuable lessons to be learnt from the history of competence-based education. By taking on board these lessons, confronting the pitfalls of this approach, and devising new and creative solutions to the problems inherent in this methodology, medical educators can better achieve their aim of providing a strong foundation for the practice of medicine in the twenty-first century. It is only through such a strategy-rather than the uncritical adoption of this educational approach-that we will have real movement and progress both in competence-based education in general, and in its applications to medicine in particular. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Canada; Competence-based education; Curriculum change; Curriculum development; Curriculum reform; Medical education; Scotland; United Kingdom; United States,"article; attitude to health; Canada; clinical competence; curriculum; human; learning; medical education; methodology; teaching; time; United Kingdom; United States; Canada; Clinical Competence; Curriculum; Education, Medical; Great Britain; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Learning; Scotland; Teaching; Time Factors; United States",,"(2000) Competency Based Education and Training: A World Perspective, , A.

The implementation of these characteristics was examined using a teacher questionnaire and the development of knowledge was investigated using concept mapping. The results showed that students developed slightly more knowledge in learning situations with fewer characteristics of competence-based education. The organisational characteristics of the learning situations were further found to be distinctive for the development of knowledge. © 2011 The Author(s).,Competence-based education; Concept mapping; Knowledge development; Vocational education,,,"Akinsanya, C., Williams, M., Concept mapping for meaningful learning (2004) Nurse Education Today, 24, pp. 41-46; Ausubel, D.P., (1968) Educational Psychology: A Cognitive View, , New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston; Biemans, H., Nieuwenhuis, L., Poell, R., Mulder, M., Wesselink, R., Competence-based VET in the Netherlands: Background and pitfalls (2004) Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 56, pp. 523-538; Bland, J.M., Altman, D.G., Statistical notes: Cronbach's alpha (1997) British Journal of Medical Practices, 314, pp. 572-573; Blumberg, P., Evaluating the evidence that problem-based learners are self-directed learners: A review of the literature (2000) Problem-Based Learning: A Research Perspective on Learning Interactions, pp. 199-226. , D.

Eleven case studies were conducted, including observation of lessons and interviews with teachers and students. The results show that schools meet various fundamental issues in realising this approach. A crucial question is how to stimulate the acquisition and use of a way of knowing and thinking that is based on vocational theory. Reflection, authenticity and coaching are relevant characteristics that are hardly put into practice yet. To understand these results the article reflects on factors that account for the distance between promising concepts and actual teaching practice. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Authentic learning; Competence-based education; Learning activities; Self-directed learning; Teacher roles; Vocational education,,Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek,"Aarkrog, V., Learning in the workplace and the significance of school-based education: a study of learning in a Danish vocational education and training programme (2005) International Journal of Lifelong Education, 24, pp. 137-147; Baartman, L.K.J., Bastiaens, T.J., Kirschner, P.A., Van der Vleuten, C.P.M., Teachers' opinions on quality criteria for competency assessment programmes (2007) Teaching and Teacher Education, 23, pp. 857-867; Biemans, H., Wesselink, R., Gulikers, J., Schaafsma, S., Verstegen, J., Mulder, M., Towards competence-based VET: dealing with the pitfalls (2009) Journal of Vocational Education & Training, 61, pp. 267-286; Billett, S., Knowing in practice: re-conceptualising vocational expertise (2001) Learning and Instruction, 11, pp. 431-452; Billett, S., Vocational educators: understanding practice at work (2001) International perspectives on competence in the workplace.

This study investigates which professional development activities teachers undertake related to this change and how these activities differ among schools with various human resource (HR) policies. Two types of HR policy were involved: (1) a government-enforced, national system of Integrated Personnel Management and (2) a voluntary, integrative approach of Schooling of teachers, Organizational development of schools and teacher training institutes, Action- and development-oriented research, and Professional development of teachers. Semi-structured interviews with 30 teachers in nine schools with different HR policies were held and analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Findings show that teachers undertake professional development activities in five categories: maintaining knowledge base, applying and experimenting, reflection, collaboration, and activities indirectly related to teaching practice. Teachers' professional development activities were found to be relatively similar across schools with different HR policies. It is concluded that neither government-enforced nor voluntary HR policies seem to play much of a role in the participation by teachers in professional development activities. Implications for further research and school practice are discussed. © 2010 The Author(s).",Competence-Based Vocational Education; Continuing Teacher Development; Human Resource Policies; Professional Development,,,"Atay, D., Teacher research for professional development (2008) ELT Journal, 62, pp. 139-147; Beijaard, D., Verloop, N., Assessing teachers' practical knowledge (1996) Studies in Educational Evaluation, 22, pp. 275-286; Bergen, T., van Veen, K., Het leren van leraren in een context van onderwijsvernieuwingen: Waarom is het zo moeilijk?

Competencies are used more and more as the starting point for designing curricula and instructional methods, especially in vocational education and training, to realize authentic and self-steering study programmes. Despite its popularity in both research and educational settings, there is no shared understanding of what competence-based education should look like. Earlier work developed a model for competence-based education that outlines eight features that are important for competence-based education. This paper presents a study designed to determine the extent to which the model for competence-based education can be understood and perceived as useful by teachers in vocational education and training in the Netherlands. The study included 12 teams of teachers in the process of designing or re-designing their study programmes to be more competence-based. Teachers reported that the instrument helped them understand the state of affairs of their study programmes, and empowered them to make decisions about the extent to which they want to make these programmes more competence-based. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Agricultural education; Competence-based education; Curriculum development; Curriculum evaluation; Vocational education,,,"Attwell, G., New roles for vocational education and training teachers and trainers in Europe: A new framework for their education (1997) Journal of European Industrial Training, 21 (6-7), pp. 256-265; Barnett, R., (1994) The Limits of Competence: Knowledge, Higher Education and Society, , (Buckingham, UK: Open University Press); Bastiaens, T., Martens, R., ICT and competence-based education (2003) Competentiegericht Beroepsonderwijs.

Since then, years have gone by, and institutions have acted in order to achieve the competence-based goals. However, have they succeeded in implementing them? This is the research question that is central to the current study. An online survey inquiry was set up in eight elementary teacher education institutions using two questionnaires; one for final year elementary institution pre-service teachers, who were about to graduate at the time of completing the questionnaire (N = 218), the other for teacher trainers throughout the elementary teacher training program (N = 51). Ten years after the decree was issued, results show that competence-based education has become a reality in terms of its implementation. However, the process has not yet come to an end. Whereas some competences are clearly present in the institutions' policies and practices (e.g. teacher as guide to learning and development, teacher as subject expert), others are poorly represented (e.g. teacher as partner of parents, external parties and as a member of the educational community). Moreover, teacher trainers tend to take four different approaches to the implementation of competences (1) during internship, (2) through the institution's policy and program planning, (3) by means of their integration in both theoretical and practical components of the curriculum and finally, (4) a lack of implementation because the competences are considered insufficiently applicable by the teacher trainers. In particular, more experienced and subject expert teacher trainers tend to adopt the final approach more often than do younger colleagues and pedagogues. Student teachers' results, on the other hand, suggest important differences between institutions concerning their understanding of competences and the integration of these competences in the curriculum; suggesting different paces of adaptation between teacher education institutions. Moreover, even within schools, the trajectory towards implementation is not always clear for all members of the teaching team, nor for the students of most teacher education institutions. Consequently, there is still important work to be done in order for successful competence-based change to occur. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Competence(s); Competency-based teacher education (CBTE); Educational change; Elementary; Imposed change; Innovations; Perceptions; Pre-service teacher training; School teacher education; Teacher training,,,"Aelterman, A., Academic teacher education.

It investigates which elements from the cognitive apprenticeship model and from the acquisition and participation metaphors can be identified in the individual action theories of their teachers. Design/methodology/approach: A case study was conducted in one school for vocational education, where 12 teachers engaged in an innovation project around the development of a new competence-based education program for pupils. They participated in concept mapping, cued interviews (based on video recordings), semi-structured interviews, and a joint feedback session. These four sources were used for an in-depth content analysis of teachers' action theories. Findings: No distinctive, crystallized action theories about competence-based vocational education emerged at the individual teacher level; let alone individual teachers' action theories well in line with the two normative frameworks on competence-based education. The case study shows the struggle that individual teachers are going through to get their every-day teaching repertoire more in line with new ideas on competence-based education. Research limitations/implications: Only qualitative data are gathered, in one school, representing one school type, in one country only, limiting the statistical generalizability of the results. Not all respondents are able to participate in all four data sources. Practical implications: Schools should develop HR policies that offer teachers CPD activities in the crucial area of competence-based education; the frameworks presented in the study can be used to this end, by teacher educators as well as by HRD professionals interested in combining training programs with informal employee learning. Originality/value: The study draws on literature from various disciplines (especially educational psychology and HRD), which traditionally have remained mostly separate. It combines insights from four separate data sources. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Competence based training; Continuing professional development; Teachers; The Netherlands; Vocational training,,,"Argyris, C., Schön, D.A., (1996) Organizational Learning II: Theory, Method, and Practice, , Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA; Barnett, J., Hodson, D., Pedagogical context knowledge: Towards a fuller understanding of what good science teachers know (2001) Science Teacher Education, 85, pp. 426-453; Beijaard, D., Verloop, N., Assessing teachers' practical knowledge (1996) Studies in Educational Evaluation, 22, pp. 275-286; Beijaard, D., Verloop, N., Wubbels, T., Feiman-Nemser, S., The professional development of teachers (2000) New Learning, pp. 261-274. , Simons, P.R.J., Van der Linden, J.L., Duffy, T.M.

Box 8130, 6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands","Recent developments in competence-based education have motivated institutions of vocational education and training (VET) to improve the links or connectivity between learning in school and learning in the workplace, which has been a problem for decades. In previous research, a theoretical framework describing the underlying aspects of competence-based education was developed. In this study, three aspects of this framework were used to analyse connectivity between learning in school and learning in the workplace. These aspects were: i) authenticity, ii) selfresponsibility, and iii) the role of the teacher as expert and coach. Three stakeholder groups (i. e., students, teachers, and workplace training supervisors) involved in secondary VET programs in the field of life sciences in the Netherlands were questioned on these aspects. Based on their interviews, it is concluded that these aspects provide information about the process of connectivity. Because stakeholder groups hold different conceptions of workplace learning and often do not communicate adequately about mutual responsibilities, the implementation of these aspects of competence-based education has not significantly improved the connectivity situation. Nevertheless, these aspects of competence-based education can guide stakeholder groups in making clearer agreements about mutual responsibilities, which may improve connectivity in the future. © 2009 The Author(s).",Competence-based education; Connectivity; Life sciences; Workplace learning,,,"(2000) Competency Based Education and Training: A World Perspective, , A.

Results suggest that the potential of the dialogue (or trialogue, as it concerns three parties) is hardly utilised: the communication between student, teacher and mentor from practice is not dialogical and only discusses the most successful way to a degree, but not to a career. © 2009 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.",Communication; Competence-based education; Mentoring/coaching; Research methods,,,"Arthur, M., The boundaryless career: A new perspective for organizational inquiry (1994) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 15, pp. 295-306; Baert, H., Dekeyser, L., Sterck, G., (2002) Levenslang leren en de actieve welvaarstaat, , Leuven, Belgium: Acco; Bailey, T.R., Hughes, K.L., Moore, D.T., (2004) Working knowledge: Work-based learning and education reform, , New York: RoutledgeFarmer; Bardick, A.D., Bernes, K.B., Magnusson, K.C., Witko, K.D., Junior high school students’ career plans for the future: A Canadian perspective (2006) Journal of Career Development, 32 (3), pp. 250-271; Biemans, H., Nieuwenhuis, L., Poell, R., Mulder, M., Wesselink, R., Competence-based VET in the Netherlands: Background and pitfalls (2004) Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 56, pp. 523-538; Blustein, D.L., Applying current theory and research in career exploration to practice (1992) Career Development Quarterly, 41, pp. 174-184; Boekaerts, M., Simons, P., (1993) Leren en instructie: Psychologie van de leerling en het leerproces, , Assen, the Netherlands: van Gorcum; Bruijn, E.D., (2006) Adaptief beroepsonderwijs.

This reform has substantial implications for the roles played by teachers. Yet, little empirical research has been conducted on teachers’ processes of competence development in vocational settings. This study explores teachers’ individual action theories regarding the introduction of competence-based prevocational secondary education. The cognitive apprenticeship model provides a conceptual framework for addressing this issue. The research questions addressed here are: How do teachers value elements of the cognitive apprenticeship model in designing and delivering competence-based prevocational secondary education?, and, What individual action theories do teachers have regarding competence-based prevocational secondary education? The study was designed in two phases. In the qualitative phase, interviews and concept map techniques were used, while the quantitative phase employed a questionnaire. Teachers valued elements of the cognitive apprenticeship model differently, and suggested two additional features: a custom-made educational approach and the professionalisation of teachers. © 2009 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.",Cognitive apprenticeship; Individual action theories; Teachers; Vocational education; Workplace learning,,,"Argyris, C., Schön, D.A., (1978) Organizational learning: A theory of action perspective, , Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley; Atay, D., Teacher research for professional development (2008) ELT Journal, 62, pp. 139-147; Beijaard, D., Verloop, N., Vermunt, J.D., Teachers’ perceptions of professional identity: an exploratory study from a personal knowledge perspective (2000) Teaching and Teacher Education, 16, pp. 749-764; Bottrup, P., Learning in a network: A ‘third way’ between school learning and workplace learning?

The present article reports on the results of an extensive research programme on competence development and CBE consisting of four empirical studies carried out in schools for secondary and higher vocational education in the life sciences in the Netherlands in the years 2004 to 2008. Based on the research findings, the article examines how the CBE pitfalls have been dealt with in Dutch VET. The conclusion can be drawn that the various pitfalls have received attention during the design and implementation of CBE, but not all problems have been solved yet. The article provides clues as to how the various pitfalls might be further addressed in the future to improve the quality of competence-based VET. © 2009 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.",Competence; Competence-based education; Vet; Vocational education,,,"Achtenhagen, F., Grubb, N.W., Vocational and occupational education: Pedagogical complexity, institutional diversity (2001) Handbook of research on teaching, pp. 604-639. , Richardson V., (ed), Washington: AERA; Arguelles, A., Gonczi, A., (2000) Competency based education and training: A world perspective, , Balderas, Mexico: Editorial Limusa S.A. de C.V.

The purpose of this contribution is to review the critical analyses brought forward by various authors in this field. This analysis also remarks on the most important theories and critiques on the use of the competence concept in the above-mentioned states, The systems of vocational education within the four states covered in this study are: the National Vocational Qualifications in England, the approach to learning areas in Germany, the ETED and the bilan de compétences in France, and the implementation of competence-based vocational education in the Netherlands, and these are the respective focal points for the critical assessments of the competence concept presented here. These critiques encompass such aspects as the lack of a coherent definition of the concept of competence, the lack of a one-to-one relationship between competence and performance, the misled notion that employing the concept of competence decreases the value of knowledge, the difficulties of designing competence-based educational principles at the curriculum and instruction levels, the underestimation of the organizational consequences of competence-based education, and the many problems in the field of competence assessment. © 2007 The Vocational Aspect of Education.",,,,"(1999) Een wending naar kerncompetenties.

These “transition” economies still bear much of the legacy of the previous system and culture – academic in orientation, firmly supply led and implemented through vocational schools which are in economic crisis. They are offered the western “consensus” – competence-based training systems and the introduction of common or “core” skills. However, in introducing these methods, approaches and concepts, fundamental flaws appear, flaws that have not been seriously addressed in their countries and cultures of origin. This paper tries to address the problems in dealing with concepts like “competence” and “core skills”, and suggests that we need a coherent, grounded concept of occupational competence to replace the relatively unquestioned “deficiency model” which these concepts represent. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Competences; Core competences; Economic conditions; Skills; Vocational training,,,"Kunzmann, M., Laur-Erst, U., Hoene, H., (1998) Development of Standards in Vocational Education and Training, , European Training Foundation Turin; Mansfield, B., What is competence all about (1999) Competency: The Quarterly Journal, p.

This article provides an historical analysis of the development of competence-based education in various countries and explores the concept of competence and its popularity. Possible pitfalls with respect to the concept of competence, standardisation, school and workplace learning, determining learning activities, assessment of competencies, changing teacher roles/identity and competence-based management will be discussed. Taking these pitfalls into account, roads for future development will be sketched. A learning policy connecting governance, practice and research is believed to be the most fruitful way to develop flexible VET systems that are suited to the emerging knowledge-based economy. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,"Achtenhagen, F., Grubb, N.W., Vocational and Occupational Education: pedagogical complexity, institutional diversity (2001) Handbook of Research on Teaching, , Richardson V., (ed), Washington: American Educational Research Association; Arguelles, A., Gonczi, A., (2000) Competency Based Education and Training: a world perspective, , Balderas: Editorial Limusa S.

Reports research with unemployed adults engaging in vocational training and resulting in four findings. First, while training packages describe assessable outcomes in competency-referenced terms, trainees describe learning outcomes in non-competency referenced terms. Second, vocational trainees describe their learning in terms of dispositional outcomes; that is, in terms of values, interests and attitudes. Third, dispositions can be categorised in terms of maturational concepts. Fourth, trainees made moves towards maturation as a result of CBT/NEIS training over the six-week period of the course. The findings have important ramifications for all future VET/CBT trainees since it is the researcher's formative theory that maturation is a subset of competence in every vocational skill domain. © 2003, MCB UP Limited",Competence based training; Training Packages; Vocational training,,,"Allport, G.W., (1961) Pattern and Growth in Personality, , Gulf Publishing, New York, NY; Anderson, J.R., Acquisition of cognitive skill (1982) Psychological Review, 89, pp. 369-406; Angus, L., Conservative educational reform and Australia's national interests (1992), Deakin University Course Notes, Deakin University, Geelong; Argyris, C., Good communication that blocks learning (1994) Harvard Business Review, pp. 77-85; Auty, G., March of the thought police (1999) The Weekend Australian, Arts/Review, 11-12 September, p. 23; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of personality (1999) Handbook of Personality, , in Pervin, L. and John, O.

It is argued that the prevailing tendency to identify CBET with 'competence' is fundamentally mistaken and that the competence approach is more properly characterised in terms of its philosophically naïve methodological strategy. It is suggested that this strategy is based upon untenable assumptions relating to the semantic status of statements of outcome and the epistemological and ontological constructs to which such statements are intended to correspond.",,,,"Ashworth, P., Is 'competence' good enough?

Describes a number of respects in which the system is failing to meet its objectives. Certain stakeholders are happier with the new approach than others. Also describes the political agenda behind the introduction of competence–based training, and compares the individualist, business–centred policy in Britain with the more collaborative approach in Germany. Britain's policy towards training is consistent with its policy towards the Social Chapter. Concludes that unless the political agenda is changed, regardless of any technical improvements made, retention of the current policy will consign Britain to a low–skill competitive position with respect to the rest of Europe. © 1996, MCB UP Limited",Competences; Europe; Germany; National vocational qualifications; Skills; Vocational training,,,"Education and Training for the 21st Century (1991), HMSO, London; Harrison, R., (1992) Employee Development, , IPM, London; Cassels, J., (1990) Britain's Real Skill Shortage and What to Do about it, , Policy Studies Institute, London; Rose, R., Youth training in a time-space perspective (1991) International Comparisons of Vocational Education and Training for Intermediate Skills, , in Ryan, P.

Yet, according to Whitehead, the ultimate goal of education should be to teach students to learn to apply knowledge. Furthermore, one is confronted with the problem that discipline-specific knowledge and skills are insufficient to respond adequately in a situation with discipline-transcending, new and unknown problems. Next to disciplinespecific knowledge and skills, more general knowledge and skills are needed in the area of e.g., communication, problem-solving, use of information, analysis, decision-making. General knowledge and skills, however, offer no guarantee whatsoever that somebody also has sufficient discipline-specific expertise at his disposal. These are the problems that Nijenrode University wants to solve with a new curriculum for management education. In the curriculum developed by Nijenrode, students learn to apply heuristics in the area of general skills and meta-skills (reflecting and learning-to-learn) in interaction with a varying discipline-specific learning content. In this context, discipline-specific knowledge and skills on the one hand, and general skills and meta-skills on the other hand are, in relation to each other, both the objective as well as the means. The student learns the one thing with the help of the other and vice versa, by means of a continuing process of contextualization and decontextualization. The curriculum is a response to the challenge confronting management education to prepare students for future management positions in a world which is characterized by continuous change. The response may be interesting for other types of vocational and professional education as well. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,,"(1981) The Alverno Curriculum, , Alverno College, Alverno Productions, Milwaukee; (1987) Outcome Measurement Project, , American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, phase III report, AACSB, St. Louis; Andrews, K.R., The role of the instructor in the case method (1981) Teaching by the Case Method, , C.R., Christensen, Harvard Business School., Boston; Ausubel, D.P., (1968) Educational Psychology: A Cognitive View, , Rinehart and Winston, New York; Boyatzis, R.E., (1982) The Competent Manager, , Wiley-Interscience, New York; Brown, J.S., Collins, A., Duguid, P., Situated cognition and the culture of learning (1984) Educational Researcher, 18, pp. 32-42; Brown, A.L., The importance of diagnosis in cognitive skill instruction (1985) Thinking and Learning Skills: Current Research and Open Questions (Vol 2), , S.F., Chipman, J.W., Segal, R., Glaser, Erlbaum, Hillsdale NJ; Bruner, J., (1960) The Process of Education, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge; Bruner, J., (1966) Toward a Theory of Instruction, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge; Butterfield, E.C., Nelson, G.D., Theory and practice of teaching for transfer (1989) Educational Technology Research and Development, 37 (3), pp. 5-38; de Corte, E., Towards powerful learning environments for the acquisition of problem solving skills?
