AB  - This study presented the effect of interactive mathematics (IM) software assisted-teaching on primary three learners' conceptual understanding and performance. The cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML) supported the quasi-experimental design of this study drawing on IM software features that fit a multimedia tool for effective learning. This study used a sample of 138 lower primary learners. Learners' test scores and examples of their work provided data to be analyzed. Learners' conceptual understanding was measured using the percentage of learners who performed a particular item and analyzed using sample learners' work while the overall performance was measured using the mean class scores. From the data analysis, IM-assisted teaching influenced conceptual understanding and performance based on a.05 p-value, the effect size of significance, and learning gains. The analysis of learners' workings revealed different errors in addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication, which were remarkably reduced in the post-test by IM-supported teaching. This evidenced conceptual understanding development by IM-supported teaching. The study suggested the integration of IM in the Rwandan Competence-Based curriculum and its use as an instructional tool in teaching and learning mathematics at the primary level. Besides, it was recommended that Rwanda Education Board support teachers in developing basic computer skills to effectively create and monitor a multimedia learning environment for effective learning. Furthermore, further similar research would improve the literature about interactive technologies in supporting quality mathematics delivery and outcomes. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Nowadays, the growing importance of knowledge management in organizations and educational institutions is evident, given the speed of transformations in society, the market and technology. Faced with the demand for innovation and improvement in employees, such management emerges as a key competence. The objective of this paper is to examine the theoretical foundations of knowledge management and to explore the creation of a knowledge management system in higher education institutions in Ecuador. For this purpose, a qualitative and exploratory methodology was used, based on a literature review and analysis of current trends. The findings highlight the role of knowledge management in organizational competitiveness and its relevance in academia. Higher education institutions need to transform themselves into centers of innovation, fostering continuous learning and playing an essential role in the training of professionals adapted to economic and social demands. It is concluded that knowledge management is fundamental in academia, representing a growing trend to enhance competitiveness. However, this approach implies a paradigm shift towards the active incorporation of knowledge management in these institutions. © Licencia de Creative Commons Atribución 4.0 Internacional (CC BY 4.0) https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.es

AB  - Implementation of the European Higher Education Area changed the assessment model in higher education towards a competence-based system, so that students are assessed by what they demonstrate they can do (competences). However, assessment of certain key competences, such as reading, ceases at higher education. The question remains whether reading competence continues to influence academic achievement at this level. We designed a reading comprehension test based on PISA questions and administered it to new-intake university students. The results were linked to students’ grades in each first-year subject and their sociodemographic administrative data. The influence of reading competence and socioeconomic status on grades in all first-year subjects was analysed through structural equation models. The results show that reading competence at the start of university education has a direct influence on grades in all first-year subjects and an indirect influence through the admission grade. In conclusion, reading competence needs to be further developed and promoted even in the university context. © 2022 HERDSA.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to understand better the student awareness and knowledge on how the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are used in higher education institutions (HEIs) to motivate students’ learning on sustainability. It is essential to consider students’ understanding of sustainability at the end of their studies to assess whether they feel prepared to apply sustainability in their daily work life. Design/methodology/approach: The study has a quantitative case study design, and the specific method used is an online survey with masters’ students using the university student platform EvaSys. The study assesses approaching how students perceive the overall education integrating sustainability into programs and curricula. Findings: The results showed that work-integrated learning (WIL) projects learning and real-life experiences as part of their studies enhanced the students’ understanding of sustainability. Moreover, the study showed that integrating an understanding of the SDGs in teaching offers universities a way to frame students’ key competencies in ways that allow them to develop their interpersonal competencies as ambassadors for sustainability in their future work life. Practical implications: This study supports the argument that WIL and real-life university experiences enhance students’ key competencies critical for sustainability. Originality/value: The pedagogical approach advanced in this paper addresses how WIL and real-life experiences might develop students’ key competencies on sustainability. This approach indicates that working with SDGs in teaching encourages students to promote their interpersonal competencies for sustainability. © 2021, Karin Alm, Thomas H.

AB  - Background: In view of the exponential use of the CanMEDS framework along with the lack of rigorous evidence about its applicability in workplace-based medical trainings, further exploring is necessary before accepting the framework as accurate and reliable competency outcomes for postgraduate medical trainings. Therefore, this study investigated whether the CanMEDS key competencies could be used, first, as outcome measures for assessing trainees’ competence in the workplace, and second, as consistent outcome measures across different training settings and phases in a postgraduate General Practitioner’s (GP) Training. Methods: In a three-round web-based Delphi study, a panel of experts (n = 25–43) was asked to rate on a 5-point Likert scale whether the CanMEDS key competencies were feasible for workplace-based assessment, and whether they could be consistently assessed across different training settings and phases. Comments on each CanMEDS key competency were encouraged. Descriptive statistics of the ratings were calculated, while content analysis was used to analyse panellists’ comments. Results: Out of twenty-seven CanMEDS key competencies, consensus was not reached on six competencies for feasibility of assessment in the workplace, and on eleven for consistency of assessment across training settings and phases. Regarding feasibility, three out of four key competencies under the role “Leader”, one out of two competencies under the role “Health Advocate”, one out of four competencies under the role “Scholar”, and one out of four competencies under the role “Professional” were deemed as not feasible for assessment in a workplace setting. Regarding consistency, consensus was not achieved for one out of five competencies under “Medical Expert”, two out of five competencies under “Communicator”,one out of three competencies under “Collaborator”, one out of two under “Health Advocate”, one out of four competencies under “Scholar”, one out of four competencies under “Professional”. No competency under the role “Leader” was deemed to be consistently assessed across training settings and phases. Conclusions: The findings indicate a mismatch between the initial intent of the CanMEDS framework and its applicability in the context of workplace-based assessment. Although the CanMEDS framework could offer starting points, further contextualization of the framework is required before implementing in workplace-based postgraduate medical trainings. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The present study examines the extent of academic librarians’ teaching, research, communication, and interpersonal skills; key competencies required for the successful implementation of embedded librarianship in Tanzania. A mixed research approach, integrating both qualitative and quantitative approaches, was deployed to guide the collection of data from 166 librarians and 6 directors. Whereas cross-section survey questionnaires were used to collect data from librarians from six university libraries. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were used to collect data from directors. Regarding statistical analysis, descriptive statistics were performed to derive frequencies and percentages from quantitative data collected. The qualitative data were analyzed thematically and presented in narrative form. The findings suggest that librarians’ teaching skills and their knowledge of the research cycle are inadequate, while their communication and interpersonal skills are sufficient to allow them to effectively embed their services in their users’ (researchers, students, and teaching staff) activities. To effectively adopt embedded librarianship, the authors recommend the allocation of adequate funds to support diverse external and in-house training, the development of harmonized library and information science (LIS) curriculum, and the use of social media to interact with users. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In this work, we aim to understand professors’ perception of the key competences as well as the best educational strategies and technological tools to guide digital transformation (DT) in education, according to their experience in emergency remote teaching (ERT). In recent years, technological advancement has driven DT in many areas, with education being among them. ERT due to COVID-19 accelerated this transition. Restrictions and lockdowns forced higher education institutions to adopt remote teaching strategies and tools suited for a digital environment. We surveyed 100 professors from a private Mexican university with 15-month experience of online ERT. We asked them through Likert scale questions to self-evaluate their performance and whether they perceived it to be better in online or hybrid environments compared with face-to-face environments in different aspects. We performed correlation, cluster, and factor analysis to identify the relationships and patterns in their answers. Through open-ended questions, we also asked the participants about the challenges and achievements they experienced, and the educational strategies and technological tools they successfully incorporated during ERT. We also conducted text mining to extract the most relevant information from these answers and validated that they were not polarized with negative sentiment using a large language model. Our results showed social intelligence as an underlying competence for teaching performance was highlighted in the digital environment due to the physical interaction limitations. Participants found success in implementing information and communication technologies, resulting in maintaining student interest and building trust in the online environment. Professors recognized the relevance not only of learning management systems and communication platforms, as expected, but also hardware such as tablets, cameras, and headphones for the successful delivery of education in a digital environment. Technology Enhanced Learning transposes game-based, quizzing practices, and collaborative learning to digital environments. Furthermore, the professors recommended learning-by-doing, flipped learning, problem-based learning, game-based learning, and holistic education as some pedagogical methodologies that were successfully applied in ERT and could be implemented for DT. Understanding the gains concerning teaching learning strategies and technologies that were incorporated during ERT is of the utmost importance for driving DT and its benefits for current and future education.

The paper presents information on the concept of teaching materials supporting professional development of mentors, either teacher trainees trainers or introducing teachers of novice teachers, created within an international project by experts from 6 higher education institutions (Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra – SK, the University of J. Selye in Komárno-SK, Eszterházy Károly Catholic University in Eger-HU, the University of Ostrava in Ostrava-CZ, the Prague University of Economics and Business in Prague-CZ, the University of Novi Sad in Novi Sad – SRB). Methods. Based on analyses of different resources and opinions of experts nominated by the above mentioned higher education institution a mentor competence profile consisting of fifteen key competences was compiled. Based on the platform of the created profile teaching materials supporting successful performance of the mentor role or position were processed. Results. As a main output of the international project 2020-1-SK01-KA201-078250 Mentor training of the Erasmus+ program, five textbooks were created, the basic one in the English version and the other four – its mutations in the national languages of the individual project partners. Conclusion. The textbooks created within the project will be used in the project partner countries within the mentors practical training and preparation. Cognitive value. Currently the concept and philosophy of the teaching materials created within the Mentor training project have become a background for processing further teaching materials supporting mentors´ competence development, which are under preparation within an other international project, namely the bilateral Slovak-Serbian project APVV SK-SRB-21-0025 Mentors´ Vademecum supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency. © 2023, Pro Scientia Publica Foundation.

AB  - In secondary science education, students often do not feel engaged with the scientific concepts that are taught, which hinders conceptual learning. This lack of engagement can be overcome by fictional placemaking. Therefore, the purpose of our design-based research is to explore how the creation and use of fictional places lead to meaningful contexts providing opportunities for the learning of biology. Four design principles were formulated from theories on: (1) pedagogy of place; (2) communities of practice; (3) imaginative teaching; and (4) story-based learning. Based on these principles a lesson series was designed in which students were challenged to create societies living in domes on Mars as a fictional place. This lesson series was conducted in a ninth-grade class (28 students) at pre-university level. It was evaluated on the contribution of the design principles to create a meaningful context for the learning of biology. This research focuses on causal reasoning, which is a key competency in biology. The analysis of artefacts of group work showed evidence that students expressed different types of causal reasoning. Reflection on each of the design principles made clear how fictional placemaking provides opportunities for the development of students’ causal reasoning. © 2023 Royal Society of Biology.

AB  - The Draft Primary Curriculum Framework (NCCA 2020) and the Primary Curriculum Framework in Ireland (NCCA, 2023) identified 'Wellbeing' as a broad curricular area. This study explores the inclusion of outdoor and adventure activities (OAA) in a redeveloped curriculum to support one of the seven key competencies, 'Being Well' (NCCA 2023). Four semi-structured interviews were conducted with expert participants to elicit their views on OAA within a redeveloped curriculum. The findings show that OAA has the potential to foster wellbeing and other competencies, but it is currently neglected due to demands on teachers and a lack of support. These findings suggest that if OAA is to realise its potential, teachers require strong leadership and consistent support to become competent and confident in teaching OAA, underpinned by an understanding of its potential. Further research is needed to track OAA's implementation in schools and its contribution to children's competencies. © 2023 ASPE.

AB  - This study is aimed at exploring Islamic studies teachers’ perceptions about transitioning from objective-based curriculums to competence-based ones, focusing on planning, classroom implementation, and assessment. Also, it aimed to ascertain teachers’ self-efficacy and satisfaction toward the implementation of a competence-based curriculum (CBC). The study utilized a quantitative approach. During the 2018–2019 school year, 180 female middle-school Islamic studies teachers completed a questionnaire that aimed to identify their perspectives regarding various dimensions of transition (planning, classroom implementation, and assessment) created by a CBC implementation. A Kruskal–Wallis’ test was implemented to examine potential differences in self-efficacy among participant responses to the planning, classroom implementation, and assessment dimensions related to age and experience variables. Results showed that participants had higher levels of competence in planning and classroom implementation than assessment when implementing the CBC. The novelty of the CBC and inadequate training were the main impediments regarding its implementation. Participants showed no difference in average scores by either age or experience regarding their sense of self-efficacy in implementing the CBC. The study concluded that teachers are the main cause of failure or success when applying innovative curriculum practices. Islamic studies teachers showed flexibility in embracing the new curriculum and indicated that the application of the CBC was considered a new transition within their educational practices. At the same time, experienced teachers were skeptical of the transition because of their familiarity with the objective curriculum, which they implemented for years, and the insufficient preparations and training before and during the CBC application. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - To perform well in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and respond to rapid social changes, many countries have implemented curriculum reforms. The success of curriculum reform relies on teachers' rational, cognitive and emotional feelings for the challenge of implementation. Teachers' receptivity, growth mindset and grit has an important impact on how they implement new curriculum. In this study, the perspectives of incremental theories of intelligence and teachers’ receptivity theory were used to analyze the effects of teachers’ growth mindset and grit on their receptivity to key-competency-based curriculum reform. Data were collected from 560 teachers working in 112 elementary schools in Taiwan. A total of 402 valid responses were obtained, with the recovery rate being 71.8%. SEM and MANOVA methods were conducted to analyze the collected data. The results revealed the teachers’ growth mindset and grit exhibited strong effects on their receptivity to curriculum reform. Moreover, the existence of significant differences in growth mindset and grit among teachers working at different positions. The findings of this study highlight the importance of the teachers’ growth mindset and grit in promoting a curriculum reform. Therefore, schools’ leaders could create a growth-oriented teaching culture and encourage teachers to establish a professional community for curriculum reform. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Current laboratory-based practical classes are arranged so that all students can complete the required activities on time. With this system there is no incentive for students to optimize the time they spend in the laboratory or have awareness of whether they are conducting the activities in a timely manner. However, the acceptable timeframes for specific basic laboratory procedures within industry are not known. This survey-based study aimed to gain a perception of the employed analytical chemists on the importance of time in conducting practical procedures. The participants were also asked to indicate what duration of time would be acceptable to complete specific basic laboratory practical procedures within industry based on their experience. This was compared to the time that final year chemistry students took to complete basic laboratory practical procedures. Our findings highlighted that time is an important factor in the workplace and should be considered a key competency when preparing analytical chemists. Participants in higher education assumed more time was given in industry to conduct laboratory procedures than those who were working in industry. Students took considerably longer to complete the activities than were perceived to be timely within industry. Speed in conducting practical skills was considered especially important in the pharmaceutical industry. Overall, our findings highlight that working in a timely manner should be considered within an analytical chemistry curriculum and embedded within assessments. Students who aspire to work within industry should have awareness of the importance of generating acceptable data while working in a timely manner. © 2023 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.

AB  - Media literacy is considered one of the key competencies to acquire in the 21st century. With games being recognized as having a large potential to train and educate, a wide range of games focusing on media literacy related topics such as fake news games, digital privacy, personal media habits, and practical media skills have sprung up over the years. All claim to foster media literacy skills and competencies. This begs the question how these games generally frame and understand media literacy, what competencies and skills they actually focus on, and through which game design choices. This paper thus asks: how media literacy games are designed to foster media literacy? Taking the Dutch Media Literacy Competencies Model as a departure point, we answer this question using a thematic analysis of 100 media literacy games and formal analysis of a smaller heterogeneous sample consisting of 12 games. We present a series of key findings involving the prominent presence of certain topics and competencies in the dataset, as well as prevalent design choices, allowing for a discussion of the current landscape of literacy games and underlying competencies and future potential for development.

AB  - Background: Creativity is one of the key competencies for the talent of the 21st century to meet future challenges in a complex world. It is also an innovative basis for students to discover and pose questions. Purpose: This study aimed to explore which two interventions of the problem-oriented teaching model, teacher-guided problem finding (TGPF) and teacher-directed question posing (TDQP), was more effective in terms of improving students’ creativity in STEM education. Sample: A total of 60 seventh-grade students participated in this study. Design and methods: The TGPF group included 30 students who adopted the problem-finding method in which the teacher guided them to find problems, while another 30 students in the TDQP group adopted the method in which the teacher directly posed the questions. The Williams Creativity Aptitude Test (WCAT) was used to test the pre- and post-creativity of the two groups. Paired samples t tests were used to verify whether the two interventions of the problem-oriented teaching model could enhance students’ creativity, and independent samples t tests were used to verify the differences between the two interventions of the problem-oriented teaching model in the enhancement of creativity. Results: The results indicated that both TGPF and TDQP can improve students’ creativity. Compared with the TDQP group, the TGPF group’s students could better improve their creativity, especially in the dimensions of adventure, imagination, and challenge. Conclusion: This study provides references for teachers to use different problem-oriented teaching interventions in STEM education. Teachers should break from the previous approach of direct problem posing to the creation of situations and other methods to guide students to actively think of and discover problems, so as to better improve students’ creativity. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In March 2023, the Department of Education published the ‘Primary Curriculum Framework’ for primary and special schools in Ireland. Reflecting trends in international curriculum reform centred on the needs and priorities of twenty-first century learning and life, the Framework proposes a set of seven key competencies which are presented to underpin children’s learning and development during their time in primary school. In this paper, we focus on one such key competency, ‘being an active learner.’ We aspire to theoretically conceptualise this key competency in relation to the psychological constructs of ‘learner identity’ and ‘learning to learn.’ We argue that such a conceptualisation must not only reflect the cognitive and metacognitive ‘how’ of learning, but also the affective ‘who’ of the learner. Arising from this, we explore Irish primary school children’s perceptions of themselves as learners, drawing on 188 children’s open-ended descriptions of themselves as learners and 136 online survey responses to the ‘Myself-As-Learner Scale’ (MALS). Despite a majority of children describing themselves as learners in positive terms, findings indicate that Irish primary school children report lower mean MALS scores than standardisation data for the scale, with statistically significant differences revealed between genders and class levels. Implications for policy and practice are discussed, as well as opportunities associated with the key competency if meaningfully realised. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Youth have a strong role to play in environmental protection, and we should focus on developing their leadership skills through environmental education (EE). This research aimed to: (1) examine the competencies of environmentally educated young leaders; and (2) design an EE model for young leader development in Thailand. Questionnaires, focus group discussions, and in-depth interviews were conducted to collect data on what participants perceived to be key competencies for environmentally educated young leaders. Next, these data were used to create the EE model for young leader development. Finally, the model was applied to a training program for high school students, and its effectiveness was evaluated based on pre-and post-tests administered on the students. The evaluation results showed that the mean evaluation score rises from a moderate level before evaluation (x = 6.31, SD = 1.70) to a high level after evaluation (x = 8.85, SD = 1.01). The highest mean score is for public benefits (x = 9.06, SD = 1.02), followed by learning (x = 8.87, SD = 0.98), satisfaction on innovation (x = 8.78, SD = 1.02), and pro-behaviors (x = 8.70, SD = 1.02). Therefore, our proposed model can be used as a part of EE in schools for youth leader development. © 2023 Kasetsart University.

AB  - The importance of online learning platforms in the face of the challenges of the 21st century cannot be stressed enough. Multiple approaches based on different didactic concepts and software have already been discussed. At Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, our team supports the development of an innovative digital infrastructure in creating a virtual campus that provides a portfolio of digital skills and key qualifications for students of all disciplines. The following paper presents this open source-based social online learning platform called hocampus: it aims to function as a model approach for future learning platforms connecting unsupervised learning, peer communication and tutoring as well as teaching. However, our platform is not a mere technical architecture that employs online learning and communication possibilities: it is characterized by a strong correlation of structure and content. For this, we advance a didactic concept focused on empowering students to strengthen their cross-disciplinary key competences and 21st century skills. We also depict the digital infrastructure and tools being used in the creating and operation of hocampus. Lastly, the general design principles for digital platforms are put forward. This paper also presents a firsthand account of how to implement such a learning platform by showing what hindrances need to be overcome, how students benefit from a social online learning platform and how digital learning can develop and change in the coming years. Thus, it can function as a manual portraying the necessary steps for the realization of concrete didactic concepts in a digital space. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In many post-colonial African countries, teaching using international languages as the medium of instruction (MOI) places particular challenges with respect to engaging students in learning. This paper explores pedagogical strategies used by Rwandan teachers in primary schools to support their students’ learning subject content when English is the MOI. Findings from 24 interviews and four focus group discussions in four 12-year Basic Education schools indicate that teachers use a rich repertoire of strategies to support students’ learning, which can be clustered into four key themes: (1) communication in an unfamiliar MOI, (2) strategies for visual demonstration (3) strategies for engaging students, and (4) commitment to supporting students with different needs. The implications of these findings are discussed. © 2023

AB  - Creativity is fundamental to the overall progress of humanity and hence identified as a key competence required for being successful in the 21st century. Teaching that nurtures creativity helps not only to unfold children’s creative potential but also to enhance the effectiveness of teach-ing. The essential step in helping teachers to learn the principles of creativity nurturing pedagogy is to measure creativity nurturing behaviour for teachers and develop it through training. Assessment of teachers’ ability to nurture creativity is much needed. In this research we measured the creativity nurturing behaviour of 2006 teachers from various countries across global with creativity nurturing behaviour scale for teachers and analyzed the four-factor model’s reliability, validity and measurement invariance across gender and countries. The following values were obtained: Cronbach’s alpha (0.75, 0.70, 0.72, 0.79), composite reliability (0.76, 0.72, 0.701, 0.784), configural invariance (comparative fit index: 0.913, root mean square error of approximation: 0.063 and standardized root mean square residual: 0.662), metric invariance (obtained value in comparative fit index: 0.912, root mean square error of approximation: 0.061 and standardized root mean square residual: 0.52) and scalar invariance (obtained value in comparative fit index: 0.909, root mean square error of ap-proximation: 0.064 and standardized root mean square residual: 0.7). The results of the study show that creativity nurturing behaviour scale for teachers is a valid and reliable scale which is invariant across gender and countries. Hence, the scale can be administered to measure the creativity nurturing behaviour of teachers and its results can be employed to identify the developmental needs of teachers to foster creativity in the classroom. This first scale for teachers is translated into Hindi, Arabic, Spanish, English, Turkish, and Persian. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Strategic planning is a key competency for business management education. This study designed a dual scaffold-oriented strategy planning board game based on cognitive scaffolding and peer scaffolding and combined it with a real-time checking mechanism using mobile technology. The 68 university students were divided into an experimental group for scaffold game-based learning and a control group for case-based discussion learning to investigate the differences in learning effectiveness, flow and learning anxiety, and to explore the technology acceptance, scaffold usefulness, and activity anxiety of the game-based learning group. The results revealed that the learning effectiveness of the experimental group was significantly improved, while there was no significant difference in the control group; the overall flow and technology acceptance of the experimental group were both relatively high; learning anxiety was significantly reduced in both groups, and the experimental group did not have excessive activity anxiety. There were no significant differences in learning anxiety of the two groups. As for scaffolding usefulness evaluation, the proportion of using peer scaffolding was the highest, and the learners thought that using peer scaffolding was helpful for developing their strategic planning skills. It is suggested that the design of the game mechanism in the future can encourage learners to use the cognitive scaffolding and the mobile-based metacognitive scaffolding more often, and the quality of peer discussions may be improved through the real-time evaluation of the metacognitive scaffolding. © 2023, De La Salle University.

AB  - This paper explores the practical prospects for using artificial intelligence technologies in professional English-speaking translator education. At the online conference ‘Translation Skills in Times of Artificial Intelligence’ (DingTalk platform, January 2022), the teachers of higher education institutions in China prioritized the translator’s competencies necessary for successful professional activity during the digital transformation of social and economic business relations. The educators also evaluated the demand for online services used in the education of English–Chinese interpreters. The survey results showed that the use of artificial intelligence technologies in educational practices could have a significant impact on the development of key competencies of future translators. Using a competency-based approach to interpreter training and considering the need to develop abilities, knowledge, and skills required for successful professional translation activity, the author developed the pedagogical concept of the online educational course ‘Simultaneous and asynchronous translation in a digital environment. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper analysed the responses of 242 civil servants collected during a survey for public authorities personnel with management or executive responsibilities. The survey focused on the perception of respondents regarding the key competencies and the utility of the sustainability development expert occupation (SDE). Based on the assumption that the responses were influenced by multiple factors, the impact of perceptual theory, agency theory and sustainability theory calibrated the analysis of the collected data. Cronbach’s alpha was used to test the reliability of the received responses and multinominal logistic regression with a single dichotomous variable (Regulation Awareness) and several continuous predictor variables (Specialization, Knowledge, Attributions and Competence) was employed to determine to what extent the SDE occupation would contribute to the implementation of sustainable development policies. This paper argues that the ‘green’ competency matrix appropriate for the implementation of sustainable development policies should include executive, compliance promoting, ethical and reporting competencies. The creation of a green competency matrix is an important step toward changing the organisational culture of the public or private sectors to achieve sustainable and reliable development. This research can help organizations and public authorities understand where their efforts should be focused to efficiently incorporate sustainability development into their systems. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Web-conferencing systems (WCS) are gaining momentum in the implementation of distance learning for young people, especially during and after the spread of COVID-19. In this regard, it seems urgent to identify technologies for distance learning education that correspond to modern teacher education to the fullest and are effective, user-friendly and convenient for all subjects of the educational process. This experiment revealed the most popular formats of communication for long-distance students in the implementation of future teachers’ professional training by means of video conferencing on the Zoom platform. The analysis of the implementation of various formats of interaction based on the questionnaire of research participants demonstrated a positive trend in the level of user expectations from educational interaction, technical preferences and students’ attitude to distance learning by means of web-conferencing. The implementation of distance learning using web-conferencing in group and full-class formats of interaction made it possible to increase social presence through the interactive cooperation of the students with each other and with the teacher in the educational and social context. These formats enhance social and cognitive interaction, thus developing key competencies in future teachers related to the ability to implement effective communication when working in a teaching team. It causes an increase in educational efficiency level and is critical, since it allows information to be obtained through interaction with each other and with the content presented on the screen. Thereby, educational distance communication with the help of web-conferencing should be considered as a new form of social and educational communication in the implementation of professional training rather than as a technical non-traditional tool for teacher education. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The current study addresses the problem of retrieving a specific moment from an untrimmed video by a sentence query. Existing methods have achieved high performance by designing various structures to match visual-text relations. Yet, these methods tend to return an interval starting from 0s, which we named “0s bias”. In this paper, we propose a Circular Co-Teaching (CCT) mechanism using a captioner to improve an existing retrieval model (localizer) from two aspects: biased annotations and easy samples. Correspondingly, CCT contains two processes: (1) Pseudo Query Generation (captioner to localizer), aiming at transferring the knowledge from generated queries to the localizer to balance annotations; (2) Competence-based Curriculum Learning (localizer to captioner), training the captioner in an easy-to-hard fashion guided by localization results, making pairs of the false-positive moment and pseudo query become easy samples for the localizer. Extensive experiments show that our CCT can alleviate “0s bias” with even 4% improvement for existing approaches on average in two public datasets (ActivityNet-Captions, and Charades-STA), in terms of R@1,IoU=0.7. Notably, our method also outperforms baselines in an out-of-distribution scenario. We also quantitatively validate CCT's ability to cope with “0s bias” by a proposed metric, DM. Our study not only theoretically contributes to detecting “0s bias”, but also provides a highly effective tool for video moment retrieval by alleviating such bias. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Uncertainty is an inevitable part of medical practice. An ability to tolerate uncertainty is viewed as a key competency across many health-care systems. Poor uncertainty tolerance (UT) has been linked to negative outcomes including reduced psychological well-being in medical students. A variety of medical education interventions have been developed with the intention of increasing medical students' UT. However, there is no synthesis of these studies available to inform education and research practice. Our aim was to conduct a scoping review of medical education interventions that evaluate their impact on UT. METHODS: Medline, PsycInfo, Embase and ERIC databases were searched for articles published from inception to December 2020. An extensive supplementary search was conducted and both quantitative and qualitative evaluations were included. For each intervention, we categorised the stimulus of uncertainty (ambiguity, complexity and/or probability) and mapped the students' reported cognitive, behavioural, and/or emotional response(s) to uncertainty onto an existing conceptual framework. RESULTS: Twenty-two of 24 included studies reported a positive impact on medical student UT in at least one domain (cognitive, behavioural or emotional). Interventions included problem based learning-based curricula, medical humanities, simulation, reflection and assessment. We found in four studies that a negative response in the emotional domain was reported despite positive responses also being reported in the cognitive and/or behavioural domains. CONCLUSION: We identified a range of medical education interventions which report a positive impact on medical student UT. Further research is required to understand why a single intervention may stimulate a negative emotional response alongside a positive cognitive or behavioural response. In turn, this could support stakeholders such as policymakers and institutions to adapt the medical curriculum to better prepare their medical students for practice by enhancing their UT. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Across the globe, the advent of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has propelled most sectors to do their business online. Higher education institutions (HEIs) in particular have had to move their teaching and learning online, with Moodle (modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment) reported to be one of the most used platforms internationally. In the context of Covid-19, educational researchers and publications have discussed various ways in which this platform has influenced the three types of curricula, namely: competence curriculum; pragmatic curriculum and performance curriculum. However, there is less emphasis on ideological-ware in the use of Moodle as a teaching and learning resource, which presents a serious challenge and requires systemic debate and reflection. This study uses critical discourse analysis and community of inquiry through purposive and convenience sampling to identify the published documents on the use of Moodle as a teaching and learning resource in the context of Covid-19. Findings indicate that most scholars are advocating that the successful use of Moodle in higher education institutions relies on ensuring that hardware and software resources are available for both lecturers and students. This suggests that HEIs are focusing on the performance and competence-based curriculum, yet limited mention is given to ideological-ware as an important aspect when using Moodle. © Copyright the author(s); published under a Creative Commons NonCommercial 4.0 License

AB  - Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) approach has become one of the bilingual education pillars worldwide. Its application often relies on quality instruction; therefore, careful preparation of future CLIL educators will guarantee adequate CLIL implementation. Despite the extensive research on the method used since the 1990s, little is known about the competence-based training process of content and language teachers. Through a multi-dimensional perspective of the current research, including qualitative and quantitative methods, the study authors attempt to demonstrate that CLIL competences can be adequately developed. In our project, we taught a postgraduate course on Delivering the curriculum through English to 26 educators and analysed the development of their professional skills. Pilot study results show that competence development is highly correlated with linguistic awareness, in-depth theoretical and applied knowledge of the CLIL approach and mutual support within teaching community. Regardless of the fundamental idea of formative exploration, our study presents some findings deserving of thought by teacher trainers and policymakers currently applying CLIL methodology. © 2023, Kazan Federal University.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this personal vision research is to analyse the characteristics of physical education subject to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the development of competences in university students. The objective is to reflect on how critical and systemic thinking could be mobilised through the contents and methodologies in physical education to promote the SDGs. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual article is proposed in which an active investigation of how physical education could foster critical and systemic thinking has been carried out. For this purpose, articles were selected that have analysed the potential of physical education for sustainability. Databases such as Web of Science, Scopus or Google Scholar have been reviewed through keywords such as “physical education”, “sustainability”, “critical thinking” or “systems thinking”. Findings: Strategies are presented to enable university students to understand the scope of the subject beyond the physical dimension. This study discusses that it is only through such a change of view of the subject that meaningful learning and learning situations that encourage enquiry and active participation can be introduced. Thus, this paper argues that physical education is a unique area of knowledge for mobilising critical and systemic thinking in the context of sustainable development (SD). Consequently, concrete actions are presented for application in physical education teaching that shows direct connections to specific targets of the SDGs. Practical implications: This study presents practical implications for higher education leaders and educational policy designers at the national level, as it would help improve initial and ongoing training programs for physical education teachers, focusing on the development of key competencies for sustainability. Social implications: Physical education has the potential to contribute to the development of vulnerable schools and communities, especially to the health and well-being of children and young people and does not require large financial budgets. Therefore, the recommendations presented in this study can have a positive impact on the well-being of these groups. Originality/value: This document invites reflection on how, through different teaching strategies, we can produce significant learning that contributes to the sustainability of the planet. All this, trying to mobilise critical and systemic thinking and consequently improving awareness for SD. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - We live in a digital age, not least accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is all the more important in our society that students learn and master the key competence of algorithmic thinking to understand the informatics concepts behind every digital phenomena and thus is able to actively shape the future. For this to be successful, concepts must be identified that can convey this key competence to all students in such a way that algorithmic thinking is integrated in the subject of informatics -beyond a pure programming course. Furthermore, based on the Legitimation Code Theory, semantic waves provide a way to develop and review lesson plans. Therefore, we planned a workshop, that follow the phases of a semantic wave addressing algorithmic problems using a block-based programming language. Considering this, we suggest the so-called SWAT concept (Semantic Wave Algorithmic Thinking concept), which is carried out and analyzed in a workshop with students. The workshop was carried out in online format in an 8th grade of a high school during a coronavirus lockdown. The level of algorithmic thinking was measured using a pretest and posttest both in the treatment group and in a control group and with the help of the approximate adjusted fractional Bayes factors for testing informative hypotheses statistically and through a reductive, qualitative content analysis of the students’ work results (worksheets and created programs) evaluated. The semantic wave concept was measured using several cognitive load ratings of the students during the workshop and also statistically evaluated with the approximate adjusted fractional Bayes factors for testing informative hypotheses, as well as a qualitative content analysis of the worksheets. Results of this pilot study provide first insights, that the SWATconcept can be used in combination of unplugged and plugged parts. © 2023 Vilnius University, ETH Zürich

AB  - Lifelong learning (LL), which emphasizes the spread of learning throughout life, is a continuous process that aims to develop or change the competencies that individuals have or want to have throughout their lives. This study focused to investigate the extent to which online information-searching strategies (OISS) and digital literacy (DL) can predict LL competencies. The sample consists of 1658 high school students. The convenience sampling approach was used to select the sample. The dataset was collected using the “Key Competencies Scale in Lifelong Learning”, “Online Information Searching Strategies Inventory”, and “Digital Literacy Scale”. Data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficients, and stepwise multiple regression analysis. The results indicated that DL levels and OISS significantly predicted LL competencies. In predicting LL competencies, it was concluded that the best predictor was DL levels. DL independent variable explained 27.7% of the total variance. Also, it was determined that DL levels and OISS explained 34.2% of the total variance of LL competencies and that independent variables affected the dependent variable at a large level (R2 = .342 > .26). In line with the findings of the research, suggestions were made to determine and increase DL levels and OISS to increase their LL competencies. © 2023, Ozgen Korkmaz. All rights reserved.

AB  - Current higher education is based on a competence development approach including generic competences for the integral development of students. Degrees have been designed based on this paradigm centered on lifelong learning, self-regulated learning strategies and active methodologies in which the student is the core of the formative process, aiming at contributing to develop the key competence learning to learn. In the present paper, strategies for generic competences development and evaluation are discussed in the context of engineering and technical courses and degrees. Challenges in competence assessment as well as alignment of formative assessment, methodologies and learning outcomes are discussed based on a series of experiences. Experience evidence that competence development requires designing activities oriented towards competence development, in which learning outcomes and assessment procedures are clearly defined. The alignment of these three elements is the key for competence development since succeeding in a course by achieving the defined learning outcomes implies succeeding in the acquisition of the generic competences planned. Through the paper it is also discussed that competence evaluation is a challenge for university teachers, for which they will need to be formed and trained, and provided with institutional support. © 2023 TEMPUS Publications.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to test an architectural studio pedagogy that originates from an experiment of a Summer School collaborative design studio, with participation of students, academicians and practicing architects, from seven Universities and five European countries. Design/methodology/approach: This pedagogical method follows recommended education for sustainable development (ESD) model, by linking formal and informal learning, and targeting development of the key competences needed for promoting sustainable progress: participation and collaboration, along with inter- and trans-disciplinarity. Combining active participant observation method with descriptive survey research, the paper evaluates the perspective of a small sample size of 27 participating students, who worked with 15 professors alternately, during a two-week design studio course. Findings: The results indicate that such a form of non-formal education has positive impact on acquisition of targeted competences, confirming the strategic role that non-formal education has in reaching quality education learning outcomes, and advocating for the adjustments of existing curricula towards a more collaborative educational approach in architectural design. Research limitations/implications: The modest sample size presents a limitation in reference to generalization of results, neverthless its data are valuable, particularly within the context of maximizing the development of sustainable development goals (SDGs). Originality/value: This endeavour was a part of an on-going Erasmus + CBHE (Capacity Building in Higher Education) project entitled transforming architectural and civil engineering education towards a sustainable model (TACEESM). Organized non-formal educational model is seen as a testing laboratory that blends a conventional methodology of a design studio with a highly collaborative, international and multi-disciplinary approach. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background In 2012, the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS) embarked on structured competency-based curricula (CBC) for its programmes. Other health profession training institutions continued with their traditional way of teaching and thus causing variability in the competencies of the graduates. We aimed to analyze the experiences of different stakeholders on the implementation of CBC specifically on biomedical sciences by MUHAS to inform the development of harmonized competency-based curricula in three health professional training institutions in Tanzania. Methods We adopted an exploratory case study to analyse the implementation of CBC in programmes of Medicine and Nursing involving MUHAS graduates, immediate supervisors at the employment sites, faculty, and continuing students at MUHAS. Kiswahili guides were used to conduct the in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs). Qualitative content analysis was adopted for analysis. Results From the 38 IDIs and 15 FGDs, four categories of human resources teaching and learning environment; curriculum content; and support systems emerged. Human resources were attributed to the shortage of an adequate number of faculty and teaching skills variation. The curriculum content category was linked to the redundancy of courses or topics, poor sequencing of some topics or courses, and limited time for teaching some essential courses or topics. Training and practice area mismatch, accommodation to students, teaching space, and library were the sub-categories linked to teaching and learning environment. Lastly, support systems related to teaching methods and opportunities for improving teaching and learning were revealed. Conclusion The findings of this study highlight the challenges and opportunities for the implementation of CBC. The solutions to the revealed challenges are beyond the training institutions’ capacity. The latter call for multi-stakeholder engagement including those from the public and private sectors in health, higher education and finance for common and sustainable solutions. © 2023, Dove Medical Press Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Childhood experiences of intimate partner violence (CEIPV) is common, but youth voices are underrepresented in such research, and little is known about what they find helpful in counselling. The purpose of this research was to engage youth with lived experience to address the following questions: (1) What do youth with CEIPV identify as key competencies needed for CEIPV service providers? And (2) How can youth participatory action research (YPAR) (and participatory methods) be utilized to enhance research on CEIPV? This article is focused on the YPAR process and addressing the second research question. Methods: Utilizing a YPAR approach, 12 Canadian youth were engaged as members of the research team to include their voices, perspectives, and experiences in addressing the research questions. Results: Youth researchers highlighted strategies and principles to engage youth meaningfully in YPAR. These were: (1) recognizing and valuing lived experience as expertise; (2) recognizing the diversity in youths’ experiences, skills, and strengths; (3) creating a safe space with no judgement; and (4) having adult researchers committed to the process and not just the outcomes of the research. Conclusions: The YPAR process used in the current study is an example of how youth with lived expertise successfully engage in research. Reflecting on what worked in the current study, youth researchers provided recommendations to improve youth engagement. When safety and relationships are prioritized, and youth feel heard and respected, they note finding value in participatory research to counter the impact CEIPV has had on their lives. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Digital competences are widely regarded as the key competences as defined by various international organizations, such as the European Commission (2018) and the OECD (2022). Given their paramount importance across all facets of contemporary society, a thorough examination of their developmental aspects becomes imperative. The study was conducted at a Chilean state-run university, which stands as the second largest institution in terms of student enrollment. Utilizing a quantitative survey-based methodology, this research study seeks to characterize the level of digital competences among Year-1 students pursuing undergraduate programs. Furthermore, it aims to compare the competence levels of two prominent student groups, distinguished by their distinct secondary schooling pathways, namely, technical-vocational education (TVSE) and scientific-humanistic education (SHSE). For the purpose of data collection, the CompDig-Ped test, aligned with the European framework for digital competences (DigComp), has been employed as the research instrument. The key findings of this study underscore significant disparities in digital competence levels between students originating from SHSE and TVSE secondary school trajectories, with TVSE students demonstrating comparatively lower levels of digital competence. These outcomes are congruent with existing research, which highlights the challenges encountered by technical-vocational secondary education in Chile over an extended period of time. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Oral communication and presentation skills are considered key competencies for many academic fields and professions, including science-related ones. Therefore, it is vital that students are given sufficient class time in the curriculum for practicing public speaking. It is well documented in the literature that video technology can be of valuable aid in enhancing oral skills, and FlipGrid is a relatively new video discussion platform that has become popular for this purpose. The aim of this study is two-fold. First, the literature regarding FlipGrid is explored to understand how educators around the globe use the platform. Second, a case study is presented where FlipGrid is used and evaluated as a tool for practicing and assessing oral science communication. A mixed-method approach was used to evaluate FlipGrid with the participation of 112 students. Findings indicate that although the use FlipGrid in science fields is limited, it can be a useful platform for practicing oral science communication. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Being able to write is a key competency in educational models; therefore, it is important to have a scale to assess writing self-efficacy. Objective: The study evaluated the internal structure, providing evidence of reliability, validity, and factorial invariance of the self-efficacy for writing scale (SEWS) across sex and age in Peruvian schoolchildren. Methods: An instrumental study was carried out on 1,107 Peruvian adolescents (early, middle, and late) of school age. A confirmatory factor analysis was carried out and the factorial invariance for sex and age was evaluated. Results: A good fit was obtained for the total sample (χ2 = 1229.08, df = 101, CFI = 0.997, TLI = 0.997, RMSEA = 0.057 [90% CI: 0.0540.059], and SRMR = 0.029) and presented good α, ω, and H reliability (>0.89). Correlations between another measure of writing self-efficacy (p = 0.76; p <.01), study satisfaction (p = 0.31; p <.01), and burnout (p = −0.12; p <.01) scales supported convergent and concurrent validity. Multigroup factor analysis supported strict invariance for sex and age, for which the SEWS provides evidence of validity and reliability. Discussion: This adaptation of the SEWS is a valid, reliable, and invariant measure that can be considered for assessing self-efficacy for writing in Peruvian high school students.

AB  - This article analyses the features of innovative curriculum design and the associated research activities of primary school students in Ukraine. It is emphasised that the priority is the formation of ‘meta-subject results’ in junior high school students, which can be seen as universal learning activities that will ensure, to a large extent, the success of learning at the next levels of education. Our research has shown the undeniable effectiveness of innovative curriculum design allied to pupil research activities based on project work when compared with traditional methodological approaches to learning. We argue that the increasing demand to develop key competencies in education gives a heightened need for these pedagogical approaches. Moreover, the introduction of project work allows the teacher to form a pedagogical situation in which the student formulates a goal and achieves it whilst developing the key skills that will underpin their wider education. © 2022 ASPE.

AB  - Rapid developments in technology have changed the teaching and learning process. As a consequence, lecturers must innovate in their teaching practices to be effective and efficient. However, there is not enough literature that explains the key competencies for innovative teaching. Research mostly focuses on innovative teaching in general and theoretical perspectives. This article tries to explore the key predictors of innovative teaching practices. Structural equation modeling (sem) was used to examine the research model on a sample of 274 teachers chosen at random. We used an online questionnaire to reach the participants who represent our population (Indonesian lecturers). The result indicates that four competencies (pedagogical, learning, technological, and social competency) significantly predict lecturers' innovative teaching performance. The findings provide important insight for those concerned with promoting innovative teaching skills among the Indonesian lecturers. © 2023 Research Center of Universidad Pedagogica Nacional.

AB  - Background: Education in ECMO starts with basic theory and physiology. For this type of training, self-assessment e-learning modules may be beneficial. The aim of this study was to generate consensus on essential ECMO skills involving various professional groups involved in caring for ECMO patients. These skills can be used for educational purposes: development of an e-learning program and fine-tuning of ECMO-simulation programs. Methods: Experts worldwide received an e-mail inviting them to participate in the modified Delphi questionnaire. A mixture of ECMO experts was contacted. The expert list was formed based on their scientific track record mainly in adult ECMO (research, publications, and invited presentations). This survey consisted of carefully designed questionnaires, organized into three categories, namely knowledge skills, technical skills, and attitudes. Each statement considered a skill and was rated on a 5-point Likert-scale and qualitative comments were made if needed. Based on the summarized information and feedback, the next round Delphi questionnaire was developed. A statement was considered as a key competency when at least 80% of the experts agreed or strongly agreed (rating 4/5 and 5/5) with the statement. Cronbach’s Alpha score tested internal consistency. Intraclass correlation coefficient was used as reliability index for interrater consistency and agreement. Results: Consensus was achieved in two rounds. Response rate in the first round was 45.3% (48/106) and 60.4% (29/48) completed the second round. Experts had respectively for the first and second round: a mean age of 43.7 years (8.2) and 43.4 (8.8), a median level of experience of 11.0 years [7.0-15.0] and 12.0 years [8.3-14.8]. Consensus was achieved with 29 experts from Australia (2), Belgium (16), France (1), Germany (1), Italy (1), Russia (2), Spain (1), Sweden, (1), The Netherlands (4). The consensus achieved in the first round was 90.9% for the statements about knowledge, 54.5% about technical skills and 75.0% about attitudes. Consensus increased in the second round: 94.6% about knowledge skills, 90.9% about technical skills and 75.0% about attitudes. Conclusion: An expert consensus was accomplished about the content of “adult essential ECMO skills”. This consensus was mainly created with participation of physicians, as the response rate for nurses and perfusion decreased in the second round. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The study presents the results of an Action-Research project carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic with Italian teachers of primary, lower and upper secondary schools, interested in monitoring the activity of students in that difficult situation. The purposes of this study were: (a) to demonstrate that the involvement of teachers in the creation of metacognitive tools promotes the use of formative assessment at school; (b) to verify to what extent the use of a metacognitive form makes students more aware of the mistakes made during the test. The results were: (a) teachers showed great enthusiasm in adapting the metacognitive form to their school subject; (b) students pointed out high percentages of appreciation of the form; what is more, a group of students improved in identifying the typology of errors and understood more clearly what they should study in a better way to correct their mistakes; another group noted that their awareness of their strengths in study method had grown; finally, one group highlighted that the skills used during the completion of the form were also useful in other areas of their daily life, not only at school. Both teachers and students appreciated the online version of the tool: the pie charts created automatically by the system, by displaying percentages over typologies of errors made, provided immediate feedback, motivating students more and more. The study shows how much reflection on mistakes can be a source of growth.  © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Classical Association.

AB  - Background: Postgraduate training in general medicine should be oriented on competencies and profession-forming, as is suggested by the German Regulations on Specialist Training of federal and state governments and the Competence-based Curriculum General Medicine. The learnability of general practitioner (GP) roles and the profession-forming orientation of the postgraduate training conditions during the outpatient postgraduate training period were investigated. Methods: A cross-sectional study in questionnaire design was conducted from October until December 2019 among 220 physicians in postgraduate training who were registered at the Association of Statutory Health Insurance-Accredited Physicians in Rhineland-Palatinate for the specialty of general medicine. The GP roles surveyed were based on the “CanMEDS General Medicine” roles. Using indicators created from the didactic model “Cognitive Apprenticeship”, profession-forming alignment of postgraduate training conditions in the GP practices were studied. The data obtained were analysed descriptively. Results: The response of 70 evaluable questionnaires included a gender distribution of 51 female and 18 male family medicine residents. The family medicine residents were almost equally divided between single-handed practices, cooperating practice associations and group practices. Slightly more than half of the female physicians worked part-time, whereas the male physicians were all full-time employees. The roles of “member of an interprofessional team”, “health advocate” and “medical expert” were perceived as learnable by 70 to 90% of the family medicine residents. In addition to approval, varying degrees of indecision and rejection were expressed regarding the learnability of the roles of “teacher/scholar”, “member of a network” and “employer”. A slight majority considered the appropriation of the role of “practice manager” to be critical. Within the survey of profession-forming postgraduate training conditions, the indicators “accessible contact person”, “collegial appreciation” and “assumption of responsibility” were approved by more than 90% in some cases. The indicators “access to GP acting” (approx. 86%) and “resilience” (approx. 71%) also received high approval ratings. However, the indicator “continuous feedback” only received a slight majority of approval. Discussion: GP postgraduate training practices in Rhineland-Palatinate apparently offer suitable educational locations to family medicine residents to acquire a solid basis for professional practising and the skills for patient-oriented communicating of preventive health-promoting contents. Male physicians seem to follow more traditional professional hierarchies. In contrast, female physicians are more receptive to teamwork but tend to be sceptical about adopting a leadership position. The learnability of particular GP roles may benefit from close collaboration with the practice owner, especially in single-handed practices. In addition, the working time model chosen seems to have an effect. Conclusions: It can be assumed that profession-forming postgraduate training conditions predominate in Rhineland-Palatinate GP postgraduate training practices, where the role of “medical expert” also appeared to be learnable in most cases. In some cases the learnability of GP roles was significantly influenced by the factors “gender”, “working time model” and “form of practice”. Consequently, it could have a quality-enhancing impact if these factors were taken into account in the development of measures to realize competence orientation in GP postgraduate training. © 2023

AB  - Education policy ambitions or presumptions in most countries are being accused of turning schools into social factories to supply humanpower to produce commodities. This is apparent bureaucratic education policy imposition on school-actors which promotes class division and conflict in sharing resources. Using the Marxist-critical-lenses, this article aims to interrogate the potential outcomes of adopting-implementing the global policy of competence-based education (CBE). The overarching question is whether CBE empowers the grassroots and-or preserves the old-order? This interrogation is sustained through a longitudinal research protocol that mixes document and survey methods and diverse classes. Cameroon English-speaking general secondary school CBE policy is used as part of global flows. The sample has 19 policies, 361 questionnaires and 20 interviewees randomly drawn from 24 diverse schools. Findings suggest that, transnational actors and ‘boss partners’ often influence education bureaucrats to buy global policy, coerce or coax school-workers to drill students into conforming to work obligations. It is rather like bureaucrats rebrand old policy to retain the status-quo-order, dictate equal costs for all grassroot school-actors with diverse abilities, and give few means whilst overtly claiming to empower them. School-actors embody policy but decry few means while assuming complex roles that lead to few improved academic and real-world outcomes. The article concludes that, education policy with class issues often places individual over collective interests that foretell inevitable mass revolutions in transition to Marxist socialism and communism. It is necessary to continually deconstruct class as ‘an elephant in the room’ whilst empowering grassroot-actors against education and real-world biases. © 2023, Institute for Education Policy Studies.

AB  - Transversal competences are now essential not only for employability but for the well-being of students, and thus for society as a whole. However, these competences are not commonly taught or researched as part of higher education degree programmes. This evidently leads to a gap between ideal teaching goals and what students actually learn in their undergraduate studies. To meet this need, a psychoeducational intervention was designed and implemented in an undergraduate programme in translation and interpreting within the framework of a teaching innovation project. The impact of this intervention was tested on transversal competences such as emotional intelligence and regulation, creativity, psychological distress, and cultural intelligence, among others. This parallel exploratory study compared the effectiveness of two mindfulness-based programmes. In both mindfulness-based training programmes, the preliminary results seemed to indicate an improvement in these transversal competences. Limitations of the study were the design, sample size, and the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of our study led to recommendations for degree programme design as well as a platform for discussion and debate on the relationship between higher education, competence-based training, and social demands. The clinical trial was registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04392869). © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: Traditional teaching strategies are making way for a more collaborative learning style, where students play active roles in their learning process. This work focuses on the discussant role activity in the market research subject in a business administration bachelor's degree as a way of empowering students' role. The discussant activity fosters critical thinking and debate between classmates while also encouraging communication and relational skills. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on expectation-disconfirmation theory, this study analysed students' expectations and perceptions before and after the discussant activity. Data were collected through two surveys carried out in class at the beginning and at the end of the course. Findings: The empirical findings show that interactions in the classroom during the activity contribute to students' final evaluation of the activity and positively affect cross-curricular and subjective learning performance. Originality/value: Activities that recreate real-life experiences help students in the acquisition of certain key competencies related to their future inclusion in the labour market. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Both creativity and self-directed learning (SDL) are key competences for us to survive better in the 21st century. Students’ creativity could be developed when they engage in design activities in an SDL way. Therefore, it is important to uncover the effect of SDL on creativity for better implementing SDL approach to enhance creativity. Although existing studies have shown a link between SDL and creativity, how SDL affects creativity is not well understood. This study aims to identify the relationship between actual SDL behaviors and creative performance, and further quantify the predictive effect of students’ SDL behaviors on their creative performance in design education context. The non-experimental correlational research was adopted, and a total of 193 middle school students in a self-directed 3D design class participated in the study. The results showed that there were significant differences of SDL behaviors between high-level creative performance students and low-level creative performance students. SDL behaviors significantly correlated with creative performance. Moreover, students’ SDL behaviors had significant predictive effect on their creative performance. This study enriches the current understanding of how SDL affects creativity from a behavioral perspective. The findings provide evidence for teachers to implement appropriate and effective strategies in design education by letting students engage in SDL behaviors to improve their creative performance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective: This researchers examined how emerging-adult siblings of people with schizophrenia navigate problem-solving and decision-making. Background: Navigating more complex problems is a critical part of emerging adult development, although it can be complicated by stress, conflict, lack of self-efficacy, and lack of family support. Understanding the development of problem-solving and decision-making of emerging-adult siblings of people with schizophrenia development of these key competencies can aid in understanding how they navigate adulthood while contending with a stressful family environment. Method: In-depth interviews with 23 individuals between 18 and 30 years of age were conducted to explore problem-solving, decision-making, and family relationships. Results: Findings suggest that participants who had supportive family or romantic relationships felt as if they were able to resolve their problems. They were likely to use cognitive strategies or advice from other people to resolve their issues. Participants who experienced a lack of support appeared to have more difficulty problem-solving and decision-making. Conclusion: Emerging-adult siblings of individuals with schizophrenia who had adequate family or spousal/partner support reported being more successful in formulating a problem-solving strategy than participants as opposed to those who felt more isolated. Implications: The study has implications for future researchers, such as the examination of other developmental stages and the need to examine why some emerging-adult siblings were able to develop supportive romantic relationships more easily than participants who had similarly conflictual or ambivalent familial relationships. © 2023 National Council on Family Relations.

AB  - Teacher’s training has become a multifaceted process comprising key competencies of which cognitive and educational competence holds paramount importance. The primary aim of teacher’s training is linked to determining the essence along with differentiating the key elements of the formation of the future teacher’s cognitive and educational competence. This study focuses on the development of a model of future teachers’ educational and cognitive competence in independent work. In pursuit of this objective, the researcher has incorporated a review-based design guided by the interpretivism paradigm involving the meta-synthesis of extant academic literature. The researcher conducted a comprehensive review of the extant literature and seminal work to delineate the essential educational and cognitive competencies that must be demonstrated by the teachers to effectively perform their job roles. The article presents five educational and three cognitive competencies that must be mastered by the teachers for their educational and cognitive competence and to enhance their ability to work independently. The model is proposed to be used by the teaching and educational professionals as a competence-based criterion for the training and assessment of the teacher’s performance in Indonesia. The key limitations and strengths of the study were added together with important recommendations for relevant academics and practitioners. © 2023 Eskisehir Osmangazi University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction. The article concerns research conducted among teachers and principals of primary schools in Poland and the Czech Republic as part of a project co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund and the State budget, We Cross the Borders. The Key Competencies in Teaching and Education project was implemented under the recruitment of the Praděd Microprojects Fund, Priority axis number: 11.4, priority axis name: Coopera-tion of institutions and communities. Aim. The theoretical and cognitive aim of the research was to diagnose the competencies of teachers and principals in critical thinking. The practical-implementation objective of the research was to develop practical recommendations that may be included in the education programs of future teachers and principals. Methods. The research used the method of a diagnostic survey and the questionnaire technique. Data analysis was performed with the use of STATISTICA software. Results. The research results showed differences between the behaviour of teachers and principals in such matters as contact with parents, following the headmaster’s instructions, using innovative teaching methods and self-confidence in everyday work-re-lated situations. The results show statistically significant differences in their declarations of behaviour in a particular situation. From the research, it can be concluded that principals are more interested than teachers in solving any difficult situation to resolve the conflict rather than focusing primarily on the consequences of the situation. © 2023, Adam Marszalek Publishing House.

AB  - The ideal context for competence-based education (CBE) in the global south appears elusive with negative ramifications on both the teacher and the student. Using Ghana as a case study, this article shines light on the research question: What are the contexts and the implications of the contexts in which agriculture is taught on competence-based education? Drawing on a mixed methods approach involving cross-sectional data on 112 students, 238 teachers, and qualitative enquiries involving key informant interviews, and on-site observations. The findings showed inadequate facilities and low enrolment in agriculture. Specifically, 34% of pre-tertiary schools had less than 5% of the total student population offering agriculture. Theory-based pedagogies still dominate contrary to the core principles of competence-based education, culminating in students limited hands-on exposure that demotivates teachers and learners. We recommend the Ministry of Education focuses on competence-based education by increasing funding allocation to address the inadequate facilities, classrooms, and equipment needed for the effective teaching, learning, and the practice of agriculture. This article argues for sustained investment and conscious efforts directed at addressing challenges constraining CBE to allay the myths, drudgery, and low potentials ascribed to agriculture, with an ultimate aim to motivate the youth to pursue agriculture as a career and game-changer in providing self-employment and resolving the high unemployment phenomenon in the sub-region. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - With increasing interest and investment, the shipping industry is witnessing solid development in autonomous operations of vessels and transport networks in various configurations including the Shore Control Center (SCC) concept where command, control, and/or monitoring of ships will take place from the shore. However, detailed competence requirements for the SCC Operator (SCCO) are yet to be established. This study aims to map the competence requirements for SCCOs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with expert informants (n = 10) from four different backgrounds, including academia, regulatory, technology developers and other stakeholders, who were selected through a purposive sampling technique. Results revealed three key competences to develop: (i) System understanding, (ii) Communicational and technical knowledge, and (iii) Maritime competence. Knowledge of regulations, Navigational competence, and Basic engineering knowledge—will also be required. The discussion also highlighted the scope of new regulations and a manning plan for SCC. The author concludes that several modifications of the competence and training requirements will occur during the early functioning period of SSC depending on the technological advancement and operational experiences. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This study investigates cooperative learning educational approaches that support preservice teachers’ (PSTs) academic and social attitudes. The extent of positive interdependence between PSTs during multimodal cooperative physical and mathematical activities was measured using a validated questionnaire on attitudes (academic and social) toward cooperative learning attitudes. The multimodal activities triggered positive PSTs’ interdependence characterized by teaching dimensions such as encouraging learner-to-learner interactions, intersubjective skills, and sociocultural awareness. PSTs believed that the cooperative activities helped to form peer-to-peer relationships among team members, which in turn fostered professional judgments. While social and affective attitudes were rated higher than academic ones, the difference was not significant. Hence, this study emphasizes that the multimodal approaches (based on both mathematical and physical development) triggered deeper social rather than academic attitudes, thus underscoring the importance of promoting key competences and the role they play in sustainable education. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Emotional Intelligence (EI) has been identified as a key competence that helps people to relate with one another easily. As such, EI coupled with IQ makes one a star performer at the workplace. Therefore, students need to possess both EI and IQ. For this reason, a descriptive study was conducted to assess the EI levels of IIT students at IIT (ISM)-Dhanbad, India. The analysis was done in two folds; first, to assess the EI levels of the participants. Secondly, to compare the EI levels of the participants using demographic variables. The purposive sampling technique was used to sample 200 engineering students from various engineering departments. The study results unveiled that students from IIT (ISM) Dhanbad were somewhat emotionally intelligent. Also, when the demographic variables were assessed, it was revealed that gender and age were not statistically significant on EI which means that gender and age does not affect a person’s EI. Albeit, in this study, work experience and family income were statistically significant on EI which implied that a person’s work experience and family income could affect their EI. When the EI levels of these participants are developed and improved, they will thrive and succeed both at the workplace, college and in life as a whole as their EI levels are significantly high. © 2023, Kazan Federal University.

AB  - This research presents the development of a sustainable technical project developed by a group of 1st year baccalaureate students in the subject of technical drawing. This project is developed within the methodological framework established by UNESCO in 2017, which describes the key competences for sustainability. Through the project method applied to the teaching–learning process, students achieved subject-specific competences and five key competences for sustainability, as well as a high level of ownership of sustainability knowledge. In each of the phases, the participants used ecodesign to design an educational space that complies with the three areas of sustainability: environmental, social, and economic. To do this, they used technical tools and ICT programmes and computer aided design, which have improved their digital competence. At the end of the experience, the participants elaborated a questionnaire on the degree of appropriation of knowledge in the field of sustainability. The results show an acquisition of competence in sustainability by the students, an improvement of responsible creativity, as well as a good level of appropriation of knowledge in the field of sustainability. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The introduction of digital information and communication technologies has influenced many aspects of the teaching profession. In addition to their changing use in the classroom, these technologies have strongly impacted the work and professional development of teachers. In this study, which was framed within the R+D+i project DePrInEd, we analyzed the perceptions, beliefs, opinions, and attitudes of teachers on this subject. We conducted a qualitative study through interviews, with a thematic analysis addressing the duality of technology and change. The results indicated that these produced benefits and created difficulties in the teaching task, with the latter being more demanding. Teachers stated that one of the main difficulties they encountered was related to the evolution of students as a result of technology, both in the school and social contexts. This highlights the risk that its extensive use did not lead to the acquisition of other key competencies, including digital and media competencies, in the school environment. Finally, other dimensions that impacted the corporate intelligence of educational centers included the continuous adaptation and mastery of digital competence required by teachers regarding the changes in their tasks, as well as the excessive bureaucratization that technologies have necessitated. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The use of augmented reality games (ARGs) in education has gained increased attention from curriculum developers, teachers, and researchers in the past decade. Research findings show that ARGs can promote meaningful learning environments that foster key competences for the 21st century. This paper presents the design process of “EcoAegean”, an ARG for mobile devices, which was implemented in primary classroom environments to support the development of students’ key competences in the context of sustainability. The game was created using an open augmented reality software platform and its design was based on contemporary theoretical underpinnings regarding the use of such games in educational contexts. In the first section of the paper, we describe the design procedures of the learning scenario as well as the game itself. In the last section of the paper, we offer a set of critical insights on the design and implementation of mobile augmented reality games for the purpose of supporting students’ development of key 21st century competences. © 2023 by authors; licensee CEDTECH by Bastas, CY.

AB  - Lower levels of consumer competency are a major obstacle preventing consumers from benefitting from online shopping. However, the literature provides little information on consumers’ competency in online shopping. Based on the consumption decision-making process model, in Study 1, 12 college students with rich experience in online shopping were interviewed. A three-step coding process was conducted, and the results illustrated the key competencies of online shopping, i.e., product identification, self-control, support for decision-making, and consumer protection. Based on the results of Study 1 and the knowledge-attitude-skill model, Study 2 developed three subscales to evaluate college students’ knowledge, attitude, and skill regarding online shopping in standardized and systematic ways. The validity of the instrument was examined in a sample of 648 college students. Study 3 further examined and demonstrated the quality of the three subscales in a new sample of 494 residents. Moreover, a latent profile analysis (LPA) divided the participants into three groups based on their consumer competency: low-, median-, and high-competence consumers. The findings contribute to the literature on consumer competency and online shopping and have different implications for consumers, the government, and corporations. © Author(s).

AB  - The ability to solve complex problems successfully represents a key competence for students’ educational success and beyond. While strategy application and metastrategic knowledge constitute two underlying components that drive successful complex problem solving (CPS), little is known about how these two facets develop individually and jointly in students over time. In order to address this critical research gap, the present study employed a longitudinal design investigating how strategy application, with a focus on the vary-one-thing-at-a-time (VOTAT) strategy, and metastrategic knowledge evolve in students from grade 6 (t1; age M = 12.22) to grade 9 (t2; age M = 15.27). At both measurement occasions, N = 918 students completed two computer-based assessments, one for CPS VOTAT application, and the other for metastrategic knowledge, each consisting of six items. While initial analyses yielded statistically significant improvements in VOTAT application and metastrategic knowledge from t1 to t2, students appeared to be far from mastering either at both measurement occasions. Furthermore, results from a cross-lagged panel model showed that the two concepts are closely intertwined and mutually influence each other over time. Implications of this mutual development of VOTAT application and metastrategic knowledge in CPS are illustrated with respect to potential applications in educational contexts. The discussion places particular emphasis on how upcoming CPS training programs in educational settings can be tailored to specifically improve both strategy application and metastrategic knowledge in students. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Previous research supporting differentiated instruction (DI) has led to its adoption in different countries as a promising pedagogical framework for addressing diverse learners’ needs. To date, there exists little information on DI from Tanzania especially when competence-based education and inclusion are being embraced. To address this gap, this study explored how Tanzanian teachers perceived DI in their working with academically high-achieving secondary school students. The study was strongly informed by a constructivist research tradition, adopting a multiple case study design. Focus group discussions and interviews were used as data sources and thematically analyzed. The analysis revealed teachers’ limited perceptions of DI, although consonance with the existing literature on DI practices for high-ability learners. After discussing the findings, as conclusion, the article stresses the importance of training teachers on DI to enhance their instructional practices for high-ability learners in Tanzania, along with setting the grounds for future research. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Against the backdrop of rapidly evolving technologies and increasingly complex communications networks, cybersecurity is becoming a key aspect of strategic planning. Protecting information, financial, reputational and other assets from increasingly frequent and sophisticated cyberattacks depends on the ability to develop and continually update a comprehensive, proactive approach that takes into account a wide range of factors. The state of national cybersecurity has become one of the key indicators of the level of development along with «classic» indicators (GDP, etc.). The recently emerged research area of «cybersecurity economics» is constantly being enriched with new knowledge and approaches. The article analyzes the risks to the cybersecurity system at different levels and the main measures to strengthen it, and assesses the dynamics of management trends. Key competencies relevant for professionals in this field are outlined. © 2023, National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics. All rights reserved.

AB  - The initial and continuing training of mathematics teachers continues to be one of the most pressing challenges facing the research community in mathematics education. In this regard, various research agendas have been proposed and developed. Among these, two stand out: the characterization and development of (1) didactic and mathematical knowledge that allows the teacher to favor the management of his classes, and (2) skills necessary for professional practice. Although various models have been proposed to attend to each of these agendas separately, there are no models that allow an explicit integration between the notions of knowledge and teacher competence. On the other hand, various studies show the need to have theoretical-methodological tools that operationalize the categories of knowledge and skills proposed by scientific literature. In this article, the didactic-mathematical knowledge (DMK) model is presented as a theoretical-methodological alternative that allows for both the analysis and the development of essential knowledge and skills for the teacher’s professional practice. In addition, it delves into a proposal of categories and subcategories of professional competencies necessary for teaching. © 2022, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.

AB  - Context and purpose: In a context of land shortage with high rates of land degradation and soil erosion due to unsustainable agriculture practices in Burundi, vocational agriculture education needs to prioritize competencies that enable graduates to be effective change-agents in addressing sustainable agriculture challenges. This study aimed at identifying context-relevant competencies for change-agents to be able to foster sustainable agriculture. Methodology: The paper used the Delphi technique to collect data from 28 experts (comprising of 14 teachers and 14 practitioners). Findings: The findings identified 11 context-relevant competencies that are considered by experts to be most important for change-agents working on sustainable agriculture. The competence ‘facilitator of change’ was found to be most relevant and the recommendation is that it should be prioritized in vocational agriculture education curriculum design. Other competencies, such as innovation and creativity, planning, system thinking, domain expertise, continuous learning, interdisciplinarity, and leadership, were also indicated as highly relevant. The competencies stewardship, self-determination and engagement were considered to be comparatively less important, although still relevant. Practical implications: The findings of this study provide insight so that the curricula of vocational agriculture schools can be designed around forming a competence-based education model toward fostering sustainable agriculture. Theoretical implications: The paper contributes to sustainability competence theory by taking the debate to the domain of vocational agriculture education within the context of Burundi. Originality: The study utilized the Delphi process to capture the context-relevance of sustainable agriculture competencies that need to be prioritized in vocational agriculture education in Burundi. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Critical thinking is a key competence in higher education. However, little is known about the conception that students have of this competence. This study aims to analyze what university students understand by critical thinking and if these conceptions agree with those of university teachers analyzed in a previous study. A total of 263 participants took part in the study. The findings reveal that students tend to consider critical thinking as a competence related to reasoning/arguing and questioning/asking oneself. Also, that students' conception about critical thinking differs from that of teachers. Whereas students tend to consider critical thinking as related to reasoning/arguing, questioning/asking oneself and, to a lesser extent, to acting/compromising. Teachers, on the other hand, tend to consider critical thinking as related to analyzing/organizing and evaluating. No significant differences were found regarding students' gender and academic year. These results highlight the importance of considering students' views when designing the curricula and the learning activities to develop students' critical thinking. © 2023 University of Deusto.

AB  - Digital competence is one of the key competences in modern society. COVID-19 related remote schooling revealed that the level of digital competence for learning is not at an expected level. While schools try to overcome this issue, there is a need to understand the level of students' digital competence by assessing it. However, previous attempts to design a comprehensive digital competence test have not been entirely successful. One of the reasons might be that the focus of these tests has been too general. Therefore, the aim of this study was to create a test for assessing primary and lower secondary school students' digital competence for learning in ten dimensions identified based on earlier studies. This digital competence for learning assessment test (Digitest) was carried out with 836 third to ninth grade students from Estonian schools. IRT analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were conducted to establish the potential of the test to measure digital competence for learning and discover which latent variables can be differentiated with it. The results showed that nine dimensions describing attitudes, skills and behaviours can be distinguished with the Digitest and that the test items have good fit to assess digital competence for learning. However, the study also revealed that two higher-order dimensions of digital competence for learning could be identified: motivational and cognitive-behavioural. Thus, empirical data collected with the Digitest is initiating discussions for assessing students’ digital competence in a holistic way but also more general discussions on the concept of competence. This can help educators put greater emphasis on areas where students need further improvement. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Collaborative problem-solving has been widely embraced in the classroom instruction of critical thinking, which is regarded as the core of curriculum reform based on key competencies in the field of education as well as a key competence for learners in the 21st century. However, the effectiveness of collaborative problem-solving in promoting students’ critical thinking remains uncertain. This current research presents the major findings of a meta-analysis of 36 pieces of the literature revealed in worldwide educational periodicals during the 21st century to identify the effectiveness of collaborative problem-solving in promoting students’ critical thinking and to determine, based on evidence, whether and to what extent collaborative problem solving can result in a rise or decrease in critical thinking. The findings show that (1) collaborative problem solving is an effective teaching approach to foster students’ critical thinking, with a significant overall effect size (ES = 0.82, z = 12.78, P < 0.01, 95% CI [0.69, 0.95]); (2) in respect to the dimensions of critical thinking, collaborative problem solving can significantly and successfully enhance students’ attitudinal tendencies (ES = 1.17, z = 7.62, P < 0.01, 95% CI[0.87, 1.47]); nevertheless, it falls short in terms of improving students’ cognitive skills, having only an upper-middle impact (ES = 0.70, z = 11.55, P < 0.01, 95% CI[0.58, 0.82]); and (3) the teaching type (chi2 = 7.20, P < 0.05), intervention duration (chi2 = 12.18, P < 0.01), subject area (chi2 = 13.36, P < 0.05), group size (chi2 = 8.77, P < 0.05), and learning scaffold (chi2 = 9.03, P < 0.01) all have an impact on critical thinking, and they can be viewed as important moderating factors that affect how critical thinking develops. On the basis of these results, recommendations are made for further study and instruction to better support students’ critical thinking in the context of collaborative problem-solving. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Sustainability competencies enable planners, the public, local communities, academics, and development practitioners to address environmental challenges, better envision the future and devise practical solutions. A key competency in this framework is Systems Thinking, allowing individuals to think comprehensively at different temporal and spatial scales. Among all interested groups, local and Indigenous communities play a significant role in preserving the sustainability of the natural environment and co-producing knowledge based on traditional ecological knowledge. Hence, new approaches are needed to integrate traditional ecological values into competency-based practices to articulate problems and related solutions. This project introduces place-based scenarios rooted in conventional forest management concerning two identified subsets of Bloom’s Taxonomy, Remembering and Understanding, including some competencies necessary for thinking systemically. Overall, 57 participants, including students and staff of the College of Menominee Nation and Menominee community members, in northeast Wisconsin, USA, randomly experienced two visual tools with the same information presented as either: a website with simple 2D images or a 3D virtual tour to investigate which visualization method can help better articulate systems, their components, and behaviors. Participants answered two kinds of questionnaires based on either cognitive mapping or reflection on place-based scenarios. The results show that 3D virtual tour users better demonstrated proficiency in Remembering and Understanding compared to users who experienced the 2D website. Our results thus highlight the potential for 3D virtual experiences to enable sustainability competencies. However, given the observed differences among age and educational groups, future visualization tools and associated research methods should attend to audiences’ competencies, preferences, and comfort, especially among older age groups. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Faced with the national emergency linked to the spread of COVID-19 in Italy, digital technologies have made it possible to carry out the ordinary activities of the various educational agencies through the main tool of Distance Learning (DaD). The intensive use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and the guarantee of accessibility represent an enabling prerogative for current education systems, enriching training in a variety of ways and opportunities which must be accessible to all. ICTs take on a propulsive function for change in schools because they make it possible to affect the school setting, to transform the learning environment by redesigning space, reorganizing time, modifying communication and socialization processes, encouraging, in students, the development of key competencies in digital literacy and media education. Considering the context of a school transformed and renewed by the teaching and training potential of ICT, it becomes central to reconstruct the requests and needs developed by the practitioners of educational policies to cope with the reorganization of teaching methods and times at the time of DaD. Starting from these premises, the paper focuses attention on the social impact (Stern, 2016) of DaD to evaluate: the extent and intensity of the methodological-didactic innovation required of teachers for the organization and conducting remote lessons; the increase—in students—of transversal and digital literacy skills (team working, problem solving, etc.) potentially associated with the use of ICTs; the involvement and collaboration of families in the process of assessing and verifying learning. The reflection is part of a broader research project by the University of Sapienza University of Rome entitled “The social impact assessment of DaD after COVID-19”; a 3 year evaluation research addressed to a typological sample of upper secondary schools in Rome classified on the basis of the Infrastructure and Equipment indicator of the Rav and the social effect of the school (school effect) on the academic performance of students in the tests Invalsi. The evaluation aimed to identify—from the DaD experience—indications useful in re-designing the school's intervention strategy in the phases following the pandemic; for this reason it adopted an analysis perspective that valorized the positive and most successful aspects in the testimonies of the teachers and students involved in the first phase of the research (conducted in May–June 2021). Within the framework of the Positive Thinking Evaluation, the empirical evidence—collected through the administration/conduction of semi-structured interviews, focus groups, online ethnographic observation of the lessons in DaD—will allow us to reflect on some dimensions of success and of particular social innovation for the teachers' teaching practices and the students' learning processes in DaD. In the Positive Thinking Evaluation, success is a positive effect (not just a “good practice”), even an unexpected one, of an activity that has produced a positive change in the context of program implementation.

AB  - Increases in the numbers of older adults with mental health and substance use concerns compel us to identify best practices in training to address these issues. Senior Centers are an ideal location for behavioral health education programs as they are the go-to place for many older adults. This paper describes an online certificate program in Behavioral Health and Aging offered by the Center for Aging and Disability Education and Research at Boston University School of Social Work in collaboration with the National Council on Aging to increase senior center staff knowledge and skills. A total of 228 senior center staff in Illinois, Florida, and Wisconsin completed the online certificate program. There were statistically significant changes in key competencies for all courses based on pre-post assessment. We held key informant interviews to assess the impact of training and participants stated that their knowledge, skills, and behaviors were influenced by the program. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Aim. The paper focuses on the divergence of views of experts from four European educational institutions on key competences, which would become the basis for a successful performance of a mentor position. They should be taken as the key items of a mentor competence profile. Methods. A panel discussion – specifically, a focus group interview as its alternative form – was used to determine how the experts assessed particular competences of the mentor competence profile, i.e. to identify which competences they considered to be the key ones of the mentor competence profile. The panel discussion was led by six focus groups, members of which were experts representing four different countries from six universities: two from Slovakia and the Czech Republic, and one from Hungary and Serbia. Results. The intention of the conducted panel discussion was to find a common view and consensus on the key competences required for a successful performance of the mentor position. However, the results of the panel discussion showed a significant divergence of the opinions on the fundamental mentor competences depending on the country the experts were from. Differences in the views on the issue examined by experts representing different institutions from the same country also occurred, but proved to be inconclusive. Conclusion. Mentoring is currently considered one of the most important means of developing pedagogical competences of future and novice teachers. The results of the conducted panel discussion may contribute to the creation of a platform on which an adequate professional mentor training can be designed. © 2023, Pro Scientia Publica Foundation.

AB  - The “Integrated Development of Key Competences” has been identified as the core idea in education to face competition in the 21st century. Similarly, reform efforts in science education emphasize the importance of integrating scientific practices and disciplinary core ideas. The learning progression (LP) is viewed as a robust tool to facilitate this integrated development. In this study, we integrated learning progressions of energy understanding and scientific explanation into an LP-based intervention to facilitate the instructional design of a middle school energy unit. A quasi-experiment was conducted with 3 teachers and their 184 students to examine the effects of the LP-based intervention on teacher instructional actions and student learning outcomes when compared to traditional instruction. Synthesizing video analysis and pre/posttests, the following results were obtained. (1) LP-based intervention influenced the treatment group’s instructions. (2) The performance of both the treatment and comparison groups of students improved, but students in the treatment group demonstrated a better understanding of energy and were more competent in constructing scientific explanation. The article concludes by discussing implications for the future curriculum design and professional development of teachers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Parents’ expectations affect children’s key competencies acquired from STEM education, and influence their future career development. This study aimed to determine the influence of parents’ expectations on children’s key competencies gained through STEM education, with a particular focus on gender difference. A total of 736 parents (44% fathers and 56% mothers) of children aged 3–12 (50.4% boys and 49.6% girls) participated in a two-section survey and rated the degree of importance of each key competency. Subsequently, exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the potential structure of the STEM-related competencies, and ANOVA was used to gain further insights into the gender difference tendency. Results targeted 10 most emphasized competencies which were clustered into four categories, namely the Innovation factor (Inquiring competency, Creativity competency), the Social factor (Cooperative competency, Expressing competency), the Making factor (Hands-on competency, Problem-solving competency, Anti-frustration competency), and the Learning factor (Thinking competency, Knowledge acquisition competency, Concentration competency). Results also indicated that the parents had significantly different expectations for boys and girls regarding the expressing, thinking, knowledge acquisition, concentration, and hands-on competencies. Fathers’ and mothers’ expectations only differed for children’s anti-frustration competency. These findings provide deeper insights into STEM-related competencies from parents’ viewpoints, and contribute a greater understanding of gender difference in STEM education. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Humanity is facing an unprecedented challenge of climate crises. Rapid changes to the physical environment and living conditions will be accompanied by challenges to mental health and well-being. Consequently, education for sustainable development should also include coping strategies for stress and anxiety. Adding intra-personal skills to the curriculum, such as self-reflection and mindfulness training, could aid in this education. This case study aims to explore the barriers to and drivers for fostering inner transitions through intra-personal skills training and mindfulness. Design/methodology/approach: This case study from Lund University, Sweden, constitutes a critical case for investigating inner transitions in education. Data collection was designed around semi-structured qualitative interviews, to investigate the barriers to and drivers for intra-personal skills and mindfulness in education for sustainable development at all institutional levels of the university. Findings: The results indicate that education for sustainable development already includes elements of introspection, albeit informally. However, there is a lack in a fundamental understanding of intra-personal skills and how they relate to other key competences for sustainable development. To make intra-personal skills training a formal component of the education, it must receive the full support from all levels of the university. Originality/value: The study outlines general recommendations for universities to challenge existing policies while also finding ways to work around them. In the meantime, universities should make intra-personal skills training an informal learning activity. Recognizing that the students’ prior knowledge in this area is a potential asset, universities should collaborate with their students to support student-led intra-personal skills training. © 2023, Frans Libertson.

AB  - Critical thinking is considered one of the key competencies of university students and its importance increases with the effort to develop students’ creativity, independence as well as scientific thinking. For this skill, it is important to have confidence in one’s ability to solve problems, find relevant answers or to formulate defensible conclusions. The aim of the paper was to determine whether academic self-efficacy acted as a precondition for critical thinking in university students. A total of 451 university students were involved in this study. The data were obtained by The Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory and the Academic Self-Efficacy Scale. The results showed that academic self-efficacy predicted all the three dimensions of critical thinking, albeit with a small amount of explained variance ranging from 8.1 to 12.2%. Although the main factor moderating each dimension of critical thinking is the effect of academic self-efficacy, a gender interaction effect was also found, which was more evident for males than females © 2023, Pegem Egitim ve Ogretim Dergisi.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This case study explored the impacts of project-based language teaching (PBLT) on developing high school students’ key competences and the factors influencing the effect of PBLT on improving high school students’ key competences in English as a foreign language. Two English teachers and 75 tenth graders from one middle school in Qingdao, China, were chosen as research participants. An explanatory mixed methods research design was adopted, including self-developed tests, semi-structured interviews, and teacher reflections. The results revealed that PBLT has many positive impacts on developing high school students’ key competences in English as a foreign language, especially on six aspects, noticing and attentive (A-1) and extracting and summarizing (A-3) in the A level, describing and interpreting (B-1) and synthesizing and application (B-3) in the B level, and reasoning and arguing with evidence (C-1) and creating and imagining (C-2) in the C level. Meanwhile, five factors including teacher’s understanding of PBLT, teacher’s ability of designing and assessing the project, teacher’s roles, teacher’s instructions, and students’ interest and motivation were found to influence the effect of PBLT on improving high school students’ key competences in English as a foreign language. Moreover, the study provides important implications for language instructors on better understanding and effectively implementing PBLT in language teaching. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Teachers play an important role in helping students improve their learning and achieve the intended curriculum outcomes. Therefore, it is essential to look at teachers' knowledge, understanding, and perceptions of any educational innovation. The present study aims to examine knowledge, understanding and perceptions of Rwandan science teachers with respect to the competence-based curriculum (CBC) introduced in 2015. The 2015 curriculum framework included features like the rationale for its adoption, the concept of competence, different competences to be developed by learners upon CBC implementation, principles guiding CBC implementation, and cross-cutting issues to be addressed by CBC implementation. This research is a multiple case study that adopted a qualitative approach with interpretivism paradigm. Twelve science teachers from three secondary schools, selected based on their differing teaching experience, participated in the study. Data were collected through semi-structured face-to-face interviews. The data were transcribed and qualitatively analyzed using content analysis. The findings revealed some satisfactory knowledge, understanding and perceptions of science teachers. Further, knowledge and understanding gaps as well as negative perceptions of CBC were identified. Towards the effective and efficient implementation of the CBC, this research suggests appropriate training and establishment of the school community of practices for improving teachers' experience of the CBC. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The programme leader is crucial to the success of a higher education provider’s educational portfolio. However, programme leader development is under-researched and is too often conceptualised in a negative way, as the solution to a problem. Here we adopt a positive approach by undertaking an Appreciative Inquiry with programme leaders to understand their development needs. Our work identifies domains of reward and responsibility intrinsic to the programme leader role. Mapping these against a Competence-Based Higher Education Framework, we propose a holistic model for the academic development of programme leaders. We encourage others to adapt this model to their institutional contexts. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Information competence is essential in professional translation and interpreting. This paper gathers the views of professional translators and interpreters in Spain on information competence, by means of an exploratory qualitative study. A questionnaire composed essentially of open-ended questions was applied to gather data and the qualitative analysis software ATLAS.ti was used to code the results using thematic content analysis methods. The views provided by a sample of professional translators and interpreters (n = 156) on the importance of information competence were collected, together with their recommendations on this key competence for those who are starting their training in translation and interpreting. The study also explores the main information needs highlighted by professionals, the sources of information they use most frequently and how they verify information, and their opinions on the gender perspective (with explicit mention of inclusive language) as part of information competence in professional practice. The results show that professionals consider information competence to be absolutely essential in the framework of translation competence, and recommend reinforcing information literacy training in university undergraduate degree programmes. They have multiple information needs (from terminological to contextual) that make them turn to a wide range of information resources (mainly personal sources and online documentary resources), but they need to strengthen their knowledge for information evaluation. Regarding the gender perspective, professionals practically limit their answers to their opinions on inclusive language and, although most of them are in favour, some resistance is detected. From the diagnosis carried out in this research, opportunities for supporting information literacy instruction in undergraduate degrees and in continuing professional development are identified. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Minecraft Education is a popular digital game-based learning platform designed for use in educational settings. This study explores teachers’ experiences of using Minecraft Education as an educational tool to foster the development of key competencies and skills in students. Semi-structured interviews with Irish primary school teachers (N = 11) were conducted during a national project-based initiative involving Minecraft Education in primary schools called Ireland’s Future is MINE. Thematic analysis identified six major themes: encourages student collaboration, supports creativity, students as active participants in their learning, inclusive educational tool, supports curricular content, and barriers to use. Findings emphasise how the platform can be used in the classroom to support the development of skills and competencies students need to succeed in the future while simultaneously supporting curricular content. In addition, the platform can enable learning conditions that are more inclusive and equitable for all students. External technological barriers to use need to be addressed to realise the full potential of the platform in a classroom setting. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations and implications relating to the use of Minecraft Education in primary school classrooms. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - This study aimed to exhibit a bibliometric analysis of systems thinking (ST) research in the field of science education. A total of 340 articles from 201 sources indexed in the Web of Science database in the years 1991–2022 were used in the analysis. The analysis aimed to provide a review of systems thinking research in science education by identifying the dynamics of research by presenting the periodical process, current situation, and future directions. Research on systems thinking has been acknowledged to demonstrate a significant increase in recent years. Bibliometric data prove that systems thinking research concerning studies in science education exhibits a parallel increase too. This is mainly due to UNESCO’s (2015) declaration of The Education for 2030 Framework for Action. There systems thinking was defined as a key competency among eight competencies for education for sustainable development. Correspondingly, the analysis in this study suggests that systems thinking research in science education is a lively and developing subject in the past decade. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - International organisations have pressed countries to prepare students for the knowledge economy by building real-life competencies into national curricula, and the OECD’s PISA has assessed competencies like collaboration and creative problem solving. But is there really a deficit in competencies that schools must address? This review of empirical studies in anthropology and cultural psychology documents that people learn and practice many key competencies in everyday life. However, the situation affects practice, and school-like assessments are situations ill-suited to eliciting everyday competencies. The inaccurate deficit model and questionable assessments paint a misleading picture of how to solve underemployment in the knowledge economy. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The study deals with the identification of problematic areas within the management of general education high schools in the Slovak Republic and analyses the dependence between the most problematic areas of school management with regard to the length of management practice and the types of managerial training. The questionnaire method was used as part of the research investigation. The research sample consisted of leading pedagogical staff (106 respondents) working at state grammar schools in Slovakia. The analysis of the results has showed that for employees in management positions the area of legal management of the school is primarily problematic. The second most problematic area is economic management. The authors expect that the results of the research will not only contribute to raising awareness of the areas of school management but will also provide additional information about director’s competencies and further encourage the responsible authorities to consider other options for methodical support. © 2023 Mária Pisoňová, Nina Bodoríková, Adriana PoliakováP P& Katarína Adamíková; published by UIKTEN.

AB  - Collaborative online international learning (COIL) is a curricular approach that allows students to collaborate across cultures using various communication technologies. Little is known about the influence of COIL on intercultural sensitivity, a key competency for nursing students to better serve increasingly diverse patient populations. We implemented COIL in undergraduate nursing courses in the United States and Japan and examined its impact on intercultural sensitivity using the Intercultural Sensitivity Scale (ISS) as a pretest and posttest. The results of a paired t-test indicated ISS total scores significantly increased after COIL, supporting its use in nursing education courses.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - The current eco-social crisis includes global challenges such as climate change, environmental degradation and demographic shifts that call for a global response. The European Environment Agency claims that over the next decade, very different answers will be needed to the world’s challenges than the ones provided over the past 40 years to confront the foreseeable global changes. Higher Education Institutions have their own responsibility in training future professionals in cross-cutting key competences for sustainability, which are defined through different frameworks. Considering that current students will need to overcome global challenges, this research aims to identify the ways in which Higher Education Institutions are anticipating the introduction of key competences for sustainability into the curricula of their programs. Specifically, it aims to detect the perception of the heads of three departments and three faculties of two universities in Spain and Portugal about the presence of key competences for sustainability in the selected degrees. For this study, a qualitative research approach was employed. The methodology used involved the application of interviews to departments and faculties heads. The results showed there is a growing interest in sustainability at Higher Education Institutions, but key competences for sustainability were not yet sufficiently valued as competences needed for the students in the future, in particular those linked with the professional world. Further similar research could be conducted at other levels (master’s degree, doctorate). © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Knowledge about gender implications of health is insufficiently integrated into university teaching in Germany. Gender awareness represents a key competence to integrate this knowledge into the medical practice. This study is the first survey of the gender awareness of medical students in a cross-sectional design in Germany. Methods: From April to July 2021, a quantitative cross-sectional survey in an online format using the “Nijmegen Gender Awareness in Medicine Scale” (2008) was conducted at four German universities (Charité Berlin, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, and the University of Cologne) with a varied implementation of teaching gender medicine. Students indicated their agreement or dis-agreement with assumptions and knowledge about the influence of gender in everyday medical practice (gender sensitivity), as well as gender role stereotypes towards patients and physicians (gender role ideology). Results: The 750 included participants showed relatively high gender sensitivity and low gender role stereotyping towards patients and physicians. The curricular implementation of gender medicine in the universities showed a significant influence on the students’ gender sensitivity, as well as on their gender role stereotyping towards patients. Students who reported having taken classes in gender medicine or stated a definite interest in doing so showed significantly higher levels of gender sensitivity. Cis-males showed significantly lower gender sensitivity and significantly higher gender role stereotyping. Conclusion: Implementation of gender medicine in the medical curriculum, attending courses on gender education as well as one’s gender and interest have a significant impact on medical students' gender competencies. These results support the need for structural integration of gender medicine in medical education and gender trainings at medical schools in Germany. © 2023 Wortmann et al.

AB  - Purpose: This study attempts to determine a set of characteristics for each educational component in the competence-based agricultural education system. Design: This study reviewed 95 articles published in four relevant scientific journals to determine the characteristics of a competence-based higher agricultural education system. These characteristics were determined based on competence-based education principles. Findings: The results of this review indicated that, based on the CBE principles, the competencies for agricultural educational components identified in the reviewed articles could be summarized in 22 categories. Practical implications: The main practical implication is that the universities can consider the results of this study as a set of guidelines in the admission of qualified learners and educators, revising curriculum and organizing dynamic learning environment in line with the CBE characteristics. Theoretical implications: The results of this study could take CBE principles one step further in that, determining characteristics of a competence-based higher agricultural education system can be a guideline on how these principles could be implemented in an education system. Originality/value: This study is original because it tries to bring CBE principles as a valuable theory into practice by the agricultural education systems. © 2023 Wageningen University.

AB  - The entrepreneurial initiative is considered a key competence to be developed in secondary education. However, research on the effectiveness of entrepreneurial exposure activities in adolescence still being scarce. The results can be misinterpreted if hidden effects such as sorting and alignment are not considered. The aim of this study is twofold. First, to test for the effectiveness of an entrepreneurial exposure activity developed in a Spanish secondary school. Second, to study the presence of sorting and alignment effects on adolescent population. A quasi-experimental design with a control group is conducted on 225 participant students, 158 were randomly assigned according to a cluster sampling to the intervention group (M = 13.19 ± 0.91 years old, ranging between 11 and 15; 57.6% boys) and 67 to the control (M = 13.33 ± 0.88 years old, ranging between 11 to 15; 59.7% boys). Relevant variables such as entrepreneurial intention, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, attitude towards entrepreneurship, subjective norm, psychological capital, prosocial behavior, and certainty about future studies choices were assessed pre and post-intervention. The entrepreneurship exposure activity involved six sessions where the students in teams were asked to develop an entrepreneurial idea that helps to solve a social problem. The results considering the group means only show statistically significant differences in attitudes towards entrepreneurship. The intervention acts as a buffer for the decline in this variable in the intervention group. Additionally, the analysis verified the generalizability of alignment and sorting effects while assessing entrepreneurial intention in entrepreneurship exposure activities with adolescents. Implications for other vocational orientation activities are discussed. © 2023 Universidad de País Vasco

AB  - Many countries include core competencies in their educational curricula. The purpose of competencies is to ensure a holistic education that equips students with skills to flourish in the twenty-first century. Across the literature on this topic, however, there are limited studies that investigate how primary schools embed competencies into their learning programs. A qualitative case study of one Australian primary school with an established environmentally friendly garden program revealed how gardening as part of the school program provided opportunities for the development of core competencies, in particular the general capabilities of the Australian Curriculum. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Notwithstanding reading comprehension is a key competence in today’s society, many late elementary students struggle with it. In this respect, effective instructional incentives are required to foster students’ reading comprehension. However, appropriate assessment instruments to monitor students’ reading comprehension on a regular basis and to make substantiated instructional decisions are lacking. Therefore, a Reading Comprehension – Progress Monitoring tool was developed, consisting of six parallel tests equivalent in difficulty and length. To this aim, classical test theory analyses, item response theory analyses, and automated test assembly were conducted (n = 3,269 students). Suggestions for future research and practice are discussed. Copyright © 2023 Bogaert, Merchie, Aesaert and Van Keer.

AB  - The pandemic brought a massive shift in traditional education strategies. Educational literature is focusing on case studies for online-learning platforms. This research aims to break down the adaptations in teaching styles and curriculums across different countries due to the worldwide shift towards newer technology and learning mediums to facilitate students. Analyzing aspects like motivation, access to network services, grading schemes, teaching styles, and curriculum changes, this research utilizes a cross-country comparison through existing local research in various parts of the globe to summarize the changes that educational institutions in higher education have incorporated into their syllabi and teaching methods. A survey was carried out at Al Ain university consisting of 174 students and 31 faculty members who rated their motivation levels and satisfaction with online learning vs. traditional methods. This survey revealed various answers showcasing the need for institutional training, student-centered curriculums, and syllabi objectives that need to be predetermined and implemented to foster students’ well-being and interest in the subject matter rather than knowledge acquisition. Moreover, through analyzing different countries’ teaching methodologies, we found that developing key competencies and curriculum objectives with different options and mediums available to students is vital to establish agency for students’ well-being. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In order to cope with globalisation and the growing world of work, educational systems are challenged to improve the quality of education. The use of technology in education attracts the focus of developing countries aiming at raising their educational status to fit the global scale. Therefore, Rwanda education system is promoting the use of ICT in primary and secondary education as an instructional tool. Interactive Mathematics (IM) software for Rwanda was developed to support the effective implementation of the Competence Based Curriculum (CBC) of mathematics in primary level. Designed as quasi-experimental using control and experimental groups, this study was conducted in urban public and private schools to investigate the effect of IM software on grade-5 learners' performance. Considering IM software as a new technology under piloting phase, this study was grounded in TPACK framework with theories of technology acceptance model. Data collected through pre-test and post-test in form of scores were analysed using SPSS 23.0 to compute the statistical effect of the teaching interventions. From results, IM software descriptively showed a greater performance than the traditional class, based on the effect size of significance and learning gains. Using repeated measures ANOVA through the general linear model, it was found that IM improved learners' performance more in public than private schools, although private schools showed a high-performance level at both pre-and post-test stages. Despite that, males’ performance remained higher than females’ although females descriptively improved in post-test. The study suggests conducting qualitative studies that would bring more information about the features of IM in quality mathematics education. ©Authors.

AB  - In the 21st century new jobs have emerged, and also the way we do our jobs has also changed. Therefore, certain competencies have become more crucial, so the question emerges how higher education can prepare graduates for such changes. The study aims to discuss the methodology applied to identify the key competencies relevant in junior human resource management (HRM) jobs in Hungary, which is hoped to bring HRM bachelor programmes closer to employers’ needs. The research incorporated the analysis of the Hungarian competency requirements for HRM higher education, the requirements of the potential employers, based on requirements listed on job portals and during focus group interviews conducted with HRM professionals. The analyses revealed that communication, complex problem solving and digital skills are considered as highly important. The competencies identified provided the foundation of a Q-methodology research into the importance and hierarchy of the required competencies. For the pilot research, HRM professionals were selected from different functional areas, and with different previous professional experiences, ranging from 1 year to several years. The study presents the results as well as the experiences of using the Q-methodology in competency research, and refers to the implications for HRM professionals and HR education policy makers. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - As global neoliberalism continues to take root, States aim to produce linguistically-skilled human capital to gain an advantage within highly-competitive market conditions. With this relationship in view, English language proficiency constitutes a ‘rational’ educational pathway for national and personal-level success within an outwardly meritocratic knowledge economy. Yet, in Japan, as in many other locales, English has been accused of strengthening pre-existing power relations. Accordingly, this inquiry draws on Bernstein’s pedagogic device, to address the nested fields of production, recontextualisation, and reproduction shaping educational practice. Regarding production, normative OECD discourses framing essential key competencies favour an epistemic hierarchy privileging the orthodoxy of free-market capitalism. Through unequal pedagogic reform, meanwhile, the recontextualisation of regulatory discourse limits valued forms of knowledge to learners attending prestigious mass-market institutions. This, in turn, holds implications for reproduction. Through recognition and realisation, the classification and framing of English as a ‘valid’ knowledge privilege students from middle-class households. The appropriation of English as a ‘rational’ contact point for global communication, business, and finance thereby risks obfuscating the socio-economic order determining its practice. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The ongoing process of digitalisation requires teachers not only to use technologies in their lessons to provide high quality opportunities for learning, but also to learn through this format themselves. In recent years, a new competence-based curriculum has been implemented in Latvia, introducing new content and paying attention to self-regulated learning (SRL) as one of the transversal skills. This requires appropriate teacher professional development (TPD) and the implementation of various digital solutions in teaching and learning, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the benefits of online learning and the importance of SRL skills for ensuring sustainable lifelong learning, an online TPD course was conducted to enhance teachers’ knowledge of SRL and self-efficacy in developing students’ SRL skills. The course was attended by 126 teachers of grades 7–12. The research analyses teachers’ self-evaluation of the impact of the online TPD course on their knowledge and skills in developing students’ SRL skills, and data prove that both teachers’ theoretical understanding and competence in developing students’ SRL skills can be significantly improved through this format of TPD. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Informed by the critical theory, this paper contributes to debates on decolonising education as an agenda for a heritage-driven curriculum espoused by the current Zimbabwe competence-based curriculum. It focuses on the “O” level Food Technology and Design curriculum, an area that has not been much explored. The paper challenges visible and subtle hegemonic tendencies embedded in the school curriculum, making it difficult for school graduates to identify with their heritage. Using literature review and policy documents’ analysis, it explores the place of indigenous leafy vegetables in the “O” level Food Technology and Design curriculum. Two observations are highlighted. Firstly, there is limited space provided for indigenous leafy vegetables in the “O” level Food Technology and Design curriculum. Secondly, not much has been emphasised on the nutritional value of indigenous leafy vegetables. To this end, we argue that the “O” level Food Technology and Design curriculum needs to be decolonised if more space is to be provided to indigenous leafy vegetables. To achieve this, advocacy and a deliberate shift towards the inclusion of indigenous dishes and particularly indigenous leafy vegetables in the teaching and learning of Food Technology and Design ought to be foregrounded. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Competence-based education and training (CBE/T) has been implemented in Ethiopia to develop the competences of (future) professionals and to improve their performance. However, empirical evidence that demonstrates the effectiveness of CBE/T is scarce. Positioning the study within the theory of strategic alignment and comprehensive competence-based training, we used the authentic core job task ‘On-Site Helping of Farmers during the Planting of Maize’, of Development Agents as problem context and conducted an experimental-longitudinal research study including multirater performance assessment. The study compared competence development of the Development Agents who received training that could be characterized as ‘High-CBT’ (N = 33) and ‘Low-CBT’ (N = 32). ‘High-CBT’ means that in these training programmes, principles of competence-based training were used more completely than in the ‘Low-CBT’ programmes. Experts rated the competence levels of the Development Agents and Development Agents rated their own competence levels. Both groups did that before and after the training. Individual Development Agent performance was also rated by Trained Assessors. Longitudinally, Development Agent performance data was collected during one production year at three points in time. Development Agent's competence development in the ‘High-CBT’ training condition was higher than in the ‘Low-CBT’ condition. Observations made on each Development Agent's performance by Trained Assessors both in the Farmer Training Centres and in the authentic job situations, generally confirmed better performance of the ‘High-CBT’ group compared with the ‘Low-CBT’ group. The finding contributes to the state of research on the relationship between competence development and performance improvement, which is theoretically postulated although less empirically tested. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - With the rapid changes in globalization and technology advancement, self-directed learning is argued repeatedly as a key competency needed to survive in the twenty-first century. In August 2019, the Taiwan Ministry of Education implemented the new Curriculum Guidelines for 12-Year Basic Education. Being Taiwan’s first official curriculum that promoted self-directed learning, this study contributed to the emerging knowledge of how the introduction of the curriculum guidelines affected students’ readiness for self-directed learning. Three cohorts of high school students from seven schools returned 10,020 valid surveys. The Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS), a reputable instrument developed by Lucy Guglielmino (2000), was used in the study. The results provided a bird’s-eye view of evidence supporting our explanations for the positive, though slight, effect of implementing new curriculum guidelines in fostering self-directed high-school learners. Moreover, the progression of self-directed learning readiness appeared differently among schools and among different demographic associations. We suggest that future researchers both (a) qualitatively explore how specific latent variables were changed in different instructional interventions, and (b) conduct panel studies to advance our understanding of curriculum reform and learners’ self-direction. © 2021, De La Salle University.

AB  - This paper addresses the association between socio-scientific controversies and key competencies in sustainability from science education (SE) and environmental education (EE), specifically in initial teacher training (ITT). It is suggested that new research opportunities are also obtained from the articulation between SE and EE, with those on the factors that affect the development of the key competencies outlined by Wiek et al. (2011) being particularly relevant. In order to verify this proposal, quantitative methodologies were used, which investigate the concepts of socio-scientific controversies and the relative degree of deployment of key competencies for sustainability. In order to achieve this, the BIOHEAD-citizen questionnaire and a case study test evaluated with rubrics were applied to trainee teachers to collect evidence of conceptions of controversies in various topics and the relative degree of development of three competencies, namely, systems-thinking, strategic, and normative competencies. The association of both sets of data was done with linear models, based on the score for each competency as a dependent variable. The best model obtained shows a statistically significant explanation of systems-thinking on the part of two systems of conceptions: socio-environmentally negative and socio-political religious; whereas for the other two competencies (strategic and normative) no independent variable resulted in a relevant model. These results suggest that conceptions are important for the development of key competencies, supporting the importance of a symbiotic relationship between SE and EE, the’implications of which are discussed for ITT. © 2022 PEL, http://www.pensamientoeducativo.org - http://www.pel.cl.

AB  - Need for Innovation: Advocacy is a key competency of Canadian residency education, yet physicians seldom engage with supraclinical advocacy efforts upon completion of training. Objective of innovation: The objective was to equip participants with the knowledge and skills required to engage as physician-advocates in their communities using opinion writing as a tool. Developmental process: We used Kern's six-step framework to leverage a common medical training method, simulation, to teach journalistic skills related to advocacy in our novel “simulated newsroom.” Two emergency physicians with journalism training and workplace experience developed simulated newsroom workshops. The simulated newsroom consisted of participants acting as journalists and the expert facilitator acting as a news editor over two workshops. The participants were encouraged to write and workshop an article with colleagues. Evaluation: Participants were invited to participate in a semistructured focus group and to submit their article for qualitative analysis. Focus group transcripts and written work were qualitatively analyzed to understand acceptability and feasibility and how participants might engage as future health advocates. Outcomes: Twelve participants registered for the workshops and six attended. All six participated in the focus group; four submitted written work. The innovation bolstered participants' confidence in advocacy through the popular press and provided demonstrable skills in opinion writing. Participants valued the workshop as a voluntary component of residency education led by physicians with journalism expertise. Discussion: The simulated newsroom may be an effective mechanism for increasing confidence and competence in advocacy writing. © 2022 Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.

AB  - Background: Several competency frameworks are being developed to support competency-based education (CBE). In medical education, extensive literature exists about validated competency frameworks for example, the CanMEDS competency framework. In contrast, comparable literature is limited in nursing, midwifery, and allied health disciplines. Therefore, this study aims to investigate (1) the completeness of the CanMEDS Roles, and (2) the relevance, formulation, and measurability of the CanMEDS key competencies in nursing, midwifery, and allied health disciplines. If the competency framework is validated in different educational programs, opportunities to support CBE and interprofessional education/collaboration can be created. Methods: A three-round online Delphi study was conducted with respectively 42, 37, and 35 experts rating the Roles (n = 7) and key competencies (n = 27). These experts came from non-university healthcare disciplines in Flanders (Belgium): audiology, dental hygiene, midwifery, nursing, occupational therapy, podiatry, and speech therapy. Experts answered with yes/no (Roles) or on a Likert-type scale (key competencies). Agreement percentages were analyzed quantitatively whereby consensus was attained when 70% or more of the experts scored positively. In round one, experts could also add remarks which were qualitatively analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results: After round one, there was consensus about the completeness of all the Roles, the relevance of 25, the formulation of 24, and the measurability of eight key competencies. Afterwards, key competencies were clarified or modified based on experts’ remarks by adding context-specific information and acknowledging the developmental aspect of key competencies. After round two, no additional key competencies were validated for the relevance criterion, two additional key competencies were validated for the formulation criterion, and 16 additional key competencies were validated for the measurability criterion. After adding enabling competencies in round three, consensus was reached about the measurability of one additional key competency resulting in the validation of the complete CanMEDS competency framework except for the measurability of two key competencies. Conclusions: The CanMEDS competency framework can be seen as a grounding for competency-based healthcare education. Future research could build on the findings and focus on validating the enabling competencies in nursing, midwifery, and allied health disciplines possibly improving the measurability of key competencies. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The technologization of society presents a great challenge for education in the twenty-first century; there is a need to face that challenge to be able to promote quality digital literacy. The use of the teacher’s digital competence in terms of the safe and critical use of technologies is one of the key competencies that can guarantee educational success. The present study analyzes the reliability and validity of the DigCompEdu questionnaire for future teachers within the framework of digital competence improvement. This tool is centered on teacher orientation, with respect to their level of competence, through a self-evaluation of their strengths and needs for improvement in digital learning, according to its different dimensions: digital literacy, communication and collaboration with the organization; search and treatment of data, digital socialization; technological creativity and innovation. For its development, the exploratory and confirmatory factorial analysis (EFA and CFA) technique was utilized via structural equation modeling (SEM). A total of 1659 professors, who are employed at a university in Peru, completed the questionnaire. The analyses that were performed corroborated the reliability and validity of the instrument, as well as the different possibilities guaranteed by the validation method via structural equations. We underline the need to offer training for professors in the area of digital competence and endorse methodologies based on competencies that guarantee the use of valid and reliable tools. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Since decades, nursing education struggles with a persistent gap between the theoretical knowledge offered in the study program and its application in professional practice. To bridge this gap competence-based curricula were developed with instructional designs as authentic learning contexts and self-directed learning. In this project we explored final year Bachelor Nursing (BN) students’ experiences in learning in a newly developed curriculum, and their knowledge quality outcomes and the degree of agreement with knowledge requirements. An instrumental multiple case study was conducted with interviews, concept mapping and a domain knowledge list. Results show that a third of the participants had positive learning experiences and got high appraisals for their knowledge quality. Similar to the medium and low scoring participants, they developed instrumental knowledge but integrated other forms of learning into a system of meaning, which is needed to solve non-routine problems in future practice. Medium and low scoring participants did not profit from learning in authentic contexts and self-directed learning. In conclusion, developing sufficient professional knowledge in a constructivist competence-based curriculum is influenced by students’ intrinsic motivation to build a strong knowledge base, by their perception of how to learn and use professional knowledge, and their expectations of the degree of supervision and guidance by the teacher. It is recommended to evaluate the extent to which the intended curriculum is being taught. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - With weather-related natural hazards increasing in number and severity, it is more important than ever for communities to prepare for all types of hazards. However, the literature does not reveal what such preparedness looks like – how much preparation is enough and, conversely, how low levels of preparation can be easily recognised by emergency agencies. This study maps Australian emergency agency understanding of competencies that are needed by individuals and communities for effective preparation. Using in-depth semi-structured interviews of 30 emergency agency, local council and not-for-profit organisation staff from all Australian states, participants identified a range of community and individual features that they had seen in un-prepared and well-prepared communities and which they believed were key competencies for protective action. These competencies were then mapped against participants’ perceptions of five different levels of preparation, resulting in a Preparedness Competency Index that allows agencies to benchmark preparation in communities, as well as to recognise when lack of preparation competency leaves groups vulnerable. © 2022

AB  - In this study, the understanding of self-regulated learning as one of the key competences in contemporary education was based on Pintrich’s model of self-regulated learning. The goal was to examine the links between different motivational orientations and learning strategies among university students in Serbia and explore the relations between these variables on the one hand and academic achievement, gender, field of study, and year of study on the other. A total of 520 students enrolled in art, science, and social science studies at universities in Belgrade, Novi Sad, Niš, and Kragujevac filled out the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). The obtained data were processed via a factor analysis, correlations, and non-parametric tests. We isolated six factors, including Self-Confidence and Orientation Towards Understanding, Elaboration and Metacognitive Self-Regulation Strategies, Critical Thinking and Orientation Towards Expanding Knowledge, Orientation Towards External Criteria Accompanied by SelfDiscipline, Anxiety, and High Learning Motivation and Dedication to Achieving the Set Goals. The application of metacognitive self-regulation strategies could be linked to both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Students oriented towards external criteria exhibited higher levels of academic achievement. We identified gender differences in the application of elaboration and metacognitive self-regulation strategies in terms of learning motivation and anxiety levels. Art students were more prone to the use of the critical thinking strategy compared to science and social science students. In this paper, we highlight practical implications related to designing self-regulated learning courses for university teachers and students, along with recommendations for future research. © 2022, Institute for Educational Research.

AB  - The article describes a pedagogical research, conducted to determine the benefits of Competence Based Training (CBT) as part of a more general paradigm for Competence based education (CBE), in the modules related to Algorithms and data structures (ADS) in the profession of "Application programmer (occupation “Application programmer”). For the purposes of the study, CBT was conducted in several groups under the National Program "IT Career Training" (NPITC). A comparison was made with groups from the regular form of training in the same profession, where a traditional approach to education is applied. The results of the study show that the implementation of CBE under the National Program "IT Career Training" provides no worse training than the traditional approach used in vocational schools. Even in the study area of Algorithms and data structures, the experimental group showed significantly better results than the control group, which means achieving a higher level of acquiring knowledge and skills, as well as more successful formation of specific competencies to work with ADS and application of the paradigms FPS (Functional programming style) and OOP (Objectoriented programming). © 2022 Muharem Mollov & Gencho Stoitsov; published by UIKTEN.

AB  - Background: Self-regulated learning is a key competence to engage in lifelong learning. Research increasingly acknowledges that medical students in clerkships need others to regulate their learning. The concept of “co-regulated learning” captures this act of regulating one’s learning by interacting with others. To effectively cultivate such skills in students, we need to increase our understanding of co-regulated learning. This study aimed to identify the purposes for which students in different phases of clinical training engage others in their networks to regulate their learning. Methods: In this social network study, we administered a questionnaire to 403 medical students during clinical clerkships (65.5% response rate). The questionnaire probed into the composition of students’ co-regulatory networks and the purpose for which they engaged others in specified self-regulated learning activities. We calculated the proportion of students that engaged others in their networks for each regulatory activity. Additionally, we conducted ANOVAs to examine whether first-, second-, and third-year students differed in how they used their networks to support self-regulation. Results: Students used others within their co-regulatory networks to support a range of self-regulated learning activities. Whom students engaged, and the purpose of engagement, seemed to shift as students progressed through clinical training. Over time, the proportion of students engaging workplace supervisors to discuss learning goals, learning strategies, self-reflections and self-evaluations increased, whereas the proportion of students engaging peers to discuss learning strategies and how to work on learning goals in the workplace decreased. Of all purposes for which students engaged others measured, discussing self-reflections and self-evaluations were consistently among the ones most frequently mentioned. Conclusions: Results reinforce the notion that medical students’ regulation of learning is grounded in social interactions within co-regulatory networks students construct during clerkships. Findings elucidate the extent to which students enact self-regulatory learning within their co-regulatory networks and how their co-regulatory learning behaviors develop over time. Explicating the relevance of interactions within co-regulatory networks might help students and supervisors to purposefully engage in meaningful co-regulatory interactions. Additionally, co-regulatory interactions may assist students in regulating their learning in clinical workplaces as well as in honing their self-regulated learning skills. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: As skills need to be changed in a dynamic learning environment, employability depends not just on what people already know but on how well they learn, apply and adapt breaking out their comfort zone. This study explores how students from all backgrounds and teachers can engage with inclusive education without discrimination through pedagogy. The research provides a platform through implication for other international readers of developing countries to implement pedagogies of the Indian context. Design/methodology/approach: This archival research focuses on the topical literature to scrutinize efficient ways to elevate the realization of all learners in inclusive settings. What inclusive pedagogy teaching approaches, focusing on the key competences and sustains learning which are effectual in elevating the academic success of all novices. Findings: Educators need to develop their skills and competency by breaking their comfort zone, and individual recital of every faculty affiliate is a decisive feature in accomplishing quality for inclusive education. An education institution also needs to provide passable facilities to academicians and students in order to adapt and utilize technology efficiently without any discrimination. This is an important method of assisting educators to recognize and investigate using this epistemology in new innovative inclusive teaching pedagogy with technologies in industry 4.0. Research limitations/implications: The study momentarily suggests an innovative pedagogy approach for stakeholders and users to be adapted in current digital arena. Originality/value: Review of the concepts can provide valuable pointers for policy makers in other jurisdictions contemplating inclusive education. The issues that are dealt with relate to how all students with and without disability can be engaged in a classroom without discrimination, and development is incentivized using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in teaching pedagogy. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Introduction. A contradiction which we are able to observe over a few recent decades between necessity to participate in innovative processes and their natural stressogenic character has underlined the importance of developing programs for proactive organizational socialization which will be capable of building up successful behavior competences in VUCA environment in Industry 4.0. When self-actualization in labor is being devalued, attitude to labor is now considered as a key competence. Purpose: to reveal features of attitude to labor as a basis of professional socialization of learners studying at industrial colleges in countries which are now entering the new technological reality with a different degree of success: Russia, China and Iran. Materials and Methods. The analysis draws on the data obtained with WorkBAT method developed by J. Spence and A. Robbins, and their correlation with the values of organizational cultures which are characteristic of industrial colleges. The data on organizational cultures were obtained with OCAI method developed by C. Cameron and R. Quinn. Results. Russian students do not feel the changed nature of labor, their attitude to it is substituted by a wish to strengthen clan-based and loosen hierarchical components of the organizational cultures. Iranian students have a negative attitude to labor in a real hierarchical environment and a positive attitude to it in an innovative market environment, which suggests that they would be engaged and emotionally satisfied. Chinese students, having experienced specific organizational cultures of innovative companies in real life, have a positive attitude to labor in a hierarchical environment of stability and certainty. Discussion and Conclusion. The findings contribute to the development of scientific understanding of the role of value-based work readiness in the turbulent environment of a modern enterprise and the psychological mechanisms of proactive organizational socialization, taking into account socio-cultural country specificity. © Zakharova L.

AB  - In the contemporary world, communication goes far beyond the well-known traditional written or spoken forms. For today’s digital users, these have become insufficient, as using them, they cannot express their thoughts fully. The youth that has developed its own language, has become more hermetic, but not because it rejects other generations. The reason is the inability of older generations to understand the new ways of communication. Seniors find it challenging to learn how to use new technologies and stay up to date with trends. Although young people are able to understand them, the older generation cannot keep up with the news and stays excluded. The lack of mutual understanding results in weaker bonds. Once again, it is possible to observe ICT as a contemporary key competence essential for an adequate, mutually comprehensible exchange of messages. The best way to connect two generations in this aspect is informal education, especially one focusing on intergenerational activities, which will not only reduce the exclusion of a social group such as seniors but will also let them to develop their critical thinking skills, which in the age of the Internet are crucial. Bringing up both generations in two different ‘normalities’ does not make any of them inferior but simply different. Investing in education, the desire for self-development and learning about the culture of different generations will not only open people’s minds but will also have a positive impact on the development of intergenerational solidarity and mutual understanding. © 2022, Pro Scientia Publica Foundation.

AB  - Introduction: Indirect patient care activities (IPCA) such as documentation, reviewing investigations and filling out forms require an increasing amount of physician time. While an essential part of patient care, rising rates of IPCA work correspond with increases in physician burnout and job dissatisfaction. It is not known how best to prepare residents in IPCA-heavy specialties (e.g. family medicine) for this aspect of their career. This study investigates how educators and residency programmes can optimise IPCA work during residency to best prepare residents for future practice. Methods: Using Constructivist Grounded Theory, we conducted focus groups and individual interviews with 42 clinicians (19 family medicine residents, 16 family physicians in the first 5 years of practice and 7 family physician educators). All participants were connected to one family medicine residency programme. We analysed interview data iteratively, using a staged approach to constant comparative analysis. Results: While residents, early career physicians and educators perceived the educational value of IPCAs differently, they all reported IPCAs as a necessary weight that family physicians carry throughout their career. Some residents described IPCAs as a burden, creating inequities in workload and interfering with other learning and personal opportunities. In contrast, educators conceptualised IPCAs as an opportunity to build and develop the skills required to carry the weight of IPCAs throughout their career. We make specific recommendations for helping residents recognise this educational opportunity, such as clarifying expectations, navigating equity, understanding purpose and maintaining consistency when teaching IPCAs. Conclusion: IPCAs are a key competency for many medical residents but require explicit pedagogical attention. If the educational opportunities are not made explicit, residents may miss the opportunity to develop strategies for practice management, professional boundaries, and administrative efficiencies. © 2022 Association for the Study of Medical Education and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Social farming (SF) has been developing dynamically in the Czech Republic in the last 10 years and enterprises are emerging and operating where the necessary conditions and environment are created for various people from target groups. The practice in the Czech Republic is to a large extent based on international practice and follows the basic outlines of the practice of mainly European countries. In these facilities, these persons often find employment or engage in various occupational therapy programmes in the provision of social services. Thus, in this analysis, we qualitatively focus on the identification of the basic factors why these farms come into existence and what are the main determining aspects for their functioning, which are based on the long-term experience of running a farm under the social farming concept. A guided qualitative interview method was chosen with respondents who have been operating in the country for a long time in the framework of the analysis, thus bringing in stimulating experiences that accompany them in their activities. The analysis is thus essentially a first experience in this field and raises a number of further questions that could be further deepened and refined, including in an international context.  © 2022 Tomáš Chovanec et al.

AB  - Strength of educational system depends upon the quality pf teachers. Teachers have always been considered as one of the noblest professions. (Naz, 2016). Students are generally influenced by their teachers because they spend most of their time at school (Rahaman, 2010; Rosen, 2010). To teach students according to today’s standards, teachers need to understand subject matter deeply and flexibly so that they can help students create useful cognitive maps, relate one idea to another, and address misconceptions. Teachers need to see how ideas connect across fields and to everyday life. Teachers use suitable strategies and resources to follow instructions according to the needs of the needs of individuals and groups of students. Teachers should guide pupils learning in analyzing. Teachers should provide manifold models and explanations of concepts behaviors and skills. Teachers provide creative and critical thinking, problem solving ability, curiosity. They should know how to use various technological and communication. They should believe in change and flexibility in teaching learning process (Rahaman, 2010; Rosen, 2010). © 2022, Faculty of Navigation, Gdynia Maritime University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and Study Aim Material and Methods Results Conclusions For the new reform to be applied in the best possible way, it is a priority and useful to promote the development of knowledge on the organization and methods of teaching/learning in physical education in primary school. This study aims to search for a new didactic organizational model for physical education in primary school, starting from the theoretical lines, showing the contrasts of the significant aspects and the uniqueness of heuristic learning, with a consequent theoretical and argumentative elaboration of operational proposals. For this purpose, an accurate survey of the scientific literature has been analyzed, highlighting the critical issues that characterized the various proposals and attempt to implement physical activity and sports education courses in primary school over the years, up to the recent legislative innovation. The path of the definition of physical education in primary school was marked by stages that did not always enhance the educational and training dimension of the motor and sports experience, making the school discipline assume a marginal and optional role in the face of an extracurricular practice characterized by a widespread organization and more capable of intercepting and responding to the physical exercise and sport needs of society. This complex situation has only generated confusion without solving the problem of the absence of physical and sporting activity in the 5-10 age group, as required by the World Health Organization and the European Union, by adequately and uniquely qualified teachers. It is now useful to promote the development of knowledge on the didactic organization of the primary school, on the different teaching/learning methods in physical education, to contextualize the scope of the new legal provision to the current legal framework. The study highlights the value of a new approach in teacher training that aims to ensure the acquisition of key competence, according to the Recommendation of the European Parliament. This perspective can be easily realized by using a core curriculum uniformly applied at the national level. © Gaetano Altavilla, Rosario Ceruso, Giovanni Esposito, Gaetano Raiola, Francesca D’Elia, 2022.

AB  - A mindful person is prone to be open to novelty, attentive to distinctions, sensitive to context, aware of multiple perspectives, and focused on the present. Therefore, the role of mindfulness in educational contexts is gaining ground given the great possibilities it offers in developing students’ competences in education for sustainable development (ESD). The main goal of this study is to explore how mindfulness plays a key role in the learning process in response to the need to develop students’ emotional competencies in ESD, and specifically how mindfulness has an impact on academic performance through resilience. We tested the research model with a questionnaire addressed to 497 students from three higher education institutions and one secondary school. The results of a structural equation analysis confirm the study hypotheses. We find mindfulness is positively related to resilience, which leads to better academic performance. Thus, being mindful is a key competence in ESD since it allows young people to face their education with the highest possibilities of training, experience, and personal growth. This exploratory study offers further evidence of the need to invest in mindfulness to foster resilience and academic performance and represents a first step for designing additional interventions on this line. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The level of competencies that university and college students gain during their studies predetermine their employment in the labour market and their capabilities for their further development. In today's highly competitive environment, organisations are interested in graduates who have highly developed primarily soft competencies and at the same time have growth potential. The survey focuses on the identification of transferable cross-sectional competencies and their measurement among students of the private university of economics. This article aims to identify transferable cross-sectional competencies of university students that contribute most to the graduate's success in the labour market and to summarise the approach to identify tasks for the development of the educational program of the private university of economics. Chi-square tests were applied to determine the dependencies, and the data were also evaluated by factor analysis to find hidden factors. Four factors were identified, namely, appropriate communication style, complexity and self-management, performance individualism, and socially desirable behaviour.

AB  - Today critical thinking is one of the key competencies of the modern world. The abundance and availability of various information (in particular due to the spread of electronic devices and the Internet) suggest that people, regardless of age, need to be able to effectively navigate and evaluate information, draw their own conclusions and use arguments when making decisions. Research of critical thinking in terms of the possibilities of its evaluation and development began more than 60 years ago and has a wide and heterogeneous field of theoretical approaches. In this article, we explore the theoretical possibility of measuring the complex latent construct “critical thinking in an online environment” using the Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) methodology. It allows one to build a chain of arguments that substantiate the conclusion about the level of critical thinking development in the respondent and thereby ensure the fairness of the assessment process. The measurement goes from theoretical assumptions about the nature of the construct to the search for empirical evidence — observable actions in the testing process, allowing to draw reasonable conclusions about the respondents. The result of the work is a theoretical framework for assessing critical thinking in an online environment for university students and its operationalization through the relevant observed behavior of the target audience, which allows obtaining valid data on the severity of critical thinking. This is the first step to create an instrument in Russian with a confirmed psychometric quality. The key feature of the tool is that the student does not work in a simulated environment where information sources are selected by developers, but in an open online environment, therefore, he can use any available materials to solve the task. © 2022, Voprosy Obrazovaniya / Educational Studies Moscow.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) has been highlighted as a key competence of the 21st century. The literature has pointed to the use of unplugged activities, including board games (BG), as a strategy to promote the development of Computational Thinking. Recently, new modern board games (MBG), referred to as Eurogames, have aroused the interest of researchers who have underlined their unique design and mechanics. To investigate the impact of the use of MBG on CT development, a systematic literature review (SLR) was structured using the PRISMA protocol as a reference. The focus was centred on the analysis of empirical studies based on the use of board games in school settings to promote CT skills. This paper opens with the presentation of several essential concepts, among which CT and Eurogames are included, followed by the results of the SLR, focusing on the analysed articles, the theoretical frameworks supporting the studies, the research contexts and methods, the data collection instruments and the results reported by the authors. Out of 85 articles, 11 studies published between 2011 and 2021 were analysed. The results suggest that game mechanics, typical of Eurogames, reveal the potential to promote CT. However, the use of these resources requires further exploration. © 2022 Fundacion para la Investigacion Social Avanzada. All rights reserved.

AB  - Entrepreneurship and digital skills are key competences that students must acquire throughout their formal education. The EmDigital model was developed to assess digital entrepreneurship competence following a comparative analysis of these two competences. This model describes the competence of digital entrepreneurship in terms of four areas and 15 sub competences. The aim of the present study was to validate a quantitative instrument to measure digital entrepreneurship competence in university students. The following techniques were used: focus group, expert panel, cognitive interview and exploratory factor analysis. A pilot sample of 190 final year undergraduate students (60% were female with an average age of 24.97) was used. The instrument produced very good reliability indices. EFA outcomes indicated a 4-factor instrument that explained 43% of total variance. Based on the presented outcomes, the instrument was revised and a definitive questionnaire created. The final version of the questionnaire is presented in the present article. Data only revealed gender differences in relation to one of the dimensions of the instrument, namely, the identification of opportunities, in which men scored more highly. © 2022.

AB  - Teachers´ life-long learning and occupational well-being is significant in promoting educational goals and professional development. The aim of the study was to determine which factors contribute to teacher educators´ commitment to work and give them energy for work and self-development. The research data consisted of 24 teacher educators in Oulu University of Applied Sciences. The research method of this case study was a qualitative, thematic content analysis, the research approach phenomenography. The most important single factor seemed to be the community of teachers, students and the administrative staff which are included in dialogue and collaboration. Emotions, meaningfulness, and interaction play an important role, often via pedagogical fellowship. Committed teacher educators take responsibility for workplace culture and transformation of teaching. Positive attitudes, motivation, reflection, and dialogue seem to be connected to professional capability and the ethos of teacher educators´ work. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Sustainable tourism development and digital transformations are among the key issues that should be taken into account when preparing contemporary tourism degree programmes. In order to offer an innovative curriculum, systems thinking and knowledge from the intersection of many areas including tourism, geography, information and communication technology, management, teaching methodology and psychology are required. The adaptation of curricula should also take into account the experience of universities outside Poland which have often successfully implemented programmes covering sustainable development issues for many years and have feedback on the satisfaction of both graduates and employers. This article presents the results of the work of an international consortium of universities from Germany, Poland, Serbia and Switzerland which developed a course programme on ‘ICT as a tool for the development and promotion of sustainable tourism’ that can be adapted by a wide range of organisations such as universities, NGOs and tourism training companies. © by the author, licensee University of Lodz – Lodz University Press, Lodz, Poland.

AB  - The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) sets standards known as Milestones and monitors the progress of medical residents as they advance toward medical practice in their specialties. Health sciences librarians need to train medical residents in certain competency areas to help reach the Milestone standards. This project analyzed the Milestones related to informatics, library, and evidence-based practice (EBP) skills to identify core and optional library-related curricular elements that can be integrated into different medical specialty residencies. The authors collected key competency documents from ACGME and from those specialties representing 2% or more of the residencies in the United States. Then, they compared and contrasted those Milestones related to informatics, library, and EBP competency skills. Most relevant Milestones were categorized under the fifth broad ACGME competency area of “Practice Based Learning and Improvement.” The Milestones followed developmental patterns, reflecting residents’ increased sophistication in meeting these competencies as they advanced in their specialties. The curriculum was designed to meet the residents’ learning needs at each progressive Milestone. © 2022 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The pedagogy underpinning clinical psychology training is often reliant upon the acquisition and transmission of knowledge and the practice of skills. The dominant paradigm in the training of clinical psychologists emphasises competence-based training drawing upon a scientist practitioner model of practice, often underpinned by knowledge of evidence-based interventions. Little has changed over the past 40 years. Training is predicated upon the assumption that effective therapy is attributed to the therapist’s skills to implement specific therapeutic processes and her or his capacity to form an effective working alliance with the client or patient. We provide an argument for an alternative paradigm in which ecological principles are privileged with a view to enhancing clinical training of psychologists in health settings responsive to the trainee as well as the broader societal context in which they practice, by adopting a pedagogy which prioritizes the relationship between the person and the environment. The proposed approach brings an ecological set of assumptions to the learning experience in clinical contexts. Key principles, drawn from an ecological perspective includes: affordances, the emergence of self-organisation in clinical learning, constraints and rate limiters. The approach is supported by examples applied to clinical learning contexts. Implications for clinical training are discussed. The ways in which an ecological approach may contribute to more effective learning outcomes through the use of representative learning contexts may inform learning design, how learning is actioned in clinical psychology as well as future research on the pedagogy of clinical training. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between the variables of activity preferences in physical education lessons and their power of prediction on the development of basic competences. Based on the contextual isomorphism of teaching and learning situations in physical education, a scale of practice preferences was designed and validated and grouped into families, according to their construct and consequential validity. To do so, we designed and validated a scale of activity preferences in physical education lessons. Two studies were carried out with students between the ages of 12 and 18. The first study was on a sample of 219 participants, where an activity preferences scale was designed and validated. The second study was carried out on a sample of 476 students, and measured activity preferences and the perception of basic competences. The results showed that the activity preferences scale was valid and reliable. When class activities coincided with the students’ preferences it positively predicted basic competences. © 2022 Barrachina-Peris & Moreno-Murcia, licensee EURJHM.

AB  - Background: Acquiring medical knowledge is a key competency for medical students and a lifelong requirement for physicians. Learning techniques can improve academic success and help students cope with stressors. To support students’ learning process medical faculties should know about learning techniques. The purpose of this study is to analyse the preferred learning techniques of female and male as well as junior and senior medical students and how these learning techniques are related to perceived learning difficulties. Methods: In 2019, we conducted an online survey with students of the undergraduate, competency-based curriculum of medicine at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. We chose ten learning techniques of high, moderate and low utility according to Dunlosky et al. (2013) and we asked medical students to rate their preferred usage of those techniques using a 5-point Likert scale. We applied t-tests to show differences in usage between female and male as well as junior and senior learners. Additionally, we conducted a multiple regression analysis to explore the predictive power of learning techniques regarding perceived difficulties. Results: A total of 730 medical students (488 women, 242 men, Mage = 24.85, SD = 4.49) use three techniques the most: ‘highlighting’ (low utility), ‘self-explanation’ (moderate utility) and ‘practice testing’ (high utility). Female students showed a significantly higher usage of low-utility learning techniques (t(404.24) = -7.13, p <.001) and a higher usage of high-utility learning techniques (t(728) = -2.50, p <.05) than male students (M = 3.55, SD =.95). Compared to junior students (second to sixth semester; M = 3.65, SD =.71), senior students (seventh semester to final clerkship year; M = 3.52, SD =.73) showed a lower use of low-utility learning techniques (t(603) = 2.15, p <.05). Usage of low-utility techniques is related to more difficulties (β =.08, t(724) = 2.13, p <.05). Usage of moderate-utility techniques is related to less learning difficulties (β = -.13, t(599) = -3.21, p <.01). Conclusions: Students use a wide range of low-, moderate- and high-utility learning techniques. The use of learning techniques has an influence on the difficulties perceived by students. Therefore, they could benefit from knowing about and using high-utility learning techniques to facilitate their learning. Faculties should inform their students about effective learning and introduce them to useful learning techniques. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - In the present study, we aimed to specify the key competence domains perceived to be critical for the teaching profession and depict them as a comprehensive teacher competence model. An expert panel that included representatives from seven units providing university-based initial teacher education in Finland carried out this process. To produce an active construction of a shared understanding and an interpretation of the discourse in the field, the experts reviewed literature on teaching. The resulting teacher competence model, the multidimensional adapted process model of teaching (MAP), represents a collective conception of the relevant empirical literature and prevailing discourses on teaching. The MAP is based on Blömeke et al.’s, Zeitschrift für Psychologie, 223, 3–13, (2015) model which distinguishes among teacher competences (referring to effective performance of teachers’ work), competencies (knowledge, skills, and other individual competencies underlying and enabling effective teaching), and situation-specific skills of perceiving, interpreting, and making decisions in situations involving teaching and learning. The implications of the MAP for teacher education and student selection for initial teacher education are discussed. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Theoretical basis: This case uses two key theoretical notions for discussion and analysis: Policy-trade off model by Deborah Stone is adapted to the context of decision-making during the cyclone warning [Stone, Deborah. Policy Paradox: The Art of Political Decision-Making. Third, New York: W.W. Norton & Co, 2012.]. The critical success factors in disaster response- John R. Harrald’s five-stage framework is applied to analyse Case B. [Harrald, John R. “Agility and Discipline: Critical Success Factors for Disaster Response:” The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 8 September 2016. https://doi.org/10.1177/0002716205285404.]. Research methodology: This case is written with the information collected through interviews, over three months from March 2020, with Ms Ranjana Chopra (Indian Administrative Services), a senior civil servant working for the Government of Odisha, who was associated with the event in the case. Secondary sources, including newspaper reports and meteorological bulletins from the Indian Meteorological Department, is also made use of. Case overview/synopsis: Anupama Gowda was the District Magistrate of Kalinga in the state of Odisha, in the Eastern coast of the Indian peninsula. In April 2019, when the meteorological department issued a cyclone warning, she had to take a call on how to go ahead. Her team did not seem too enthused as Kalinga was away from the coast and meteorological warnings were taken as routine. The case discusses Gowda’s dilemma on whether to push for full-fledged preparations or a limited preparation at least or leave it laissez-faire. She made the decision by 24th April and “what happened” serve as Case B. Complexity academic level: This case is intended to cover two key competencies: decision-making in ambiguity for public service professionals or bureaucrats and disaster response within a limited time period and resources. This case is useful for undergraduate-level foundational courses with decision-making under ambiguity as a component; in management, public policy and public administration disciplines. Executive training or short-term courses for early-career public service professionals (with no solid background in management/policy theory) on decision-making at the local administration level. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Digital competence has gained a strong prominence in the educational context, being one of the key competencies that teachers must master in today's society. Although most models and frameworks focus on the pre-university level, there is a growing interest in knowing the state of digital competencies of university teachers, that is, the set of knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for a teacher to make effective use of technologies. The aim of this research is to present a systematic review of the literature in the Web of Science and Scopus, to identify, analyze and classify the published articles between 2000 and 2021 on digital competences, and thus find and improve the research being done on digital skills and future avenues of teachers in the university context. The SciMAT software is used in the analysis. The initial search reveals more than 343 articles in English, of which 152 are duplicates and 135 are not related to the topic of study. After this filtering, 56 articles are obtained and analyzed in depth. The results reveal a predominance of research that focuses on analyzing teachers' self-assessment and reflection of their digital competencies. Teachers recognize that they have a low or medium–low digital competence, as well as the absence of certain competencies, especially those related to the evaluation of educational practice. Despite the multiple studies that address this issue, it is necessary to continue improving research in this area, deepening the assessment of teachers' digital competencies and design, on this basis, more practical and personalized training programs that respond to the needs of teachers in the digital era. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Abstract Understanding the main causes of biodiversity decline is an essential part of the syllabus of any university-level course in conservation biology. A novel computer-based activity is described for introducing students to using the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List database. The specific objectives of this activity are (1) to understand the main causes that threaten species worldwide and, if these causes differ, to try to elucidate the underlying processes that might be responsible for these differences in a given country and (2) to train students how to use digital biological data platforms, such as the IUCN Red List, and how to analyze and interpret biological data. To achieve these goals, students must obtain information from the IUCN Red List to assess why species are threatened globally and in a given country. Based on the total number of threatened species, students calculate the percentage of species affected by each threat within each Red List category and for all categories combined both globally and at the national level. The activity ends with a discussion in the classroom where the students are expected to share their interpretations about the main causes that threaten biodiversity at different scales of analysis and the applications of their findings in a conservation context. The activity is expected to increase the awareness of students regarding environmental issues and to develop different key competencies and basic skills as learning outcomes, including expertise in biological diagnosis, information management, and using the internet as an information source.  ©

AB  - The proliferation of digital technologies sometimes referred to as the 'industrial or technological (digital) revolution’ primarily affects the education sphere. The introduction of online learning technologies and the focus on independent and critical thinking actualizes the problem of developing these skills in future teachers and lawyers with the help of digital tools. The study looked at the critical thinking development in education while focusing on the use of digital tools in rational thinking formation in education. The research involved a random sample of undergraduate pedagogy students from [BLINDED] Institute of [BLINDED] University and graduate law students from [BLINDED] Institute. The digital tools were used to develop test tasks and logic problems, present information in graphical form, brainstorm, and collaborate in real-time to solve the created problems. The level of critical thinking development was assessed in dynamics using the method designed by Mishina based on the research Diane Halpern, Igor Zageshev, and Sergei Zair-Beck. The outcomes confirm the original hypothesis about the positive impact of digital tools on the formation of critical thinking in students. © 2022

AB  - Global competence as a learning objective has become relevant since its inclusion in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Despite the growing interest in this competence, there are several issues requiring deep reflection, such as: What is global competence? How has it been constructed? From which approaches are the discursive processes for its construction based? And, what does intercultural education contribute to this construct? To answer these questions, this paper analyses the background, conceptualisations, approaches and theories on which the concept has been built, with special emphasis on interculturality as an educational approach and model that favours inclusion. The method used is a critical review and discursive analysis. It has been found that the instrumentalist approach to social efficiency has predominated in the conceptualisation, (at least as the underlying approach), as opposed to an approach of social re-constructionism that usually appears in the foreground. On many occasions the global competence and intercultural competence constructs are used interchangeably, although the former is more comprehensive in addressing the challenges of globalisation. Finally, it is highlighted that there are conceptual and measurement challenges and limitations that make it difficult to compare the acquisition of this competence at an international level and that therefore require more studies that systematically investigate the construction of the concept, its development and measurement. © 2022 Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca.

AB  - Technology has been integrated into the different curricular areas since the digital competence is considered a key competence and its consequent impact on educational policy in different countries. This phenomenon has also affected Music education, for which technology has great potential. This study focuses on the relationship between technology and Music Education from a bibliometric and bibliographic approach. On one hand, research was carried out on scientific production in quantitative terms, based on the analysis of the 161 selected articles from the Web of Science and Scopus databases and, on the other hand, the content of the 55 publications available in open access. Results confirm the increase in relevant scientific production over the past 5 years and the predominant positions of the United States and Spain. It also highlights the pre-eminence of research focused on higher education, students and teachers being the main participants. The variety of technology implemented in training processes is also noteworthy, as well as its positive impact not only on aspects related to the discipline itself, but also on the development of transversal competencies. © 2022 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

AB  - Citizen science is expected to play an important role in relation to scientific literacy Vision III for students living in the future society. This study aims to identify the characteristics of extreme citizen science (ECS) and extreme citizen scientists (ECS s) and to derive key competencies of ECS s using literature analysis from Korean and international educational contexts. The characteristics of ECS are identified were as follows: Citizens recognize problems, set research topics, establish data collection plans to solve them, analyze and interpret collected data, and conduct social action. Three categories of key competencies for ECS s were derived: Thinking scientifically with appropriate knowledge, exploring as knowledge producers, and acting while considering both individuals and communities. The results of this study can be used for developing citizen science competency measurement tools, development of ECS programs, and training of ECS s. Implications for future research are considered. © 2022 by Kwon et al.

AB  - Teacher training programs and models recognize research engagement as a key competency of qualified professionals. However, despite current calls from scholars to bridge the divide between research and practice in second language teaching, little is known about how teaching professionals engage with existing research or carry out their own research. This study is the first to address this issue with regards to Spanish Language Teaching (SLT) professionals, aiming to understand if and how they engage with and in research, and identify what they would need to increase their engagement. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of online survey responses from 1,675 SLT professionals from 84 countries show that research engagement is dependent on the job description. Coding of free-text responses into eight themes (motivation, prestige, support, training, professionalization, resources, community, and research areas) reveals that the main barrier to greater research engagement is lack of support. Our results contribute to the understanding of the concepts of research engagement and research culture within the context of SLT and inform future initiatives to strengthen the research-practice nexus.  © 2022 The Author(s) (2022).

AB  - Although the ability to deal with stress is one of the key competences of people working in managerial positions in schools and educational establishments, principals in this area are very poorly diagnosed. The aim of this study was to consider the coping strategies used by headmasters and deputy headmasters of schools and educational establishments during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, Mini-COPE was used. The respondents (N = 159) obtained a higher mean for “active coping”, “planning”, “positive reframing”, “acceptance”, “use of instrumental support”, “venting”, and “problem-focused strategies” than the normative value. Compared to deputy headmasters, headmasters obtained higher mean results for “planning” and “religion”, and lower results for “behavioral disengagement”. Respondents with longer job seniority in a managerial position, obtained a higher mean for “use of instrumental support” and lower for “religion”. Compared to respondents employed in private schools, people in the public education sector are more likely to use “behavioral disengagement” and less their “sense of humor”. The respondents working in primary schools scored higher on average for “use of instrumental support” and “problem-focused strategies”. It would be advisable to compare the results with the teachers and the persons holding managerial positions in institutions and organizations not related to education. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Geographical practice power is a key competency essential for students’ overall development. It is, therefore, important to understand its concepts, contexts, and content. Practical activities following scientific and operable principles in real geographical situations would enable students to unleash their potential across the curriculum. The primary aim of this study was to design and validate a conceptual, contextual, and content framework for geographical practice power competency (GPPC) of primary and secondary school students in China. The study used a three-step mixed-method research design with expert opinions collected through interviews and questionnaires. The dimensions of GPPC in this study included the mental processes of cognition, awareness, attitude, and behavior. A compilation of the attributes of GPPC for primary and secondary school students was proposed. There was a general consensus among the evaluators regarding the conceptual, contextual, and content framework of GPPC. When the weight values of the four dimensions and sub-dimensions of GPPC were calculated, it was found that they played different roles in the framework. Contrary to the expectation that scientific argumentation would be the most important dimension of GPPC, this study found that information acquisition was rated the most important. In each GPPC sub-dimension, consciousness received the highest weighting. © 2022, Scientia Socialis Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In 2018, among 10 key competencies that the Vietnam Ministry of Education and Training has proposed in the new education curriculum, numeracy was identified as an essential competency that needs to be developed for students in the future. However, little is known about the numeracy of students in general, and of students in mountainous areas in particular. The aim of this study was to design an assessment of numeracy for students in the mountainous areas to understand their performance in numeracy. The study used the quantitative approach. A sample of 730 students in grades 6-8 from eight provinces in the mountainous areas of Northern Vietnam was recruited to participate in the study. A numeracy framework and three tests with anchor items were designed and developed to measure students' numeracy. The results of the analysis using an approach to item response theory showed that the items had good fits with the model, and they could be used to describe numeracy learning progression with different levels of proficiency. The tests were reliable and valid, and the anchor items were good for connecting students' competency among grades. The results also showed that Vietnamese students in mountainous areas tended to perform better in Arithmetic and Algebra problems than in reallife problems. The results provide convincing evidence of the practical performance in numeracy of students in various ethnic minority groups in Northern Vietnam.  ©Authors.

AB  - Previous studies agree on the benefits of improving the relevant competences in students by applying globalized learning methodologies and projects in the STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). However, few studies have focused on whether including other subjects in Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (HASS) in these projects improves high school students’ perceptions on improvement in these skills. The objective of this work was to study the effect of participation in interdisciplinary teaching projects (STEM and HASS), which promote globalized and project-based learning, on the perception of self-efficacy of secondary school students in basic competences for learning. It also analyzes the modulating role of gender on said perception. High school students from Galicia participated in this study. Both before and after participating in teaching projects according to the MODEL of the ATS-STEM project, they completed a questionnaire on self-efficacy in the eight key competences for STEM learning defined in the model: disciplinary STEM competences, problem solving, innovation and creativity, communication, critical thinking, metacognitive skills, collaboration and self-regulation. The results showed an improvement in all the competences evaluated (although only the men showed an increase in collaboration). Nevertheless, there was a lower perception of competence in women than in men in discipline competences, problem solving and metacognitive skills. Therefore, the benefits of interdisciplinary ATSSTEM learning experiences on the self-efficacy perceived by high school students were confirmed, although the results continue to show a gender gap. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Self-assessment is to engage students as active participants in their learning and to reflect the results of their efforts since the key idea of self-assessment is that a child should achieve the learning goal and realize his achievements. The purpose of the study is to reveal the factors causing the lack of self-assessment in primary school lessons. The research collected data using observations and a questionnaire. The participants included 60 primary school teachers from the school of Almaty, the Republic of Kazakhstan. The collected data were analyzed using percentages. Based on the results of the research, the lack of the self-assessment component in the educational process is caused by the lack of assessment tools, which explains the negative attitude of teachers toward self-assessment. The efficiency of the implementation of the innovation in inclusive education needs to ensure the proper training of teachers, including key competencies for working in inclusive classes, and strengthening of its practical component. © 2022 SciencePark Science, Organization and Counseling.

AB  - The acquisition of entrepreneurial competence during compulsory education is not only the goal but also the pedagogical expectation and the expected outcome of modern education. Such an acquisition in its complexity of formulation, definitions as well as skills and abilities is a challenge for educational stakeholders. At the same time, the search for effective solutions, approaches and models for implementation in the educational process remains open and needs to be analysed and evaluated. This paper aims to analyse the benefits of learning through gaining experience with the aim of mastering entrepreneurship as one of the key competencies required for self-Actualisation, lifelong development and achieving global competitiveness in the labour market. It describes, analyses and identifies elements of experiential learning as a prerequisite for the acquisition of entrepreneurial competence. The paper presents the results of research conducted on a specific educational model for entrepreneurship: The Centre for Entrepreneurial Excellence of Varaždin County (Croatia). From the analysis and interpretation of the obtained results, the findings show that the concepts of experiential learning and teaching at the Centre have been implemented through didactic-methodical work with students. Thus, these concepts are an effective approach for the development of entrepreneurship among students. © 2022 Association of Slovenian Educationalists. All rights reserved.

AB  - Interpersonal skill development is a key part of training in clinical psychology. High-quality training involves two key practices: true-to-life experiential exercises and real-time feedback. Unfortunately, these two practices are in conflict. Ethical and practical constraints limit the use of real clients, leaving most training programs to rely on role-plays with other students and faculty. Role-play exercises, while valuable, often lack the emotion, unpredictability, and salience of work with actual clients. This can be addressed by the use of simulated patients—actors carefully trained to realistically portray patients in certain training situations. This article describes one such training model used with first-year doctoral students in clinical psychology. In addition, two potential options for evaluating the efficacy of the program are described. The utility of the program is then discussed in the context of key competencies, accreditation, and the larger context of dissemination and implementation (D & I) of evidence-based practice. © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - Collaborative problem solving, as a key competency in the 21st century, includes both social and cognitive processes with interactive, interdependent, and periodic characteristics, so it is difficult to analyze collaborative problem solving by traditional coding and counting methods. There is a need for a new analysis approach that can capture the temporal and dynamic process of collaborative problem solving in diversity online collaborative learning context to provide some insights into online collaborative learning design. During an eight-week semester, a total of 42 student teachers participated in two online collaborative learning activities. Student teachers' discourse data were collected, and the data were coded based on a collaborative problem solving assessment model. This study used Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) to explore the collaborative problem solving processes of student teachers in different online collaborative learning tasks. The results showed that both the high and low academic performance groups worked to maintain positive communication, but the students in the high academic performance groups negotiated on ideas while the students in the low academic performance groups focused on sharing resources/ideas. Moreover, fine-grained centroid analysis on a weekly basis showed that the high academic performance groups began by maintaining positive communication, and ended by negotiating ideas, while the low academic performance groups began by sharing resources/ideas and ended by regulating problem solving activities. Finally, the implications, limitations, and future research were discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent global challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the growing importance of children learning 21st-century skills for adaptation and flexibility. Competence-based curricula encourage creativity and problem solving but little is known about their development in low-income countries or relationship with conventional academic outcomes like literacy. This study examines pupils’ cognitive flexibility, the underlying basis for many 21st-century skills, in Rwandan primary schools and finds little association with their reading abilities. The findings advance international knowledge regarding child development in resource-poor contexts, suggest a need for more holistic measurement and offer a new approach for understanding learners’ adaptability. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - In the digital age, English literacy is one of the key competences for high school students. This study aimed to explore the relationship between English literacy and academic achievement. To this end, the four-dimensional English literacy scale by the General High School English Curriculum Standard (2017 Edition, 2020 Revised Edition) set was used, and 446 high school students participated in the survey in March 2022. The results indicate no significant difference in English literacy between male and female students. Moreover, the structural equation model results showed that (1) Language ability significantly predicted cultural consciousness, thinking quality, and learning ability; (2) Thinking quality and learning ability correlated with students' academic achievement; (3) Nevertheless, cultural consciousness did not predict academic achievement; and (4) Learning ability mediated between language ability and academic achievement. This conclusion highlights that cultivating students' learning ability and language ability can improve their academic achievement. Therefore, teachers should exert more effort to develop students' language ability and learning ability in the future.  © Authors.

AB  - Objective. The entry-to-practice PharmD degree is designed to meet the Educational Outcomes of the Association of Faculties of Pharmacy of Canada (AFPC). We set out to evaluate how assessment strate-gies in a “capstone” course align with AFPC educational outcomes, their respective key and enabling competencies, and whether enough assessments exist for students to demonstrate achievement of competencies prior to embarking on advanced pharmacy practice experiences. Methods. We mapped each assessment’s objectives, content, and methods to the key and enabling competencies of each role of a pharmacist. The number of enabling competencies mapped represents the extent to which the assessment addressed the associated key competency and broader role. Deidentified student performance data were analyzed to identify achievement of competencies despite failed assessments. Results. Of the seven role descriptions, the roles care provider, communicator, and collaborator were the most comprehensively assessed. The roles leader-manager and health advocate were assessed to a limited extent. The role scholar was not covered to a great depth across assessments. The role professional was not represented in most assessments except for the final examination. Students with failed assessments generally had ample opportunity to demonstrate competencies through other assessments. Conclusion. Mapping assessments to AFPC educational outcomes is an essential step to demonstrate direct evidence that students have achieved the intended learning outcomes. Our map revealed that the assessments sufficiently overlapped with most AFPC educational outcomes with a few exceptions. It is important to create multiple opportunities within a course for students to demonstrate achievement of competencies to ensure practice readiness. © 2022, American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.

AB  - Background: Despite increased recognition that physician-patient communication represents a key competency for medical trainees, relatively little is known about student exposures to conversations about serious illness. Objective: To characterize student experiences with multiple types of serious illness conversations during their medicine acting internship (AI). Design: This is a cross-sectional survey. Setting/Subjects: Final-year medical students who had completed a medicine AI within one year at one U.S. medical school. Measurements: Exposures to and perceptions of multiple conversation domains (discussions with upset patients/families, breaking bad news, assessing code status, and conversations about limiting or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments). Results: We collected 82 survey responses (78% response rate). Students reported multiple exposures across most domains, some of which included leading conversations without supervision or formal instruction. In most domains, at least 50% of students reported confidence in their ability to lead unsupervised conversations moving forward. Conclusions: After a four-week AI, students reported multiple exposures to a variety of serious illness conversations. Some reported having these conversations without supervision. Student confidence in their ability to lead these conversations independently was higher than has been previously reported in other small studies. Further exploration is required to better understand these trends, and targeted curricular development may be indicated.  © David Staudt et al., 2022; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2022.

AB  - With an increasing pace of digitalization, automatization, and robotization, firms need to quickly anticipate new consumer values, trends, and needs and adjust their production, thus requiring constant adaptation of competences and competence-based models. This review: (1) briefly outlines the development of competence-based models; (2) presents difficulties when defining and delineating differences between competences, skills, and abilities; (3) presents the main challenges of competence measurement; (4) presents recent findings of competence-based models in organizational and individual context; and (5) highlights challenges these models are likely to encounter in the future. To this end, a non-systematic literature review was carried out to summarize relevant published research studies and to define future research directions. Results show that further competence-based research should focus on generalizing the findings by looking at various groups of workers and industries, expanding the set of competences used in the analyses, using different definitions of key competences, and developing alternative models to assess their impact on performance. Such research would allow to better assess employees’ preparedness in terms of competence requirements, as well as to identify the most critical gaps and opportunities for the formal educational system and as part of on-the-job training. © 2022, The Author(s).

Research limitations/implications: The main findings document the important step forward in promoting civics competencies in Romanian primary education, and social competencies in the lower secondary curriculum. Various challenges affecting the effective implementation of these changes are identified, both at system and school-level. Practical implications: Focus on formal written and taught curriculum. As curriculum reform in upper secondary education is ongoing, the analysis is limited to primary and lower secondary education. © 2022, sowi-online e.V.. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article explores the critical role of education in promoting sustainable development in the Maldives context. It presents the outcomes of a small-scale project, Playing with Solar, implemented in a small island school in collaboration with the island community. Because of the environmental and educational principles embedded in this project, it is presented as one that prioritizes sustainable development, actively engages with the community, and aligns with the key competencies underpinning the Maldives National Curriculum Framework. The Playing with Solar project is an example of transformative pedagogy aligned with sustainable development. By promoting problem-based learning, the project shows how key competencies and pedagogical principles can be operationalized in line with National Curriculum Framework syllabi that promote interdisciplinary learning, in contrast to textbook-based, transmission models of teaching. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - fessionals in Finland, Latvia, Estonia, and Aland Islands. In total, 221 responses were obtained. The qualitative and quantitative data analysis was performed using NVivo and SPSS. Results. Qualitative data analysis revealed that the conceptual knowledge of business graduates was the most frequently mentioned category, followed by pro-cedural knowledge. Among the key competencies in sustainability, the most neces-sary was intra-personal competence, followed by inter-personal competence. Quantitative data analysis revealed that the top three sustainable finance competencies in demand within respondents’ organisations were: to understand relevant driving sustainable forces, to think and operate with a long-term perspective, and to com-municate sustainable financial information in a meaningful way. Conclusion. In the Baltic Region’s finance sector, there is a need for a more holi-stic view for understanding the market as part of society as a whole and also the meaning of understanding long-term horizons. The competencies that financial services sector professionals found important for vocational business graduates in future work were used as an input for elaborating vocational business education study courses. © 2021, Pro Scientia Publica Foundation.

AB  - Consultation is a key competency area for school psychologists, though much is unknown about how school psychologists develop the competency to consult. Deliberate practice (DP) is a promising approach to enhance use of communication skills, thereby supporting consultation competence. DP training included multiple opportunities for video-recorded consultation practice in response to a consultee’s request for assistance, self-reflection on skill application, and corrective supervisory feedback. In this randomized controlled trial, 109 school psychology graduate students across 45 training programs received either consultation training as usual delivered through their first consultation course (control group; n = 61) or a supplemental DP training intervention in addition to their first consultation course (treatment group; n = 48). Students who completed the DP training significantly increased their use of communication skills during a simulated practice opportunity, while the control group participants did not. Students in the DP condition also reported significantly greater self-efficacy than students in the control group, although students in both groups reported significantly greater self-efficacy over time. DP participants also reported high levels of training satisfaction. Implications of these findings for the design and delivery of consultation training and supervision are discussed. © 2022.

AB  - Studies of connections between teacher behaviour and student outcomes are numerous, but those specifically addressing such connections in a competence-based vocational education setting are limited. For a sample of Indonesian students, this study examined the connection between two dimensions of teacher interpersonal behaviour (proximity and influence) and student competency levels, as well as whether or not these relations are mediated by students’ intrinsic motivation. Additionally, it examined if these relations differed in learning environments with high versus low characteristics of competence-based education (HCBE vs. LCBE). Three questionnaires responded to by 506 first-year students were analysed using multigroups structural equation modelling. Teacher cooperative behaviour affected student motivation positively, and the influence was stronger in LCBE learning environments. Teacher controlling behaviour reduced student-perceived competency levels, with the reduction stronger in HCBE learning environments. Implications of the findings for teaching and learning in vocational education are discussed. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Positive education, as a method for the positive development of students’ personality, embodies the 24 character strengths that Peterson and Seligman developed in their studies and that are necessary for new professional profiles. This new social and work landscape inspired supranational institutions, such as the European Union, to develop theories for new educational systems. These Key Competencies seek the comprehensive training of students, on not only the cognitive but the socioemotional plane, as occurs with arts education. With this literature review, we intend to demonstrate the relationship between the Key Competencies as catalysts for the development of character strengths in students through art education programmes. The results conclude that it is possible to define a relationship between the Key Competencies and character strengths and to outline the nature of these relationships, noting that certain patterns of combinations of strengths are repeated in the Key Competencies. Additionally, our work leads us to propose the need to increase the volume of research in this field and to design future studies that allow an empirical evaluation of the nature of these connections and whether they are efficient and enduring. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Education for sustainable development is a method of teaching aimed at developing awareness, competence, knowledge, skills, and attitudes in the field of environmental protection in such a way that each activity related to its operation supports the satisfaction of the needs of future generations. In the face of environmental and social challenges, these are key competencies that require significant changes in university curricula, supporting a sustainable and innovative economy. This article aims to present the results of a study on young people’s awareness of sustainable development and their opinion on the implementation of SDGs in curricula. The publication responds to the demand of technical students for educational content related to sustainable development and a greater integration of economic, social, and environmental issues. The analysis carried out as part of the EnAct-SDGs project at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow (Poland) shows that students are increasingly aware of the importance of sustainable development in various aspects of their lives, both in their education, in their professional work and in their lives, as part of an awareness-raising society. The conducted analyses allowed us to define the directions of necessary changes in the didactic process as an essential set of skills and knowledge for future graduates of raw materials faculties. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Reading is a key competence for knowledge acquisition and learning processes. One important source of reading motivation is interest. Even though students' text-based interest often differs by gender, it remains unclear which text factors underlie these differences and whether text-based interest relates to reading comprehension among boys and girls. In a sample of 514 elementary students (47.2% girls), this study examined whether text topic, protagonists' gender, and text difficulty affect boys' and girls' text-based interest and whether interest and reading comprehension are intertwined. Based on a repeated within-subject design using fourteen narrative texts, the results indicated that boys' interest was higher in texts with male-attributed topics, male protagonists, and in more difficult texts. In contrast, girls’ interest was only affected by text difficulty. Text-based interest and reading comprehension were significantly related, albeit stronger for boys than for girls. The findings are discussed regarding future implications for research and educational practice. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, we develop and apply the concept of ‘insight discovery’ as a key competence for transdisciplinary research and learning. To address complex societal and environmental problems facing the world today, a particular expertise that can identify new connections between diverse knowledge fields is needed in order to integrate diverse perspectives from a wide range of stakeholders and develop novel solutions. The capacity for “insight discovery” means becoming aware of personal mental representations of the world and being able to shape and integrate perspectives different from one’s own. Based on experiences and empirical observations within the scope of an educational programme for Masters students, PhD candidates and post-doctoral researchers, we suggest that insights are the outcome of a learning process influenced by the collective and environment in which they are conceived, rather than instant moments of individual brilliance. The process which we describe, named the insight discovery process (IDP), is made up of five aspects. Within a group setting, a person begins with an “original mental model”, experiences an “insight trigger”, processes new information within the “liminal space”, “formulates an insight” and eventually forms an “adapted mental model”. There is a potential for incorporating such process as a fundamental competence for transdisciplinary curricula in undergraduate and graduate programmes by cultivating specific practices and safe learning environments, focused on the enquiry, exchange and integration of diverse perspectives. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The Information and Knowledge Society demands the development of skills for the critical and responsible consumption and use of technology for leisure, personal, professional, academic development, and citizen participation. The international frameworks of “21st Century Competences” underline the importance of digital competence as the axis to enhance the rest of competences. This key competence goes beyond the operational use of technological tools and applications and has been studied from different approaches. This research explores digital literacy in eight international frameworks from different institutions and initiatives: UNESCO, European Union, OECD, ATCS, P21, NETS, NAEP, and Engauge, from which a content analysis is performed, and where the areas of scope of the competencies and the relationships between the different proposals are explored. The findings contribute to the understanding of an integrated approach to digital literacy, where six dimensions are identified: critical, cognitive, operational, social, emotional, and projective. Three dimensional profiles are also identified that point towards the critical use of technology, the appropriation of technology in daily life and social innovation, which invites a rethink towards digital literacy from a multi and interdimensional vision. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: Higher education institutions (HEIs) have a great responsibility to put education for sustainable development at the centre of their work. Curricula should therefore start to incorporate the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and key competencies in sustainability, and research should be carried out to determine effective learning methods for this. This study aims to explore the usefulness of problem-based learning (PBL) approaches to train biomedical students in sustainability and to provide some recommendations for the design and implementation of new PBL-SDG scenarios. Design/methodology/approach: Two PBL-SDG scenarios were designed, implemented and evaluated for 110 students of human biology degree. Learning outcomes and student perceptions of this approach were analysed through questionnaires, student productions, non-participant observation and focus groups. Findings: The results show that the PBL-SDG scenarios effectively addressed several SDGs and sustainability competencies in a transversal, collaborative and innovative manner. According to student perceptions, the elements that contributed most to the development of these competencies were emotional involvement with the scenario, reflection on their own actions, freedom to approach the problem and tutors who empowered them with their proposals. Originality/value: The PBL-SDG approach presented in this study is an example of a pedagogical strategy that can help HEIs educate their learners as key change agents. The findings of this study provide evidence for this important aspect and give guidelines and strategies to successfully designing and implementing such methodologies in biomedical education. © 2022, Mar Carrió Llach and Maria Llerena Bastida.

AB  - COVID-19 has further exacerbated trends of widening health inequalities in the UK. Shockingly, the number of years of life lived in general good health differs by over 18 years between the most and least deprived areas of England. Poor diets and obesity are established major risk factors for chronic cardiometabolic diseases and cancer, as well as severe COVID-19. For doctors to provide the best care to their patients, there is an urgent need to improve nutrition education in undergraduate medical school training. With this imperative, the Association for Nutrition established the Inter-Professional Working Group on Medical Education (AfN IPG) to develop a new, modern undergraduate nutrition curriculum for medical doctors. The AfN IPG brought together expertise from nutrition, dietetic and medical professionals, representing the National Health Service, royal colleges, medical schools and universities, government public health departments, learned societies, medical students and nutrition educators. The curriculum was developed with the key objective of being implementable through integration with the current undergraduate training of medical doctors. Through an iterative and transparent consultative process, 13 key nutritional competencies, to be achieved through mastery of 11 graduation fundamentals, were established. The curriculum to facilitate the achievement of these key competencies is divided into eight topic areas, each underpinned by a learning objective statement and teaching points detailing the knowledge and skills development required. The teaching points can be achieved through clinical teaching and a combination of facilitated learning activities and practical skills acquisition. Therefore, the nutrition curriculum enables mastery of these nutritional competencies in a way that will complement and strengthen medical students' achievement of the General Medical Council Outcomes for Graduates. As nutrition is an integrative science, the AfN IPG recommends the curriculum is incorporated into initial undergraduate medical studies before specialist training. This will enable our future doctors to recognise how nutrition is related to multiple aspects of their training, from physiological systems to patient-centred care, and acquire a broad, inclusive understanding of health and disease. In addition, it will facilitate medical schools to embed nutrition learning opportunities within the core medical training, without the need to add in a large number of new components to an already crowded programme or with additional burden to teaching staff. The undergraduate nutrition curriculum for medical doctors is designed to support medical schools to create future doctors who will understand and recognise the role of nutrition in health. Moreover, it will equip front-line staff to feel empowered to raise nutrition-related issues with their patients as a fundamental part of enhanced care and to appropriately refer on for nutrition support with a registered nutritionist (RNutr)/registered associate nutritionist (ANutr) or a registered dietitian (RD) where this is likely to be beneficial.  © 2022 Authors.

AB  - This study presents the use of automated data analysis procedures in the teaching-learning process, mediated by telematics platforms. It is based on the application of the principles of virtual learning, the use of the Internet and the automation of data analysis of information collected in Moodle. The application of analysis procedures for the assessment of music competences is proposed based on the data collected in an exam administered at the end of the course. The sample of the study consists of 1327 students (n = 1327) in the first year of Compulsory Secondary Education in Spain and measures the level of acquisition of the key competences denominated “cultural and artistic”. The results are subjected to the K-means classification technique. This technique is used to obtain homogeneously distributed conglomerates which allow for an objective evaluation of the levels of acquisition of the key musical competences. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Language corpora can play a significant role in second language education, particularly given the benefits of data-driven learning. However, most teachers are not able to effectively utilize technologies that search, summarize, and contextualize corpus samples and lack training in the design and implementation of corpus-based learning tasks and materials. Even though attempts to implement formal teacher training in these areas have started to emerge, they tend to concentrate on English language contexts. Similar experiences in Spanish teacher education are almost non-existent, even though digital literacy is a key competency in the preparation of foreign language teachers. Consequently, Spanish language teachers can only rely on general suggestions on how to integrate corpus methods and resources into their practice. This article reviews the scholarly literature on teacher training on pedagogical uses of corpora and describes ways in which Spanish pre- and in-service teachers can be trained in the use of corpus tools. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This research produces a content analysis of a U.S. social entrepreneurship (SE)–focused graduate management program which examines the intersection of SE key competencies and SE practices that produce avenues of accessibility for SE MBA students. This paper puts previously proposed SE key competencies in dialogue with theories of practice, identifying how curricular and practicum practices are performed through an examination of public-facing program documentation, which includes websites, social media, and curricula. Results show that social capitals are manifest in SE practices that work both internally and externally to define the SE field and foster meaningful SE education. Four patterns of practice are crucial to creating accessibility and engaging multiple stakeholders: institutional practices which instill an active and outward-facing institutional presence, practices of a student-centered organization that bridge and link entrepreneurs, valuation practices incorporating sustainability, and persistent external engagements. These findings provide a roadmap to guide management programs in creating knowledgeable and effective social entrepreneurs, and suggest that this multi-pronged approach to creating SE pathways of practice addresses the complex and pluralistic problems that lie at the core of social innovation projects. © 2022 The Author

AB  - Methods are often thought of as neutral tools that researchers can pick up and use to learn about a reality ‘out there.’ Motivated by growing recognition of complexity, there have been widespread calls to mix methods, both within and across disciplines, to generate richer scientific understandings and more effective policy interventions. However, bringing methods together often reveals their tacit, inherently contestable, and sometimes directly opposing assumptions about reality and how it can and should be known. There are consequently growing efforts to identify the competencies necessary to work with multiple methods effectively. We identify the ability to recognise and negotiate the ethical-political dimensions of research methods as a key competency in mixed methods, inter- and transdisciplinary, and co-production research, particularly for researchers addressing societal challenges in fields like environment, health and education. We describe these ethical-political dimensions by drawing on our experiences developing an ethics application for a transdisciplinary sustainability science project that brings together the photovoice method and controlled behavioural experiments. The first dimension is that different methods and methodological approaches generate their own ethical standards guiding interactions between researchers and participants that may contradict each other. The second is that these differing ethical standards are directly linked to the variable effects that methods have in wider society (both in terms of their enactment in the moment and the knowledge generated), raising more political questions about the kinds of realities that researchers are contributing to through their chosen methods. We identify the practices that helped us—as two researchers using different methodological approaches—to productively explore these dimensions and enrich our collaborative work. We conclude with pointers for evaluating the ethical-political rigour of mixed methods, inter- and transdisciplinary, and co-production research, and discuss how such rigour might be supported in research projects, graduate training programmes and research organisations. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Higher education institutions across Europe are called to offer entrepreneurship education. Despite the rising interest and the increased offerings in the last decades, entrepreneurship education is yet not as mature as other disciplines, and it is still underdeveloped in some faculties and institutions. One way of embedding entrepreneurship education within different disciplines is to take a broader approach beyond teaching how to start up and focusing on developing the entrepreneurial competences of students, which equip them to provide value to society (either economic, social, or cultural). This article describes an online platform—named EICAA—that supports educators and trainers aiming at teaching/guiding/coaching students or employees in developing entre/intrapreneurial competences. The platform is based on a Competence Framework built upon a systematic literature review, which defines 18 key competences grouped in three competence areas. The platform allows the educator to assess the entrepreneurial competences of a group of students/participants, via the so-called Competence Monitor and provides tailor-made training with the Competence Development Kit. The platform is being used in five European universities and is open to be used by any higher education institution or organisation aiming at developing the entrepreneurial competences of their students and/or employees. Future developments of the tool can be enriched from the experiences of the participant institutions and could become an open collaborative online tool. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop a measure of practitioner sense of competence when treating children with disruptive behaviours. Design/methodology/approach: Two online surveys were conducted with health, social work and psychology practitioners (n = 113 and n = 239, respectively) working within varied Australian clinical settings. Study 1 developed scale items and conducted an exploratory factor analysis of the initial Professional Sense of Competence Scale (ProSOCS). Study 2 conducted confirmatory factor analysis and tested the construct validity of the scale. Findings: Study 1 established a three-factor model, which accounted for 56.9% of variance in the ProSOCS items. Study 2 confirmed the three-factor model and considered an alternative unidimensional model. Study 2 demonstrated good convergent validity with measures of knowledge and general sense of competence. Originality/value: The ProSOCS is a valid and reliable way to measure three subscales of a more global composite score of practitioner sense of competence when treating children with disruptive behaviours. Disruptive behaviour represents one of the most common reasons for child presentation in mental health care settings. Understanding how sense of competence among professionals who treat disruptive behaviours in children relates to their level of training, treatment decisions and outcomes could help to enhance use of evidence-based treatment strategies and complement strategies for measuring competence-based training in post-graduate settings. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The food-energy-water (FEW) nexus framework calls for a systems perspective on addressing complex sustainability challenges. As a sustainability science field, nexus research should in theory bring together transdisciplinary approaches drawing from a range of stakeholder knowledge and experiences. This approach would align with the competence-based training for future sustainability leaders advocated for in sustainability education literature. In practice, the field is dominated by techno-scientific approaches with superficial or peripheral attention paid to issues of social justice and community engagement. In this article, we explore how this imbalance in the literature reflects a breakdown between the ideals of sustainability training and the reality of training at the nexus and describe obstacles that may be contributing to this breakdown, including a prejudice towards the idea of “objective” science, institutional incentives, and disciplinary culture. To address these concerns, we introduce a research project focused on assessing the training of future researchers at the FEW nexus and exploring how these programs train students in particular views of what is important at the FEW nexus, such as technological solutions, stakeholder collaboration, and/or issues of equity and justice. It will also provide recommendations for creating open learning environments that are competence-based, and that incorporate multiple methods, acknowledgments of limitations, and alternate ways of knowing. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Contemporary education in higher education institutions has a goal to provide necessary competences determined by legislative demands, science trends and job market needs to graduated students intending to strengthen their employability. The main idea of this research is to assess the level of students’ competences for lifelong learning (LLL). Since it is a very complex task, it is characterized by a lack of information and the vagueness of the inherently subjective nature of human thinking. The uncertain values of the assessed level of students’ competences for LLL are represented by linguistic expressions which are modeled by the interval type 2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Ranking of the level of students’ competences for LLL is stated as a fuzzy multi-criteria optimization task. The aggregation of students’ opinions into unique marks is given by using the proposed fuzzy Delphi technique. The rank of students’ competences for LLL is given by using the proposed fuzzy Simple Additive Weighting (FSAW). The order of measures that should be delivered to improve students’ competences is based on the obtained rank. The model is tested and discussed on the real data collected from a significant sample of the students with a proposal of future directions of the research. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The article deals with the problem of realization of the competence-based approach under the regional cluster model of the development of professional education in the frames of modern challenges for the society and education. The strategic trends of improving professional education have been revealed. The possibilities to develop competence-based approach in higher education are shown. The analysis of questionnaires’ results of graduates, teachers and employers is carried out. The problem field of improving higher education in regional conditions is revealed on the basis of the competence-based approach. The reorientation of education systems to a new, competency-based paradigm is associated with the accession of the Republic of Belarus and other countries to the Bologna Process, which marked the beginning of ambitious reforms in higher education. In most of the national educational systems in Europe, in the last decade, it has become evident that there has been a shift from controlling “inputs” to monitoring to controlling “outputs” of the educational process. Thus, the emphasis has shifted to educational outcomes. The main thing in assessing the effectiveness of educational activities of universities are the results of education: knowledge, competencies and skills got by students, including their independent learning and self-education. The focus of attention is increasingly shifting to a competence-based approach. The competence-based approach, focusing on the result of education, considers as a result not the sum of the assimilated information, but the person’s ability to act productively in his career. Competence-based education is aimed at the development of knowledge and methods of practical activity that ensure successful functioning of a person. Competence-based approach, can guarantee quality of a graduate’s training and determines his readiness for an independent life and productive professional activity, which creates the preconditions for a higher mobility of young specialists in a dynamically changing labor market. © 2022, RJ4All Publications.

AB  - Entrepreneurship is a key competence for anyone intending to be an active citizen and obtain employment. Entrepreneurial education is therefore essential at all levels of education and in every field, not only in business and/or engineering. The aims of this study are: to assess the entrepreneurial intent of students in the final years of the Primary Education degree in the Basque Country; to analyze the factors that influence and hinder these students’ development of entrepreneurial intent in their faculties; and to identify actions for improvement. An online questionnaire consisting of 31 questions was used. The participating sample consisted of students in the final years of the Primary Education degree in the Basque Country, Spain. A total of 168 subjects responded to the questionnaire. After conducting reliability and validity tests, the data indicated that the average intention to start a business after completing their studies was 3.47/10. The majority focused on taking a civil-service examination for a job, becoming employees and/or continuing their education, as a sign of their vocation for children, lack of training in entrepreneurial skills and their aspiration to have better working conditions, among others. Faculties of education often fail to encourage entrepreneurship among their students, highlighting these the lack of internationalization, absence of information about entrepreneurship public and private programs and infrastructures, and nonparticipation in entrepreneurship extra-curricular programs and research. However, faculties of education excel in active methodologies, social engagement, and the use of educational resources. © 2022 Paños-Castro et al.

AB  - Learning outcomes sought through collaborative practices are well-studied and include improvements in student academic skills and achievement. Based on the large body of research that supports this claim, higher education faculty may seek to develop collaborative learning practices for their courses. However, this can be a challenge when a clearly defined theoretical process for transforming a traditional pedagogical approach into one that is collaborative is missing. This paper seeks to address this gap and provide practical guidance through a comprehensive approach that systematically transforms siloed learning into collaborative learning. This approach identifies three key attributes and four key competencies that transform a fragmented team of individual learners into an interdependent, self-sustaining collaborative team. A theoretical model for the process is provided, which demonstrates how this transformation occurs. © Common Ground Research Networks, Natalie Dick, Natalie Brahm, Thuy Bui, Yi Li, Sharon Melincavage, Xintong Wang, Liang Xu, Jana Asher, All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Digital competence in teaching can be understood as the set of skills, attitudes and abilities to use technologies critically and creatively, both in the personal and professional environment. Likewise, it is one of the eight key competencies for lifelong learning. In this paper, in line with the Common Digital Competence Framework (DigComp), we analyze the self-perception of teacher trainees’ digital competence to communicate and collaborate with other people. Additionally, we state the existence of statistically significant differences from a gender perspective (women/men). In this sense, we have carried out non-experimental quantitative research that has a descriptive nature. To this end, we used a questionnaire as an instrument for collecting information, with a total sample of 698 pre-service teachers in Andalusia (Spain). The results show that teacher trainees have an intermediate level in terms of their abilities to communicate and collaborate with other people through digital technologies. At the same time, significant differences are highlighted regarding participants’ gender, which implies that gender can still be considered a limitation in the use of ICTs, thereby decreasing participants’ digital competence. Finally, this study sheds light on the need to improve future teachers’ digital competence. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - To respond to global issues positively, education systems in higher education institutions play a significant role in empowering learners as well as promoting sustainable development goals. By implementing curricula that cultivate cross-cutting and transversal key competencies for sustainability, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration, we prepare our pupils to become sustainability citizens, who not only sustain learning throughout their lives in various circumstances and across different disciplines but also engage constructively and responsibly toward any future world’s challenges through their dispositions, strategies, and skills. One such sustainable teaching methodology is known as the flipped classroom, an active-learning, student-centered, flexible, and multidimensional pedagogy. Our objective is to investigate the effect of such pedagogy on learners’ academic achievement and their attitude toward mathematics using both quantitative and qualitative methods. We cultivated sustainable learning in mathematics education for college freshmen ((Formula presented.)) by exposing them to both the conventional teaching method (CTM) and flipped classroom pedagogy (FCP). By splitting them into control and experimental groups alternately ((Formula presented.), (Formula presented.)) and by selecting the four most challenging topics in college algebra, we measured their cognitive gains quantitatively via a sequence of pre- and post-tests. The topics are factorization, rational expressions, radical operations, and applied problems. Both groups improved academically over time across all these four topics with statistically very significant outcomes (Formula presented.). Although they were not always statistically significant ((Formula presented.)) in some topics, the post-test results suggest that generally, the FCP trumps the CTM in cognitive gains, except for the first topic on factorization, where the opposite is true with a very statistically significant mean difference (Formula presented.). By examining non-cognitive gains qualitatively, we analyzed the students’ feedback on the FCP and their responses to a perception inventory. The finding suggests a favorable response toward the FCP with primary improvements in the attitudes toward mathematics and increased levels of cooperation among students. Since these students are so happy to have control of their own learning, they were more relaxed, motivated, confident, active, and responsible in learning under the FCP. We are confident that although this study is relatively small in scale, it will yield incremental and long-lasting effects not only for the learners themselves but also for other role-takers in education sectors who aspire in nurturing sustainable long-life learning and achieving sustainable development goals successfully. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: This special issue reveals how lesson study in China continues to serve as a powerful platform to support change in teaching. The papers included in this issue explore how university faculty members and researchers support teachers to cross boundaries resulting from the introduction of key competencies-based (hexin suyang 核心素养) curriculum reform (KCR). Design/methodology/approach: The theme of continuity and change is examined against the backdrop of Chinese lesson study's (CLS's) consistent supporting role in enabling curriculum reform. These analyses make use of concepts involved in understanding boundary crossing, such as using boundary objects and their roles, to help make sense of the new theories, tools, and resources as well as relationships engendered in responding to the reform's demand. While recognizing the continuity at play in Chinese LS, the authors use the lens of learning at the boundary of research-practice partnerships (RPPs) (Farrell et al., 2022) to contemplate the future of CLS. Findings: The papers touch on three major themes: (1) the role of university-school partnerships in meeting the new demands of key competencies reform; (2) resourceful tools, strategies and structures to support boundary crossing for teachers; and (3) roles and relationships for mutual learning in university-school partnerships. Together these three themes, considered across the papers in this issue, point to the need to redefine CLS to engender versatility and hybridity and to enlist mutual learning relationships in future university-school partnerships. Such redefinition positions lesson study to both continue and change. Research limitations/implications: The papers in this issue are expected to promote mutualist learning in future CLS research-practice partnerships. To do so, research needs to move from focusing on change of a single case teacher to clarifying what experts and teachers each learn from the LS and from each other. Attention also needs to focus on the collaborative discourse and ways such discourse is able to promote mutual learning, emotional support in facing change as well as critical and constructive problem solving. Practical implications: Practically, to better support boundary crossing, this special issue encourages academics and teachers to identify and work around boundary objects and their enabling features to enhance knowledge and identity of both university and teacher participants for more effective research-practice partnerships. Originality/value: This special issue offers a pioneering set of studies that contributes to an in-depth understanding of how CLS is supporting the current competencies-based reform in China. It also provides concrete future directions for research and practice to enhance university-school partnerships' response to reform. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Teacher training is directly related to the quality of the educational process. In recent years, the contributions of neuroeducation have begun to be valued as an important element to improve teachers’ skills. The current study has the objective of measuring the effectiveness of a teacher training program in neuroeducation through the improvement of three key competencies, reading, mathematical, social, emotional and moral competencies in secondary school students. This quasi-experimental study was carried out over two years, in which there have been two experimental and one control group, with 209 participants from all three schools in the same town of Spain (53.2% girls and 46.8% boys). The subjects are from all the classes of 1st grade of Secondary Education in the pre-test (M = 12.18 years old, SD =.45). After carrying out a repeated-measures ANOVA, the results show a significant effect of the intervention on reading competence, mathematical competence and empathy (social and emotional area) between the experimental groups and the control one. These findings invite us to think about the potential of neuroeducation in schools and have implications for educational policies, teacher training and school practice. © 2022 Universidad de País Vasco

AB  - Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have been incorporating sustainability into education and curricula, where recent research has focussed on sustainability competences, pedagogical approaches, and how to connect them, generally on a single HEI. The process of integrating sustainability into education based on curricula assessment has been explained using adoption of innovations; and has the potential to explain the process of developing competences through pedagogical approaches. The aim of this paper is to investigate this process at academic discipline level. An online survey was developed to investigate teaching sustainability competences in 13 HEIs, from which 678 responses from educators were obtained. The competences and pedagogical approaches from the responses were ranked, and then the connections between the competences and pedagogical approaches per discipline were analysed using a correlations-based framework, from which three disciplines groups were created. The groups were categorised using diffusion of innovations theory, which indicated that some disciplines are more innovative than others in adopting sustainability competence-based teaching. The results are used to propose two frameworks to better understand the adoption of sustainability competence-based teaching: (a) the D-RAPID framework; and (b) the Disciplinary Multi-dimensional Sustainability Influence Change for Academia (D-MuSICA) memework. The adoption of sustainability competence-base education must expand from a single HEI perspective to a disciplinary collaborative one spanning many HEIs, where academic disciplines should learn from each other's insights and mistakes and provide students with more transdisciplinary skillsets to make societies more sustainable. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - This study presented the practices of pupil behaviour management of Vietnamese primary teachers with a focus on primary pupils’ misbehaviours, and the activities the primary teachers implemented to manage this misbehaviour. 1,545 primary pupils’ parents and teachers from all three main areas in Vietnam took part in the questionnaire surveys. Mathematical statistical methods were used to analyse data along with collating the perceptions between primary teachers and parents. The results showed that pupil behaviour management had been implemented to a positive extent by the primary teachers in classroom practices. The primary teachers frequently implemented the activities of pupil behaviour management to deal with pupils’ misbehaviours, and this could help prevent misbehaviour in classroom practices. Nevertheless, the study also revealed that one of the emergent problems that needs to be solved in order to achieve better pupil behaviour management is pupils’ inattentive attitudes in learning. A possible reason was attributed to the teachers’ less cares and the lower frequency with which interactive instruction was implemented by the primary teachers in their teaching practices. The study suggested that an appropriate strategy of pupil behaviour management for Vietnamese primary teachers needed to be designed in order to help better engage pupils in learning and to meet the requirements of the ongoing implementation of competence-based curricula. A social constructivist approach with its interactive and meaningful features was recommended for further studies to work on designing an appropriate behaviour management strategy for pupils in a Confucian heritage culture such as Vietnam. © 2022 NAPCE.

AB  - In the digital age, robotics education has gained much attention for cultivating learners’ design thinking, creative thinking, critical thinking, and cooperative abilities. In particular, critical thinking as one of the key competencies in Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) can stimulate imagination and creation. It is of great value to explore critical thinking cultivation in robot programming learning. Therefore, this study applied different teaching tools to take the content of “making a manipulator through programming and construction” in a robotics course as an experimental context to examine the promotion of learners’ critical thinking. Before the experiment, a pre-test was conducted to measure students’ critical thinking ability. Then, all students were divided randomly into two groups: one as an experimental group with the teaching tool of Construction–Criticism–Migration (CCM) instructional design, and the other as a control group with the traditional teaching tool of demonstrate–practice instructional design. After a 6-week experiment, the measurement of critical thinking was applied as a post-test. SPSS was used to conduct an independent sample t test and one-way ANOVA to explore whether students’ critical thinking ability had improved and whether differences were found between the experimental group and the control group after the 6-week experiment. The results showed that the experimental group students’ critical thinking ability significantly improved, whereas no significant difference was found before and after the experiment for the control group. A significant difference existed between the two groups. This study provides an example of a new instructional design teaching tool for the teaching of robot programming and can provide valuable suggestions for instructors in middle schools. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - International mobility programmes embed higher education (HE) students in a learning process in which they gain key knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs), some of them crucial in pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We propose an innovative theoretical framework that links such KSAs to the UNESCO’s Key Competences for Sustainability and specific SDGs. Moreover, we analysed which KSAs are addressed by institutional initiatives to support mobility students, exposing their contribution to the SDGs. Finally, we revised mobile students’ needs of institutional support on KSA’s acquisition through focus groups. Results show that the KSAs most addressed by the institutional initiatives are related to several SDGs, but mainly to SDG4 (Quality Education) and SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). Notwithstanding, additional institutional support may be needed for students to leverage their learning outcomes and transform international mobility into a key driver of the necessary social change towards the achievement of SDGs. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: This research aims to investigate the role of project-based-learning within graduate sustainability curricula through the lens of key competence development. Project-based learning has become a widely recommended pedagogy for sustainability education. It is hypothesized that through collaboration, student autonomy and real-world application, students develop key competencies for sustainability. This paper also aims to examine the connection between project-based learning and competence development on a program level from the student perspective. Design/methodology/approach: This two-year comparative case study follows the project-based-learning journeys of nine graduate sustainability students from three programs: the Master’s of Sustainability at Arizona State University, the Master’s of Sustainability Science at Leuphana University of Lüneburg and the Global Sustainability Science Master’s, an ASU and Leuphana collaboration. Over four semesters, the students each took part in four competence-oriented self-assessments and interviews to map their perceived learning throughout their programs. Additional contextual information was gathered from program and course materials and descriptions, instructor interviews and in vivo observations. Findings: The defining aspects of project-based learning including collaboration, student autonomy and real-world connection do contribute to students’ self-perceived competence development. Student-driven and program-driven project-based learning experiences equally foster this result, as long as the pedagogical challenges of balancing support and student independence associated with each are mitigated through instructor actions, program design or individual student coping skills. Originality/value: The results of this research can support higher education institutions in designing sustainability programs aimed at competence development through project-based learning. The focus on the curricular and program level combined with repeated overtime student-reported attribution to specific courses and activities bridges the gap between individual course case studies and theoretical recommendations for curriculum design. In addition to length and depth, this study also forefronts student experience of curricula as delivered. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The teaching practices of mathematics are still little-known in Rwandan schools though the Competence-Based Curriculum (CBC) and many pedagogical documents recommend how to assess, what to assess, and when to assess the effective teaching of mathematics. This study aimed to assess Rwandan mathematics teachers’ practices through pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). We sampled 14 mathematics teachers having similar educational backgrounds. Seven of them were sampled from Teacher Training Colleges (TTC), and the other seven were non-TTC teachers (selected from general secondary schools). We adopted a pedagogic approach to analyze the assessment practices and the tasks proposed by teachers to students. We also analyzed 35 items related to pedagogical content knowledge for teaching (PCK) among these two groups of teachers. Although the results about differences between two groups of seven teachers were not considered robust differences, it was still revealed that in all item categories related to PCK, TTC teachers have less performance than non-TTC teachers. The lack of mastery of content and specialized knowledge at the university level was found to cause this. We also found challenges related to teachers’ assessment skills, especially mathematical complexity, as indicated by the interview results. We, therefore, recommend that all teachers, especially TTC teachers, be offered training in content knowledge so that they strengthen their teaching practices. © Mathematics Teaching-Research Journal 2022.

AB  - As lecturers and researchers in translation and interpreting, we are aware of the need to design curricula so that students are well equipped, and able to respond to the requirements of modern society. In the world today, there is an evident gap between what is actually taught in higher education and what should be taught to meet student needs. Even though various studies have already focused on the impact of constructs, such as self-regulation, empathy, or creativity, on performance quality, there is still a long way to go. In order to bridge this gap and highlight the role of the university as a transformational agent, our study uses LifeComp, the European framework for the personal, social, and learning to learn key competence. The objective of this research was firstly to discover the transversal competences that are most highly valued by employers in the language industry sector; and secondly, to identify the competences that need more attention in curricula. For this purpose, a questionnaire-based study was designed and administered to translation companies based in Spain. The results obtained indicate that these competences are necessary to foster employability as well as real wealth creation in a lifelong learning context. This study is part of a broader project within the LifeComp framework, in which a competence-based psycho-educational intervention was designed and is now integrated in the translation and interpreting degree programme at the University of Granada (Spain). © 2022 Universidad de Cordoba,Servicio de Publicaciones.

AB  - The study purpose is to investigate the development of creativity in the process of knowledge management in the advertising industry. The novelty of the research is in the study of creativity and social intelligence management as key competencies of this industry. The study is motivated by the high need for continuous improvement in the quality of training of employees in the advertising industry. The respondents group for the online study was formed by simple randomisation from representatives of the advertising industry in the Russian Federation (42 people) and China (45 people). The training methodology consisted of several online exercises in the form of situational tasks aimed at stimulating creativity as well as the development of communicative, image qualities and social intelligence. Statistical analysis was performed using STATISTICA 13.3 software (StatSoft Inc.). To compare quantitative data in the group of respondents before and after the training, a paired Student’s t-test was used to test the null hypothesis about the absence of statistically significant differences in the results of tests of creativity and other significant variables for pre- and post-test after applying the training methodology. The null hypothesis was rejected. The research has shown the possibilities of stimulation of creative potential and development of active thinking, its fluency and flexibility by means of training sessions. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - With recognition to the importance of the royal initiative Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) as the guiding principle of national development and its role as a main driver to accomplish the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs), Siam University decided to repositioning our institution, education program, and learning ecosystem accordingly. It was agreed that our students needed to learn more about how to apply SEP in practice and that they need to be nurtured and educated more about sustainable development. A research team was then appointed with 2 missions (1) to investigate students’ key competencies for sustainability in the 21st Century as needed by students and instructors and (2) to design and propose a model to transform general education program and learning for SEP and sustainable development (SD). A mixed methods approach, using document research, questionnaire, and focus group discussion, was employed. Five domains and 30 characteristics were identified as key competencies for sustainability in the 21st Century. Needs assessment questionnaire was distributed to 440 students and 160 instructors and analyzed by Modified Priority Needs Index (PNI Modified). It was found that both students and instructors ranked “appreciation, understanding, and commitment to apply the principle of sustainable development (SD) and Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) in daily life and global/social issues” as first priority (PNI Modified = 0.17, 0.36), “appreciation and preservation of Thai identity and Thai culture” as second (PNI Modified = 0.15, 0.34), and “concern, awareness and understanding global/social issues, and their impacts” as third (PNI Modified = 0.14, 0.28). Results of the study were then used as a basis in designing our general education program. The Triangle of Living Learning Lab model was then proposed as a model to transform GE program and learning for SEP and SD. © 2022, Education Research Institute, Seoul National University.

AB  - Digital competence is among the basic key competences for digital learning and employability. For this reason, its acquisition and development should be on the agenda of higher education institutions (HEIs) who wish to prepare their students to thrive in an ever faster evolving digital labour market. However, the existence of a valid instrument that can help HEIs measuring and further integrating digital competence into pedagogical and organisational practices with sufficient precision is yet to be accomplished. This article provides a valid and reliable instrument to measure higher education students' digital competence on the basis of the European Digital Competence Framework for Citizens, also known as DigComp. The instrument was applied to a sample of 411 students from a mid-large public HEI and the results attest its validity and reliability. In addition, the study explores proficiency differences among students from different fields of education and training, and gender. Results demystify the idea that ICT students are more digitally competent than those in other fields of study, but suggest males score higher than females, which feeds into the ongoing debate of gender differences in relation to digital technologies and the readiness of females for the digital labour market. The results lead to clear implications for research and practice. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Digital competence is critical for higher education (HE) students to benefit from digital learning, strive in a digital society and increase employability prospects. There is a lack of valid instruments to measure higher education (HE) students' digital competence and facilitate the identification of digital competence gaps. Few studies focus on the relationship between HE students' digital competence, gender and fields of education and training (FET). What this paper adds A valid and reliable instrument based on a common European framework for digital competence. HE students lack the necessary digital competences to effectively cope with digital environments. Digital proficiency is particularly low regarding “Safety”, “Problem solving” and “Digital content creation” competence areas. ICT students show less proficiency than those from other FET. Male students score higher than females. Implications for practice and/or policy The instrument can be adopted by different stakeholders to assess students/future job seekers' digital competence. HE institutions could benefit from such an instrument as a diagnosis to design specific teaching and learning strategies and target students' proficiency and particular needs. Tackling specific FET and competence areas can better support the development of students' digital competence and facilitate their employability prospects. © 2022 British Educational Research Association.

AB  - Purpose: One of the reasons for postgraduate trainees not to choose working in a rural area is uncertainty related to the lack of competencies. The aim of this study was to investigate the concept of uncertainty by measuring competencies and to examine the psychometric properties of an instrument that measures competencies related to uncertainty in the self-assessment of postgraduate trainees in family medicine. Patients and Methods: A questionnaire was created based on pre-existing instruments. It was distributed to participants of postgraduate training seminars in the federal states of Baden-Württemberg and Schleswig-Holstein, Germany in 2016. Descriptive statistics and a partial correlation analysis were calculated for measuring the degree of association between year of postgraduate training and items’ responses. Psychometric properties were assessed by calculating descriptive item analysis, factor analysis and internal consistency. Results: The response rate was 85% (105/124). More than one-fifth of the participants stated to show only seldom or sometimes the following skills: ability to balance work and life (N=25, 24%), letting a mild disorder run its own way (N=24, 23%) and ability to conduct interventions that decreased aggression from the patient (N=22, 21%). More than half of the participants felt (very) insecure in performing routine child check-ups, the application of a below elbow backslab and the partial removal of a toenail. Nine out of 21 items showed positive statistically significant correlation between level of competence and progress in training. Factor analysis led to a final instrument with 12 items (Cronbach’s α=0.736) and a three-factor-structure: “doctor well-being and resilience”, “communication” and “skills”. Conclusion: In order to reduce uncertainty with all its consequences, a focus on teaching of competencies regarding the physicians’ well-being and resilience, communication and skills has to be continued in postgraduate training. © 2022 Flägel et al.

AB  - This paper presents an empirical study on key competencies for sustainable development. Over a period of two years, we collected empirical data on competencies of senior sustainability professionals by using an action research approach. Data collection took place in Belgium Flanders via an elaborate iterative action-reflection process including an interactive workshop, interviews, and an online survey. Our analysis provides strong empirical evidence for the existence of two complemen-tary competency clusters, namely sustainability research competencies and sustainability intervention competencies. Together they enable the profound analysis and understanding of sustainability issues and ensure the ability to devise solutions and foster change towards sustainability. Furthermore, we shed a first light on the interaction of these competency clusters and their link with the practitioners’ topical knowledge and lived experience. This study bridges the divergence in literature between theoretically and empirically driven research and offers novel insights on sustainability competencies for the fields of sustainability science, human resource management, and higher education. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: The present study proposes coaching as a pedagogical intervention to prepare students for transitioning to the labour market. Taking a competence-based approach, the proposed coaching practice aims to enhance students' employability competences to facilitate a smoother school-to-work transition. However, what transition coaching looks like remains largely unclear. Moreover, in competence-based education, teachers are expected to be highly skilled coaches, facilitating students' transition to the labour market. The present study aims to map the core competencies of a transition coach. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative design was adopted to map the core competences of a transition coach. Data were collected from two focus groups, consisting of coaches in higher education and in the workplace. Findings: Results show that, to create the necessary support conditions, a coach creates a safe coaching environment and supports students in setting goals, guide them in the activities they undertake to attain these goals, and asks reflective questions. Moreover, the coach stimulates students' ownership by putting the student in the centre of the decision-making process. Furthermore, the results emphasize the importance of the coach's professional attitude and knowledge about the transition process and the labour market. Practical implications: The article concludes with practical implications for novice transition coaches and teachers in higher education. Originality/value: The present study adds to the agenda of graduate work readiness by proposing a coaching practice aimed at preparing students for their transition to the labour market. © 2022, Niels van der Baan, Inken Gast, Wim Gijselaers and Simon Beausaert.

AB  - Self-directed learning is generally considered a key competence in higher education. To enable self-directed learning, assessment practices increasingly embrace assessment for learning rather than the assessment of learning, shifting the focus from grades and scores to provision of rich, narrative, and personalized feedback. Students are expected to collect, interpret, and give meaning to this feedback, in order to self-assess their progress and to formulate new, appropriate learning goals and strategies. However, interpretation of aggregated, longitudinal narrative feedback has been proven to be very challenging, cognitively demanding, and time consuming. In this article, we, therefore, explored the applicability of existing, proven text mining techniques to support feedback interpretation. More specifically, we investigated whether it is possible to automatically generate meaningful information about prevailing topics and the emotional load of feedback provided in medical students' competence-based portfolios (N = 1500), taking into account the competence framework and the students' various performance levels. Our findings indicate that the text-mining techniques topic modeling and sentiment analysis make it feasible to automatically unveil the two principal aspects of narrative feedback, namely the most relevant topics in the feedback and their sentiment. This article, therefore, takes a valuable first step toward the automatic, online support of students, who are tasked with meaningful interpretation of complex narrative data in their portfolio as they develop into self-directed life-long learners.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.

AB  - This research examines the connection between higher education curricula for sustainable development and student development of key competencies for sustainability. The authors conducted a comparative case study that followed ten students from three graduate sustainability programs. Through a combination of student-generated and contextual data, we created a set of learning journeys. These journeys showed that activities which foster reflection, interaction, and real-world connections are especially critical for competence development as part of the whole curriculum. What and how students found most useful depended on individual disposition and we identified four general categories based on prior experience, attitude to learning, and individual goals. Barriers to competency development were frustration, feelings of helplessness, and being unable to link competence to concrete activities or concepts. These barriers could be mitigated through peer interaction and mentorship, environmental support such as spaces for collaboration, and instructor scaffolding. Because no single course can fit the needs of each student, we recommend that beneficial components in the form of courses that support the above-mentioned activities be part of purposeful curriculum design. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Information Literacy (IL) has been named a key competence for the twenty-first century and is being progressively introduced in many compulsory school curricula. Nonetheless, the actual implementation of effective IL education cannot be carried out without the sound preparation of teachers. This study explores the naïve, pre-instruction conceptions of online information searching of pre-service pre-primary and primary teachers through the structured qualitative analysis of participant-produced screencasts. The results indicate that teachers have a mainly technical view of IL, leading them to focus on basic computer literacy skills (e.g., how to use a search engine) and to overlook mental processes (e.g., the definition of an information need or strategy). Implications for the development of pre-service teachers’ IL education are discussed. © 2022 Author(s).

AB  - Research indicates that refugee and asylum seeker children and young people often require specialised psychological support. Competencies have been established as helpful in guiding the training, education and ongoing professional development of practitioners working in specialised areas. To date there has been no comprehensive review of the literature concerning practitioner competencies for working with refugee or asylum seeker children and young people. This scoping review therefore aimed to synthesise all literature regarding practitioner competencies that are considered important for working in the area of mental health with refugee and asylum seeker children and young people. Literature was sourced from PsycINFO, Scopus, and PubMed. Studies were included if they: a) were published in peer-reviewed journals, b) were published in English, c) were published in the last 25 years, d) collected primary data, e) related to children and/or young people (defined as aged under 25) with refugee or asylum seeker backgrounds, and f) discussed practitioner competencies (in relation to refugee or asylum seeker children or young people). Nine articles met criteria and a deductive thematic analysis identified six key competencies: 1) knowledge of the complexity of needs of refugees; 2) use of holistic approaches; 3) ability to work in co-ordination with others in the child's network; 4) ability to build therapeutic relationships; 5) seeking feedback; and 6) cultural competency. Further empirical research that directly aims to identify practitioner competencies, from both the practitioner and client perspective, will support the challenging work done by practitioners working with refugee and asylum seeker children and young people. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: Risk literacy, i.e., the ability to calculate and apply risk parameters, represents a key competence for risk communication and medical decision making. However, risk literacy is reportedly low in medical students. The successful acquisition of statistical competencies is often difficult, and can be hampered by emotional learning obstacles, calling for interventions to support learning. In this cluster-randomized study, we aimed to translate findings from placebo research to medical education. Specifically, we tested if the acquisition of risk literacy during a seminar unit can be facilitated by positive expectations, induced by a positive and non-threatening framing of the content and learning goals. Methods: The study took place during a mandatory 2.5-h seminar on “risk literacy” for 2nd year medical students. The seminar teaches both statistical knowledge and its application in patient communication. To test the effects of expectations on risk literacy acquisition, the (otherwise identical) seminar was framed either as “communication training” (positive framing condition) or “statistics seminar” (negative framing condition). All N = 200 students of the semester were invited to participate, and cluster-randomized to the positive or negative framing condition (4 seminar groups each condition). Risk literacy was assessed with the “Quick Risk Test” (QRT) at the beginning and end of the seminar, along with statistics anxiety and subjective learning success using questionnaires. Results: Data from N = 192 students were included. At the end of the seminar, risk literacy was increased in both framing conditions, with a significantly greater increase in QRT scores in the positive framing condition. Statistics anxiety was significantly decreased in both framing conditions, with no evidence of group differences. Subjective learning success was overall high and comparable between groups. Conclusions: Supporting our hypothesis, positive framing led to a significantly greater increase in risk literacy (i.e., in QRT scores). Our data offer first support that positive framing of learning goals may help to facilitate the acquisition of statistical knowledge. Expectation-orientated interventions may thus offer a feasible tool to optimize learning settings and framing of learning objectives in medical statistics courses. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - We present a script for conversational reflection guidance embedded in reflective practice. Rebo Junior, a nonadaptive conversational agent, was evaluated in a 12-week field study with apprentices. We analyzed apprentices' interactions with Rebo Junior in terms of reflectivity and measured the development of their reflection competence via reflective essays at three points in time during the field study. Reflection competence, a key competency for lifelong professional learning, becomes significantly higher by the third essay after repeated interactions with Rebo Junior (paired samples t-test t13 = 3.00, p = 0.010 from Essay 1 to Essay 3). However, we also observed a significant decrease in reflectivity in the Rebo Junior interactions over time (paired samples t-test between the first and eighth interaction: t7 = 2.50, p = 0.041). We attribute this decline to 1) the novelty of Rebo Junior wearing off (novelty effect) and 2) the apprentices learning the script and experiencing subsequent frustration due to the script not fading over time. Overall, this work 1) informs future design through the observation of consistent decreases in engagement over eight interactions with static scaffolding, 2) contributes a reflection script applicable for reflection on tasks that resemble future expected work tasks, a typical setting in lifelong professional learning, and 3) indicates increased reflection competence after repeated reflection guided by a conversational agent.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Information and communication technologies (ICTs) in basic education, i.e. K12 education, have often been constrained by sociocultural context and limited to pedagogical aspects, and these innovations have not yet catalyzed curriculum reform as expected. To address this research gap, this study adopted a key-competence-based subject knowledge learning tool, i.e. Smart Learning Partner (SLP), and conducted a quasi-experimental study to evaluate its effects among middle school students. A total of 400 participants in Grade 7 from four schools were followed for a period of two and a half years. The results on online learning engagement indicated that the manipulation generally succeeded in promoting students’ use of SLP in the experimental schools. Furthermore, the results on academic performance showed that SLP could not only directly benefit students’ learning in the first academic year but also continued to have an effect within the following one and a half years. This study contributes to the existing knowledge in two aspects: first, it extends the use of an adaptive learning cognitive map and shows positive effects in supporting the implementation of the whole curriculum; second, it presents a long-term and large-scale example of successfully integrating ICTs into the key-competence-based curriculum reform in the Chinese context. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Introduction. This article analyses the impact of an intercultural learning intervention in a Spanish university post-European Higher Education Area implementation. Objective. Our research’s main objective consisted of measuring the development of intercultural competence in the first cohort of a Translation and Intercultural Communication bachelor’s degree in a Spanish university, before and after taking specific courses in intercultural studies and spending a study abroad semester. Methodology. A mixed methodology was implemented, in which the Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) was used as a measuring instrument. Additionally, in-depth personal interviews were conducted to complement the data obtained. Results. The results of this study show that the programming and sequencing of specific courses, together with experiences abroad, contribute to the development of intercultural competence. Conclusions. More intercultural learning interventions are needed in higher education courses to develop and build an intercultural campus and educate global citizens. When applying intercultural learning interventions and intercultural methodologies, students develop their intercultural competence, a key competence for 21st-century graduates. © 2022 Universidad Nacional.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to identify the precise competencies that employers are seeking for big data analytics professions and whether higher education big data programs enable students to acquire the competencies. Design/methodology/approach: This study utilizes a multimethod approach involving three data sources: online job postings, executive interviews and big data programs at universities and colleges. Text mining analysis guided by a holistic competency theoretical framework was used to derive insights into the required competencies. Findings: We found that employers are seeking workers with strong functional and cognitive competencies in data analytics, computing and business combined with a range of social competencies and specific personality traits. The exact combination of competencies required varies with job levels and tasks. Executives clearly indicate that workers rarely possess the competencies and they have to provide additional training. Research limitations/implications: A limitation is our inability to capture workers' perspectives to determine the extent to which they think they have the necessary competencies. Practical implications: The findings can be used by higher educational institutions to design programs to better meet market demand. Job seekers can use it to focus on the types of competencies they need to advance their careers. Policymakers can use it to focus policies and investments to alleviate skills shortages. Industry and universities can use it to strengthen their collaborations. Social implications: Much closer collaborations among public institutions, educational institutions, industry, and community organizations are needed to ensure training programs evolve with the evolving need for skills driven by dynamic technological changes. Originality/value: This is the first study on this topic to adopt a multimethod approach incorporating the perspectives of the key stakeholders in the supply and demand of skilled workers. It is the first to employ text mining analysis guided by a holistic competency framework to derive unique insights. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Numerous studies have highlighted Intercultural Sensitivity (IS) as a key competence in an increasingly multicultural society. This study examined the extent to which a cohort of first year undergraduate students enrolled on the same Didactics course, and in two different training modalities – Service Learning (SL) and non-Service Learning (non-SL) – developed IS. It was based on a quasi-experimental design of repeated pre-test and post-test measures, comparing the two groups. The sample consisted of 233 Spanish students at higher education institutions, and data was collected using the Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI). The SL group displayed significantly higher levels of IS in all factors except in the denial/defence and minimization stages. Results indicated the effectiveness of SL regarding specific subscales within the IDI instrument. The findings add new depth to our understanding regarding which teaching methodologies contribute to the development of IS and to the training of active citizens in Spanish university students. The discussion focuses on the need for intercultural service experiences to promote IS. The results have broad implications for policymakers and educators who are interested in enhancing transformative educational experiences and effective teaching methodologies for developing students’ IS in higher education. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the rapid global spread and application of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), the question is whether every culture makes similar use of the ideology that often underlies its creators’ design. ICT applications are designed with underlying beliefs or principles about e.g., work, communication, and individuality. These beliefs or principles are invisible and hidden in software and, as such, in many instances not recognized by users in other cultures. These hidden principles might even frustrate the understanding, use, knowledge-sharing, and e-collaboration between people from different cultures. In this article, we aim to explore, from a historical point of view, the early years of adaptation of ICT in developing countries, and we will highlight the importance of the use of intercultural (ICT-)skills to learn to recognize cultural differences from a relationship-based definition in technology-mediated collaboration. A semi-systematic or narrative review approach is used that is particularly suitable for topics that have been conceptualized differently. Our review firstly summarizes and categorizes the cultural factors impacting the adaptation and diffusion of ICT, especially in developing countries, and investigates which factors could hinder and/or facilitate the collaboration with other countries. Secondly, the findings of a thorough comparison between different intercultural competencies’ frameworks indicate that intercultural competencies show a combination of motivation, knowledge (-management), and skills, which are key competencies in the light of successful technology-mediated collaboration. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In recent decades, the term “competencies” has been widely discussed and become an impetus for innovating school curriculum and instruction. This study focused on a recent K-12 curriculum reform in Macau with the purpose of exploring the issue of integrating 21st century competencies in the subjects-based curriculum documents, i.e., Requirements of Basic Academic Attainments (RBAAs). Based on an analytical framework of 21st century competencies, the distributions of those competencies embedded in “curriculum goals” of 39 RBAAs across the K-12 schooling were analysed. Key findings can be summarized in three ways: (1) the category of “Ways of thinking” takes the most proportion while that of “Tools for working” takes the least from primary to senior secondary with “Living in the world” being most concerned in pre-primary; (2) discrepancies exist among the distributions of ten 21st century competencies across the K-12 schooling and (3) some competencies are more concerned in some certain learning domains. The results of this study have provided two implications for the issue of integrating 21st century competencies in the school curriculum in the rest of the world: a reasonable relation should be taken between key competencies and curriculum goals and different competencies will be emphasized at different educational stages and for different subjects. © 2020 National Institute of Education, Singapore.

AB  - Background: The 13 core entrustable professional activities (EPAs) are key competency-based learning outcomes in the transition from undergraduate to graduate medical education in the United States. Five of these EPAs (EPA2: Prioritizing differentials, EPA3: Recommending and interpreting tests, EPA4: Entering orders and prescriptions, EPA5: Documenting clinical encounters, and EPA10: Recognizing urgent and emergent conditions) are uniquely suited for web-based assessment. Objective: In this pilot study, we created cases on a web-based simulation platform for the diagnostic assessment of these EPAs and examined the feasibility and acceptability of the platform. Methods: Four simulation cases underwent 3 rounds of consensus panels and pilot testing. Incoming emergency medicine interns (N=15) completed all cases. A maximum of 4 "look for" statements, which encompassed specific EPAs, were generated for each participant: (1) performing harmful or missing actions, (2) narrowing differential or wrong final diagnosis, (3) errors in documentation, and (4) lack of recognition and stabilization of urgent diagnoses. Finally, we interviewed a sample of interns (n=5) and residency leadership (n=5) and analyzed the responses using thematic analysis. Results: All participants had at least one missing critical action, and 40% (6/15) of the participants performed at least one harmful action across all 4 cases. The final diagnosis was not included in the differential diagnosis in more than half of the assessments (8/15, 54%). Other errors included selecting incorrect documentation passages (6/15, 40%) and indiscriminately applying oxygen (9/15, 60%). The interview themes included psychological safety of the interface, ability to assess learning, and fidelity of cases. The most valuable feature cited was the ability to place orders in a realistic electronic medical record interface. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of a web-based platform for diagnostic assessment of specific EPAs. The approach rapidly identifies potential areas of concern for incoming interns using an asynchronous format, provides feedback in a manner appreciated by residency leadership, and informs individualized learning plans. © 2021 Eesti Rakenduslingvistika Uhingu Aastaraamat.

AB  - Traditionally, serious games have been used in the development of hard skills, particularly in technical areas such as health, engineering, defence or the environment. However, they can also be applied in the assessment and development of soft skills, which are increasingly key competencies for an individual in the twenty-first century. In this sense, this study proposes the adoption of the FLIGBY serious game in a higher education institution to evaluate and develop students’ skills in this field. The findings indicate a large correspondence between the soft skills fundamental to the twenty-first century and the assessment dimensions recorded by the game. Furthermore, the findings reveal that FLIGBY can be used primarily to develop skills in dimensions such as leadership, conflict management, diplomacy and emotional intelligence. These findings are relevant for higher education institutions that intend to include and foster the development of soft skills competencies in their curricula. © 2022 Association for Information Technology in Teacher Education.

AB  - The thinking and inquiry abilities of students can be improved effectively only through practical exploration and personal experience. To improve the key competences and promote individual development of students, it is important to arrange experiential teaching pertinently, and handle the learning problems timely, referring to the results of itinerary assessment. This paper explores the influence of experiential teaching and itinerary assessment on the improvement of key competencies of students. Firstly, a regression model was established to evaluate the improvement of students' key competencies, based on stepwise regression. Next, the Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3) model was adopted to classify the tuple of each test sample or research object. Finally, the association rule mining technique was applied to the benchmark evaluation of the improvement of students' key competencies, and the three benchmark evaluation models were synthetized into an integrated model. The effectiveness of the proposed model was demonstrated through experiments. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Entrepreneurial skills and digital competence are two basic competences in people’s education in the 21st century. They are also transversal competences in university degrees. We carried out an analysis of European models, which suggest areas and indicators within these two competencies (entrepreneurial and digital), with the ultimate goal of elaborating an original model of digital entrepreneurship competence, which we have named EmDigital. This analysis was performed by means of a qualitative approach and the combination of documentary analysis techniques, focus-group discussion and expert judgement through the Delphi method in a sequence of four consecutive phases. The proposed EmDigital model encompasses 4 areas, 15 sub-competences and 45 indicators. This model will be useful for the design of descriptive types of tests and certification tests, as well as for the design of formative proposals both for professors and for students of higher studies. Furthermore, the model will lead to new lines of research in the area of competence-based training. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The aim of the present research study is to describe professor beliefs and their role in the teaching of argumentative skills in higher education. An explorative-descriptive study with a qualitative approach is performed. The population surveyed is composed of 16 professors that taught the first two years of philosophy and law undergraduate degrees at a private Chilean university in 2019. Interviews are performed with thematic analysis. The results show high agreement between professors in their beliefs: argumentation is valued as a key competence, but it is suggested that argumentation should be taught once knowledge of the discipline is acquired. Although professors report to promote argumentative practices in their teachings, they do not do it to develop argumentative skills. Learning evaluations implies knowing how to argue, but no assessment argumentation guidelines are provided. It is concluded that surveyed philosophy and law professors do not differ radically in their beliefs about the value of argumentation in professional practice. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Entrepreneurship is recognized by the European Union as one of the eight key competences for lifelong learning. Research on entrepreneurship started in the field of economics, although in recent decades the individual skills and attitudes it involves have become more important and there has been more interest in teaching and learning about the subject. Although some research has found a positive relationship between Entrepreneurship Education (EE) and entrepreneurial behavior, the relationship is not clear and the results are contradictory. The level of entrepreneurial initiative shown prior to any EE seems to be the variable that best explains the different results. Objective: The aim of this paper is to determine which individual differences can best identify those university students with a strong entrepreneurial attitude. Method: The sample was made up of 514 students from six Spanish universities, who were divided into two groups corresponding to individuals with high and low entrepreneurial intention. A step-by-step logistic regression analysis was performed resulting in a model in which the variables of emotional repair, low neuroticism and agreeableness were significant. Results: This model allows us to correctly forecast 62.20% of cases. Discussion: These findings are important for work on models that allow us to identify the profiles of potential entrepreneurs. The results are interesting in terms of the relationship between entrepreneurial education and intention and the investigation of whether an entrepreneurial intention profile, such as the one found in this research, could improve EE results and facilitate the transition from intention to action in entrepreneurial behavior. © 2021, Ministry Education and Science.

AB  - The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive overview of the publications focused on integrating education for sustainable development (ESD) competencies into teacher education during the last decade, in an endeavour to identify which competencies have been considered in the literature as key competencies for reorienting teacher education towards sustainability as well as explore the suggested assessment tools and approaches to integrate these competencies into teacher education programmes. The results show increased attention during the last decade to develop a set of ESD competencies for teachers, which reveals the absence of a unified framework for teacher competencies for ESD. However, the extent to which these competencies are effectively integrated into teacher education remains an undiscovered area. This paper highlights the progress and gaps in the research related to mainstreaming ESD competencies in teacher education, providing evidence from the literature that can inform policy and strategy improvement in higher education institutions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - National attention has been given to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, which is well recognized as an effective way to cultivate the key competencies of 21st-century talents. However, current STEM education falls short of the desired results. The fundamental reason is that there has not been a clearly and structurally explained systematic construction and effective implementation of STEM curricula. Accordingly, this article systematically expounds on the construction of the STEM curricula system from four aspects. Specifically, we first proposed the components of the STEM competencies as the goal of STEM education to provide a guiding direction for other parts of the design of the STEM curricula. Then, we elaborated on how to cultivate the STEM competencies from two aspects: the design principles of the STEM curricula content and the implementation strategies of STEM teaching. Finally, we explained how to effectively evaluate to monitor and improve the implementation of the STEM curriculum. In addition to the above mentioned, we then presented a case study of STEM courses constructed under the guidance of “think-based instruction theory” (TBIT) to help readers further understand the nature of the STEM curricula.

A total of 246 last-semester students from a School of Dentistry in southern Brazil, between the years of 2013 and 2016, answered an anonymous online questionnaire with open- and closed-ended questions (5-point Likert scale). Two thematic axes were analysed: structural and pedagogical evaluation of the internship experience and development of professional competences (theory of Ergology). The SPSS program (16.0) was used to obtain means and standard deviations for a descriptive analysis of the data. Content analysis was performed for the qualitative data. Results: The scores ranged from neutral to positive concerning pedagogical dynamics (mean scores between 3.08 and 3.82). The preceptors were evaluated with the best mean score (3.82). All the components used to assess professional competences obtained positive scores with the exception of teamwork (2.95). Adaptations to the clinical protocols learned in class were made by 44% of the students. Conclusions: The data showed that undergraduate dental students in the Service-Learning programme acquire competencies for clinical decision-making under unusual reality conditions. Adaptation of protocols was not related to less or greater knowledge of the protocols, which would be a negative condition, but to the students’ ability to formulate connections between scientific knowledge and the clinical practice. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - There has been a lot of interest to competence-based education in research and scholarship. How competence-based education has been developed and implemented varies across education systems in Europe. The European Commission defines digital competence as one of the eight key competence standards for lifelong learning. The European digital competence framework DigComp provides a comprehensive and exhaustive framework for citizens; it has the potential to be adapted to the needs of specific target groups. Nevertheless, no current research has focused on the need for developing a common framework for primary and secondary education. To address this gap we present a digital competence framework for European primary and secondary students. DigComp and a set of European frameworks are analysed in this paper. Combining categorical analysis with the collaboration of teachers and experts in the field, we define performance criteria and components that contribute to competence by five categories, providing a framework to promote the acquisition and evaluation of digital competence. This framework can be implemented in any EU country, it incorporates the most recent theoretical advances in research on information and communication technologies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The paper provides insights on the contemporary relevance of Talcott Parsons’s writings by analyzing 20 textbooks from Austria, Germany, Great Britain and the United States, published in 1999–2019. Whether having knowledge of Parsons is helpful to today’s students and other interested readers, and what knowledge, deserves consideration. Therefore , the paper asks: Which future gains of readers did textbook authors envision when they chose, in their own present, to discuss (or not) sociological writings from long ago? In order to understand what future opportunities authors wanted to create for readers, as well as how they chose to discuss Parsons to this end, the paper draws on Niklas Luhmann’s notion of memory. The analysis reveals several key competencies that student and other interested readers might acquire through having knowledge of Parsons’ writings and its critiques. These potentials would have gone unnoticed if authors had assessed Parsons’s relevance only according to whether he adequately considered conflict or not, as has been done in many debates about his work until today. Moreover, through analyzing how authors remembered Parsons, I distilled two key selective criteria: First, what must be remembered in order to enable readers to acquire those competencies? Second, which memories would be impeding for readers and thus be better left out? These criteria are relevant for research, as well. Looking at the future, it would be desirable that sociologists let Parsons assist them in their research in many different ways, if possible. As a result, we might see a revival of Parsons that enables genuine advancement. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to booming popularity of distance education, raising the question of ensuring critical thinking in students as one of the key competences. The present study aims to investigate how learning a Chinese language remotely affects the development of critical thinking in international students. The study took place in the Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, and involved comparing the levels of critical thinking in 233 international students learning Chinese remotely and 214 international students engaged in other areas and learning in their native language while training critical thinking, also remotely. The critical thinking assessment was carried out twice, at the beginning and at the end of the study, using the validated HEIghten® Critical Thinking Assessment suite in the native language of the respondents. The results of the study show that learning a Chinese language can facilitate the development of critical thinking in international students and that the low level of critical thinking among Chinese speakers is a myth. Future studies should focus more on exploring the psychophysiological predictors of critical thinking and developing valid psychodiagnostic techniques with regard to racial and ethnic characteristics of the psychophysiological mechanisms of cognition. In addition, the learning programs and training curricula aimed at critical thinking development must take into account the psychophysiology of learning. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Choral conducting is a complex and multi-faceted leader role. Leading music is a particular kind of leadership through the prominence of gestural communication, and it is a ubiquitous phenomenon across a variety of social settings, musical genres, and ensemble types. Despite the variety, colloquial writing as well as academic research implicitly assumes that there is a common underlying competence base. Most research on conducting looks at a particular aspect, such as gestures, error correction, or rehearsing approach. What is largely wanting, is an overall view of how the competence elements come together and their relative importance. This article is an exploratory study of 17 competence elements, viewed by conductors in the context of their own practice. The study is based on a survey of 294 choral conductors across Norway, with a wide spread in terms of formal education, experience and working situation. The study supports previous research by how the role of conducting gesture takes a seemingly contradictory position; emblematic of the role, but still scores low in terms of importance. Our analysis shows that the views on key competence elements, such as gestural skills, vary with contextual factors, whereas other elements, such as error detection and rehearsal organisation, do not. The two contextual factors that explain most variation for several competence elements are the length of the conductor’s experience and the level (amateur/professional) of the conductor’s choirs. Conductors’ views on the importance of each competence element are closely related to their own competence level for the same element. This suggests that the prominence that competence elements are given in conducting practice is highly adaptable, as conductors cope with the situation at hand. Although an academic degree in conducting has an impact on how conductors view the various competence elements, practice and experience seem to rule over education. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Purpose: The twenty-first century education system seeks to meet the societal demands of economic effectiveness and the unique professional development needs of individuals. This paper aims to discuss the qualities of competence-oriented educational processes and the recent movement towards competence-based curricula in higher education. Design/methodology/approach: This study follows a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology to explore the concept of competence within the context of educational science. The subsequent thematic synthesis analyses the findings of reviewed publications regarding graduate attributes in competence-oriented higher education and their perspectives and working-life expectations on exit profiles. Findings: Interest in competence-oriented education, training and learning has grown in recent years, resulting in numerous theoretical and technical pedagogical applications in higher education. Nonetheless, ambiguous terminology presents a significant challenge, which is demonstrated by the inconsistent language of the study's results. Moreover, there is an obvious need for teachers' in-service training. The qualitative synthesis of this article will be useful for both educational and working life sectors to inform and promote different perspectives on competence-oriented educational processes. A clear articulation of competences is crucial for reforming higher education to meet students' interests and recognise their work-life needs. Originality/value: The concept of competence has been under-investigated in higher education research and practices. This study offers novel insights and practical implications for competence-oriented learning concerning the paradigmatic change across higher education. © 2021, Sanna Brauer.

AB  - Traditionally, cognitive skills in mathematics and language have been described as key indicators for success. However, the social, technological, and economic changes that have occurred in the 21st century have made critical thinking, creativity, communication, and collaboration, key competences to face the challenges of a rapidly changing world. In this study, we developed a Computational Thinking (CT) curriculum based on student-centred pedagogical strategies to enhance these four competences. This curriculum was designed under the socio-cultural vision of learning, in which individuals interact in communities to build significant knowledge. An embedded mixed-method approach was implemented to evaluate improvements in competence development both in quantitative and qualitative ways in a sample of 42 students. The results indicate an encouraging increase in skills related to the competences of interest thanks to the implementation of a student-centred pedagogical curriculum based on CT. Additionally, by designing the curriculum under socio-cultural ideas of education the results show that the students and the teacher were able to form a community to facilitate teaching and learning. © 2021 Eskisehir Osmangazi University.

AB  - Basic employability competences, also known as key competences, are essential in accessing, retaining and advancing in employment, and are especially relevant in promoting the employment of disadvantaged young people. This study describes the development of a copyleft psychoeducational instrument based on the model posited by Arnau et al. (2014) that Social Pedagogy professionals can use to evaluate the basic employability competences in adolescents and young people aged 12 to 18: The Situational Test of Basic Employability Competences Development (DCBE). A total of 29 problem situations were designed and included within five stories related to the daily life of any adolescent. A total of 102 adolescents and young people were interviewed and asked how they would react to these problem situations. The responses were subjected to a content analysis in order to select the most frequent responses indicative of different levels of competence development. Ten experts then assigned the problem situations to one of the eight competences proposed by Arnau et al. (2014), before assigning scores of 0 to 5 to the different responses based on the level of development indicated by the responses, with high levels of agreement. Following a pilot study on a group of 47 young people to verify the variability of the responses, the test was administered to 1,011 young people at six training centres. A factor analysis of the responses yielded a unifactorial structure of 23 items, with high values for model fit and reliability. The results obtained support the content, ecological and construct validity of the DCBE test, which was well accepted by both students and teachers for its attractiveness and usefulness. The test makes it possible to begin preparing students for employment in the early stages prior to post-compulsory training. Its copyleft nature means it can be widely used by Social Pedagogy professionals. © 2015 SIPS. Licencia Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial (by-nc) Spain 3.0

AB  - The COVID-19 school closures highlighted the importance of crisis management for school and district leaders. Crisis management, however, has not received sufficient attention from school leadership preparation programs or education leadership researchers. This article synthesizes research spanning schools and other organizations, including those in the private sector, to describe a framework for understanding crises and crisis management in schools and districts and the key competences this literature suggests for successful navigation of crisis situations. We use this framework to discuss leaders’ responses to the COVID-19 school closures in spring 2020. We conclude with an argument for more consciously incorporating crisis management training into both preservice and in-service preparation and support for education leaders and for opening new lines of inquiry into crisis leadership at the school and district levels. © 2021 AERA.

AB  - The study of revision has been a topic of interest in writing research over the past decades. Numerous studies have, for instance, shown that learning-to-revise is one of the key competences in writing development. Moreover, several models of revision have been developed, and a variety of taxonomies have been used to measure revision in empirical studies. Current advances in data collection and analysis have made it possible to study revision in increasingly precise detail. The present study aimed to combine previous models and current advances by providing a comprehensive product- and process-oriented tagset of revision. The presented tagset includes properties of external revisions: trigger, orientation, evaluation, action, linguistic domain, spatial location, temporal location, duration, and sequencing. We identified how keystroke logging, screen replays, and eye tracking can be used to extract both manually and automatically extract features related to these properties. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how this tagset can be used to annotate revisions made by higher education students in various academic tasks. To conclude, we discuss how this tagset forms a scalable basis for studying revision in writing in depth. © 2021 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Called the competence of the 21st century, creativity is one of the key competencies for sustainable development. There is no fixed path to achieve sustainability and it is subject to human creativity. However, integrated development of both is surely an under-researched topic. Creative thinking and creative problem solving should be a necessary and significant component of modern sustainable education. Students must learn to associate creativity with sustainability. Helping them understand sustainability by exposing them to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and de-signing new creations that honor the planetary boundaries is crucial. The paper focuses on developing creativity by Polish teachers who work with adolescents. The assumption was that creativity can be developed using certain didactic methods and forms. The objective of the study was to ex-plore and to describe which didactic methods and forms teachers use to shape the competence of creativity in students. The teachers took part in a survey and were asked what methods and forms they use to develop creativity in their students. The sample consisted of 337 teachers from the Mało-polska region. The results of the analyses show that teachers use only a few of the methods recom-mended to facilitate creativity, which may lead to a low level of this competence among the stu-dents. They also use the most common didactic forms, which may not support the development of creativity competences. Moreover, the research results show that there are several factors, such as the teacher’s seniority and the location of the school, which determine the choice of individual teaching methods. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Competence-based education (CBE) is an international educational trend and a core issue in developing Finnish vocational upper secondary and higher education. The theory and practice of the competence-based approach should preferably be included in vocational teacher studies. Yet, there are still relatively few organisations implementing competence-based vocational teacher education in Finland. This article examines the realisation of competence-based vocational teacher education. The small-scale mixed-method case study explains the student teachers’ conceptions of the competence goals in their studies. The competence goals describe the competencies to be achieved as a result of training. According to the research findings, competence goals clarify the student teachers’ understanding of the demands of a teacher’s work, facilitate students to reflect on their competences and help in preparing individual study plans and promoting their studies. However, the student teachers need university teachers’ guidance to get their studies started and to promote the competences flexibly. © 2020 Association for Teacher Education in Europe.

AB  - This article aims to review literature on CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) theory and prac-tice, particularly during Science classes using English as a foreign language. In Europe, the CLIL approach – directed at the acquisition of both the additional “Language” and subject “Content” – has arisen to promote foreign language learning, but it could also be beneficial for the specific subject education. To support learners in understanding scientific information and taking responsible socio-scientific decisions, Science communication (its verbal language and other representation modes) should be emphasised over facts and formulas and addressed as a key competence. Studying CLIL programmes, which nurture language learning/use within Science education, becomes relevant. As a state of the art this work shows aspects of CLIL emergence and evolu-tion and research gaps, such as CLIL as an educational methodology to enhance Science teaching. This study contributes to research on CLIL Science and language-focused Science education towards scientific literacy. © 2021, University of Bologna. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the past 20 years, social work education has built a bridge between the classroom and field using client simulation to learn clinical skills. This paper outlines an innovative model of simulation that incorporates LS used to teach motivational interviewing (MI). In addition, guidelines with specific steps for teaching MI with simulation and LS are discussed. Unfortunately, most present day simulation models leave out methods to instruct and supervise students in real time. When implementing clinical simulations there is little opportunity to correct a trainee’s behavior or to practice a new skill at the perfect teachable moment during an interview. This instruction must wait until the interview is finished and the debriefing has begun. With the addition of LS, the simulation experience is enhanced for students as the supervisor is now incorporated as an active participant in the interview. Using LS, the instructor can now direct and even model appropriate clinical responses and interventions. The use of simulation with LS is innovative and builds on social work’s evolving body of simulation-based education and further strengthens this approach. Results of this model suggest that students quickly learn to appreciate the value added of LS to simulation and that clinical skills learned resist decay overtime. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Aim: Recent developments measured using statistics and surveys among veterinarians show that integrating key competence training into veterinary education is becoming increasingly important. This article describes the collaborative development process of the first work package within theSOFTVETS project. The SOFTVETS project aims to create a competence model and an ideal version of a soft skills curriculum that can be implemented in veterinary higher education throughout Europe. Method: In the course of a desk research phase, a literature review and an inventory of the current practice of key competence training within veterinary education was carried out. An initial set of recommendations for three competence areas was developed usingthe Handbook for Internal Quality Management in Competence-Based Higher Education. Finally, an alternating sequence of individual and collaborative expert reviews was carried out. Result: Experts from five European countries participated in the process. The derived competence model consisted of the following three competence areas with the corresponding number of defined competences: ten communication, nine entrepreneurial and eightdigital competences. Conclusion: In the next work packages, learning objectives, teaching and assessment methods will be collected. Training concepts for facilitators to provide professional competence training will be established. In addition, an evaluation toolkit will be developed to standardise the implementation, evaluation and assessment of competence training events. The SOFTVETS competence model should help educators to be able to integrate the training of key competence training into the veterinary curriculum. This detailed list of competences can also be used as a tool to identify existing deficiencies and thus enable further curricular changes. © 2021 Kleinsorgen et al.

AB  - Microbiology is an essential element of our everyday lives. This is not only the consequence of the importance of some pathogenic microorganisms, but also due to their positive and important role in processes related to human health, food production or waste recycling, to cite a few. However, the relevance of microbiology for the well-being of humankind and the planet still needs to reach beyond academic circles. Many current matters of urgency, such as environmental pollution or climate change, could partly be tackled by using green and sustainable solutions derived from microbial biotechnologies. Nevertheless, the wider public still attributes a negative connotation to microbes such as fungi and bacteria. The aim of this study was to implement service-learning as a pedagogical approach to increase scientific and microbiology literacy in society. Service-learning is a teaching and learning strategy that integrates community service and civic responsibility, fostering the dissemination of scientific knowledge. This approach is used to communicate about pressing societal issues surrounding microbes (antibiotic resistance, natural resources recycling, human microbiota, and food production among others) to an audience of pupils attending public schools. The activity of service-learning is proposed in the final year of the biology bachelor curriculum. Its purpose is to allow university students to develop and practice their lay communication skills as a key competence to be acquired during their university education. In the activity, the students developed their own concept and material for the activity and delivered it to pupils at primary and secondary school levels (pupils aged 6–15 years old). The message is also expected to be disseminated beyond the participants, when the students and pupils share their experience with family and friends. With this pedagogical approach, we intend to raise awareness regarding about the importance of microbiology and its dual roles as harmful and beneficial for humans. We also wish to increase the connection between primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions. Finally, we want to highlight the importance of having a new generation of communication savvy professionals in biology. © Copyright © 2021 Fatton, Schneiter, Allisiardi, Hänni, Hauser, Gonçalves-Fernandes, Pessina, Pijnenburg, Vaudroz, Bshary, Bindschedler and Junier.

AB  - In this study, we developed and validated an instrument for measuring postgraduate competence and examined the relationships between postgraduate competence and academic research performance, along with the mediating role of psychological capital. Based on two independent samples, the results provided robust evidence of postgraduate competence composed of six dimen-sions. Adopting a two-wave survey at two different time periods, we conducted a questionnaire survey on 364 postgraduates from three top universities in China by random sampling. The results indicated that postgraduate competence was positively associated with academic research performance. Among the competences composed of six dimensions, research ability was the most predictive dimension of academic research performance. Additionally, psychological capital partially mediated the relationship between postgraduate competence and academic research performance. These findings contributed to the ongoing discussion about improving postgraduates’ academic research performance under the circumstance of competence-based education. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: Nowadays, communication practitioners are well-equipped with all kinds of skills and competencies. Nevertheless, those capabilities seem not to prevent professionals from stress and burnout. Stress resilience, i.e. the ability to deal with high demands at work, to cope with and recover from stress, seems to be a missing competence. This study sheds light on this important, but barely discussed aspect of communication management. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach was applied to understand sources of stress and to identify opportunities to build stress resilience competence. Therefore, 40 in-depth interviews with senior leaders and young professionals in 30 agencies in the largest countries on two continents were conducted (United States vs Germany). Findings: This study revealed common and threat drivers of stress. Overall, the work environment can be summarised as highly demanding and multifaceted, where stress resilience might be a useful competence to have to be successful and to be protected against negative stress outcomes such as burnout. The study identifies several reasons why resilient professionals are more successful in coping with stress. It is further shown that most communication agencies in the sample have already implemented programmes to increase employees' resilience. Originality/value: This study offers an alternative view on the much-debated future of work by using an interdisciplinary approach and large-scale, qualitative insights from the agency environment. A novel concept is introduced that can stimulate further research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Cultivating students’ key competencies contributes to students’ adaptation to the fast developing intelligent era. Artificial intelligence education is an important way to cultivate students’ key competencies. It is increasingly important to set up appropriate artificial intelligence courses at the fundamental education stage and cultivate students’ key competencies via such courses. This paper describes quantitatively how AI courses cultivate students’ key competencies. First, we analyze the necessity of artificial intelligence education at the fundamental education stage and the status quo of artificial intelligence education in China. Next, we elaborate the students’ key competencies which is composed of knowledge competence, team competence and learning competence, and design the curriculum of artificial intelligence at the fundamental education stage. Finally, through collecting students’ questionnaires, we analyze the relationship between the curriculum of artificial intelligence and the cultivation of students’ key competencies. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the 7 categories of artificial intelligence courses are beneficial to the cultivation of the six key sub-competencies of students. In addition, the problems in the current artificial intelligence curriculum are identified and suggestions for improvement are put forward. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This article analyzes the writing competence of Norwegian students and apprentices in three professions: Healthcare, industrial mechanics and electricians. The research forms part of a large-scale assessment project in vocational education and training (VET). A subset of 108 written test-answers were subjected to an explorative analysis focusing on generic and professional writing competencies. A more text-based and trans-contextual working life for many professions requires not only profession-specific communicative competency, but also a stronger engagement in generic literacy practices. The need for written communication with customers, clients and colleagues across workplaces and countries has increased and the use of understandable language when communicating with non-peers is required. In the study, we found that the generic writing competency declined during apprenticeship, but on the other hand that the use of professional-specific terminology increased. We also found that writing competence seemed to be contextualized according to different traditions, text cultures and discourses across the three professions. The article questions the prevalence of text-based examinations in VET and analytical categories for measuring writing competence that do not take into account a multimodal character of professional communication. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The objective of the study is to describe our matrix-based guidelines in revising our competence-based curriculum. A curriculum restructure relies on pragmatic and iterative refinement of the situations integrating various stakeholders' perspectives as well as field-based research by considering currently critical and emerging trends, such as the inclusion of the 21st century skills. The revision project took a 150-day duration and implemented the subsequent stages: 0). Build a common language 1). Identify aspects that are working well at the moment and those that may need revision in the current curriculum, 2). Align the performance indicators using the evaluation matrix, 3). Select types of learning activities that correlate with Bloom's taxonomy verbs, 4). Incorporate student learning autonomy into the curriculum. The matrix was used to facilitate equal, organized, and clearer distribution, thus, bringing the coherence of indicators for the 5-year progressive learning courses. The contribution of the study is to achieve comprehensive, systematic, and continuous improvement of the competence-based educational model for Latin American universities within engineering study programs. © 2022 Kassel University Press GmbH.

AB  - In this study, three dimensions were evaluated: the process of developing the curriculum, course distribution to serve quality assurance, and development of courses for Merdeka Belajar (Freedom to Learn) program. Curriculum documents and papers presented in the focus group discussion were used as data sources. Content analysis design and qualitative data analysis were used for analyzing the data. A total of 42 participants from Indonesian public and Islamic universities were included in this study. The data were thematically analyzed. The study resulted in three key findings. First, initial curriculum development focused on competency-based curriculum and outcome-based education. Not all learning outcomes and course mapping match the curriculum based on backward design. Second, the National Qualification Framework should be built on the skill and knowledge cluster to adequately assess course learning outcomes. Also, the 144-credit-course distribution should allow the undergraduate program to be completed in seven semesters. Third, curriculum developers can divide 40 semester credits for Merdeka Belajar courses and 104 credits for regular courses. Conversion of credits can be achieved by assigning equal courses in the same semester, combining undergraduate research with fieldwork, or publication in a journal. © 2022, Association for Social Studies Educa.

AB  - Advancing transformations towards sustainability calls for change agents equipped with a new set of competencies. Such sustainability competencies have been articulated with multiplicity and ambiguity, which is counterproductive to joint and accelerated progress. A unified framework of sustainability learning objectives would provide guidance to students, educators, and administrators of sustainability programs. To this end, we carried out a systematic review of the relevant literature. After scanning thousands of publications, we identified over 270 peer-reviewed articles of highest relevance, spanning two decades. Despite appearance otherwise, we found that there is a high level of agreement among scholars over the sustainability competencies that students should be trained in. Expanding on the five key competencies, namely, systems-thinking, anticipatory, normative, strategic, and interpersonal competence, that have gained widespread use, this article synthesizes the new suggestions made over the past decade into a unified framework. It centers on 8 key competencies in sustainability (the 5 established and 3 emerging—intrapersonal, implementation, and integration competence), which are complemented by separate disciplinary, general, and other professional competencies. This comprehensive framework of key competencies in sustainability is applicable across disciplines and can guide faculty, students, and practitioners in their joint efforts to advance transformations towards sustainability.

AB  - This article attempts to bring together the most important educational priorities which should be taken into consideration when planning education in a world recover-ing from a pandemic. Some of the priorities discussed here should have already been taken into account during the 20th century, whilst others are completely new and result from changes that have come about in the 21st century, such as increased arrogance, ignorance, authoritarianism, educational insecurity, contempt for nature, confusion and the promotion of the lies under the name of post-truth. The authors propose a holistic approach to the education process, focused on pri-orities. In turn, the definition of those priorities should result from the most important problems that affect humanity. © 2021, Pro Scientia Publica Foundation. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study contributes to the current research in career and professional identity development in that it developed a validated competency-based framework to enhance professional and self-awareness of future engineers. Through a mixed-method design, key competencies were identified for three professional roles for early career engineers. Ninety-six engineers and HR experts from different fields were involved. This resulted in three portraits of early career engineers in practice (engineers in a role focusing on radical innovation, on process optimisation and/or on customised solutions) and what it requires to be successful in these roles. For example, perseverance and creativity were deemed essential for engineers in an innovative role, whereas positive critical attitude and stress resistance were indicated essential for engineers focusing on optimisation. The competency profiles with an aspiration to career perspectives can be a valuable instrument in creating more diversity in engineering. Implications for education, industry, and future research are discussed. © 2021 SEFI.

AB  - Background: This study investigates teacher collaboration in Hungarian vocational education and training (VET) schools based on an online survey of teachers (n = 303). Collaboration of teachers has long been appreciated for its significant benefits including increased motivation, job satisfaction, self- and collective efficacy, as well as its role in teacher professional development and school improvement. Collaboration of teachers working in VET schools, especially in VET systems where initial VET is provided to young people and (in part) within compulsory education, appears as particularly desirable, given the special context, objectives and challenges of this sector and the spread of competence-based education. However, relatively little is known about VET teacher collaboration, especially in Hungary, where three different profiles of teachers—general subject and vocational teachers and vocational trainers—work in VET schools. The aim of our study was to provide data about how Hungarian VET teachers collaborate, which could validate prior research results on teacher collaboration as well as identify any special features of the VET context. Method: Our study design was exploratory, descriptive and correlational, applying quantitative statistical analysis. We measured teacher collaboration (practice and perception of impact) and explanatory individual and organisational factors selected for our research framework by adapting instruments of previous empirical studies (most importantly, OECD’s TALIS). We analysed connections between collaboration and independent variables created by principal component analysis. Results: Our data show that sharing-type collaboration (professional discussions and exchange of materials) are widespread among Hungarian VET teachers. They are much less likely to participate in deeper collaborative activities that presuppose higher levels of interdependence, and they also appreciate the impact of deeper collaboration less. Female respondents participate in sharing-type activities more than their male colleagues, and middle-aged (40–55) are most active in both types of collaboration and perceive the most impact. Collaboration practices correlate most with perceptions of their impact. More frequent collaboration and perceptions of higher impact are related to teachers’ sense of higher self-efficacy and relaxed, tolerant and encouraging collegial relationships. Structural barriers seem to influence only sharing and perceptions of impact. Small, but statistically significant differences in collaboration were found between the three teacher profiles. Vocational trainers (who instruct vocational school practice) showed the highest level of participation in deeper collaboration, while vocational teachers were least likely to participate and perceived the least impact. No significant associations were found between collaboration and prior or current work experience in the taught vocation. Conclusions: Our results largely confirm and validate previous research on teacher collaboration in lower level and general educational contexts by providing data on VET teacher collaboration. They also note the role of some VET-specific factors, such as structural barriers and small, but statistically significant differences between different VET teacher profiles. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - In many societies across the globe, females are still underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM fields), although they are reported to have higher grades in high school and college than males. The present study was guided by the assumption that the sustainability of higher education critically rests on the academic success of both male and female students under conditions of equitable educational options, practices, and contents. It first assessed the persistence of familiar patterns of gender bias (e.g., do competencies at enrollment, serving as academic precursors, and academic performance favor females?) in college students of a society in transition from a gender-segregated workforce with marked gender inequalities to one whose aims at integrating into the global economy demand that women pursue once forbidden careers thought to be the exclusive domain of men. It then examined how simple indices of academic readiness, as well as preferences for fields fitting traditional gender roles, could predict attainment of key competencies and motivation to graduate (as measured by the average number of credits completed per year) in college. As expected, females had a higher high school GPA. Once in college, they were underrepresented in a major that fitted traditional gender roles (interior design) and over-represented in one that did not fit (business). Female students’ performance and motivation to graduate did not differ between the male-suited major of business and the female-suited major of interior design. Male students’ performance and motivation to graduate were higher in engineering than in business, albeit both majors were gender-role consistent. Although high school GPA and English proficiency scores predicted performance and motivation for all, preference for engineering over business also predicted males’ performance and motivation. These findings offered a more complex picture of patterns of gender bias, thereby inspiring the implementation of targeted educational interventions to improve females’ motivation for and enrollment in STEM fields, nowadays increasingly available to them, as well as to enhance males’ academic success in non-STEM fields such as business. © 2021 by the author.

AB  - Heritage education is understood to be multifaceted. The way it is approached and conceived in formal educational contexts can differ according to the emphasis policy makers wish to establish. In Flanders, a region within Belgium, a curriculum reform took shape over the last seven years. This paper explores the recently introduced curriculum in Flemish secondary education, in light of Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. The main aim is to investigate how heritage education and sustainability fit into the newly developed curriculum framework, and the way they are interlinked on a conceptual level. The qualitative research draws on a screening of policy texts, learning outcomes, and additional interviews with policy advisors. The results show that heritage education is implicitly present. Cross-curricular opportunities are built-in and can be linked to (a) cultural awareness and expression; (b) historical consciousness; (c) citizenship; and (d) intercultural communication. Sustainable development, and more specific ESD, anchored itself firmly and more explicitly into the framework as a transversal key competence as well. However, clear connections to heritage education are not set up in the learning outcomes. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An Indian medical graduate needs to be competent in the diagnosis and management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. This is crucial in terms of occupational safety. A participatory learning approach could be a possible way to change behavior and improve HIV risk assessment skills among medical students for better occupational safety and health care. The present study was planned to identify the need, provide different learning experiences for acquiring competency, and compare the effectiveness of participatory learning over traditional in developing HIV risk assessment skills. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An educational interventional (randomized controlled trial) was carried out at GEMS and Hospital. Needs assessment survey was conducted, which identified HIV risk assessment as a key competency. For which the outcome-specific learning objectives were defined, two different learning experiences were employed. A pretest was conducted to assess the baseline knowledge and attitude (n = 92); they were then divided into two equal groups (A and B). 'A' group was taught by participatory approach, whereas 'B' by traditional techniques followed by posttest and objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) to assess their HIV risk assessment skills. Statistical analysis: Paired t-test for assessing knowledge and attitude within the same group and unpaired t-test for assessing skills between the two groups were used in this study. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvement (P < 0.001) in knowledge and attitude scores was noticed that OSCE scores were significantly higher in the intervention group 'A' (P < 0.001) as compared to 'B' taught by traditional techniques. CONCLUSION: Participatory learning effectively builds upon existing knowledge and attitude to develop better HIV risk assessment skills. © 2021 Journal of Research in Medical Sciences Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - Background/purpose - In terms of computational thinking core facets, algorithmic thinking is a key competency applicable not only in Computer Science but also in aspects of daily life. Considering the global phenomenon of gender stereotypes with regards to the academic and professional orientation in STEM fields, we focused on investigating the level of students' algorithmic thinking skills by gender in early childhood. This article provides evidence of research implemented under the umbrella of quantitative methodology, employing an innovative assessment tool constructed to meet the requirements of the study. The findings obtained could facilitate researchers and policymakers to support equity in learning opportunities, starting from the first stage of compulsory education. Materials/methods - The study aligns to the principles of quantitative research methodology. Its backbone is a digital platform of multidisciplinary, play-based, and constructivist character, which we implemented from scratch in order to satisfy the requirements of our research. Results - The findings of the study revealed that algorithmic thinking skills are not related to students' gender in early childhood. Conclusion - The findings of the study bring out that, at very young ages, the effect of gender stereotypes is not observable as far as students' algorithmic thinking skills are concerned. The implications of the study highlight the need to focus on the schooling stages that follow early childhood in order to tackle the gender gap in STEM fields. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Credentialing assessment for overseas-educated optometrists seeking registration in Australia and New Zealand is administered by the Optometry Council of Australia and New Zealand. The aim was to review the validation and outcomes of the written components of this exam to demonstrate credentialing meets entry-level competency standards. Methods: The Competency in Optometry Examination consists of two written and two clinical parts. Part 1 of the written exam comprises multiple choice questions (MCQ) covering basic and clinical science, while Part 2 has 18 short answer questions (SAQ) examining diagnosis and management. Candidates must pass both written components to progress to the clinical exam. Validity was evaluated using Kane’s framework for scoring (marking criteria, item analysis), generalization (blueprint), extrapolation (standard setting), and implications (outcome, including pass rates). A competency-based blueprint, the Optometry Australia Entry-level Competency Standards for Optometry 2014, guided question selection with the number of items weighted towards key competencies. A standard setting exercise, last conducted in 2017, was used to determine the minimum standard for both written exams. Item response theory (Rasch) was used to analyse exams, produce reliability metrics, apply consistent standards to the results, calibrate difficulty across exams, and score candidates. Results: Data is reported on 12 administrations of the written examination since 2014. Of the 193 candidates who sat the exam over the study period, 133 (68.9%) passed and moved on to the practical component. Ninety-one (47.2%) passed both the MCQ and SAQ exams on their first attempt. The MCQ exam has displayed consistently high reliability (reliability index range 0.71 to 0.93, average 0.88) across all 12 administrations. Prior to September 2017 the SAQ had a set cutscore of 50%, and the difficulty of the exam was variable. Since the introduction of Rasch analysis to calibrate difficulty across exams, the reliability and power of the SAQ exam has been consistently high (separation index range 0.82 to 0.93, average 0.86). Conclusions: The findings from collective evidence support the validity of the written components (MCQ and SAQ) of the credentialing of the competency of overseas-educated optometrists in Australia and New Zealand. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Translation ethics today is an area of growing concern, so is its education. In the new millennium, ethics has become an explicit and integrative component of translator education. Meanwhile, the objective of translation ethics education has shifted from preaching abstract, universalistic translator codes of ethics to training translation students’ ethical sensitivity and reflexive moral judgement (i.e., ethical decision-making). This study advances translation ethics education pivoted around students’ translational ethical decision-making competence (TEDC) by first providing a definition and a competence framework for TEDC and then sketching a competence-based education programme targeting translation students’ TEDC. In completing the tasks, this article draws theories and practices from cognitive psychology, where ethical decision-making has been studied extensively. On the one hand, it borrows the Neurocognitive Model of Ethical Decision-making to theorise the dual components of TEDC, i.e., competences of intuitive and rational ethical decision-making. On the other hand, it synthesises the relevant literature on intuition education and rationalist moral education to design a tentative TEDC-targeted translation ethics education programme. It argues that the proposed programme could be put to test in practice, and ethical decision-making holds the potential to become a productive entry point into translator ethics education. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Aim. The article provides a new solution to the problem of the formation of sustainable development competencies in primary school students. The objective of the article is to substantiate the method of forming sustainable development competencies in primary school students and to reflect it in the model. Methods. The main research methods are observation, test, interview, question-naire, analysis of media works, expert evaluation, and pedagogical experiment. A set of diagnostic tools has been specified. Results and conclusions. The efficiency of the developed technique has been proved with the results obtained from the experiment: the partnership of teachers, students and parents contributes to sustainability competencies formation; implementa-tion of common areas of media education and education for sustainable development evidenced to feasibility of the research, namely: education in legal, economic aspects, creation of media products with a projection to sustainable development, learning critical perception of mass media information, sustainability goals orientation. Due to the introduction of the experimental methodology, the number of students with high (12.07%) and satisfactory (14.65%) levels of the key competencies in the field of sustainable development increased against the background of a decrease in the number of respondents with sufficient (12.93%) and low (13.79%) levels. Originality. Emphasis is placed on the features of the designed methodology: appli-cation of partnership pedagogy and pedagogy of empowerment, integration of education for sustainable development with media education, compliance with a number of pedagogical conditions, forms and methods. © 2021, Pro Scientia Publica Foundation.

AB  - Sustainable development is growingly being developed in universities around the world. The United Nations presented eight Sustainability Key Competencies (SKCs) that represent cross-cutting competencies crucial to advance sustainable development and achieve Sustainable Development Goals. The aim of this research is to know to what extent the University of Iceland courses seem to include the emphasis of the SKCs, either in the course description text or the learning outcomes. Data collection took place in early 2020 and included analysing every single university’s course description text and learning outcomes using a curriculum analysis key for SKCs. Results show that proportionally, most signs of SKCs were found for SKC 3 (Normative competency) in 53% of courses in the university, and SKC 6 (Critical thinking competency) in 46% of the university’s courses. For individual schools of the university, the far highest proportion of signs of SKC was found for the School of Education (5.0 signs per course) and the relatively fewest for the School of Humanities (1.1 sign per course). The results are discussed both in relation to identified competencies needed for the pressing sustainability problems humanity faces, and in the light of a discrepancy appearing between the university’s ranking according to Times Higher Education University Ranking by cita-tions, research, and teaching, and the proportional signs of individual SKCs within the University of Iceland. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Entrepreneurship competence is one of the eight key competences for promoting lifelong learning, employability, and ensuring success in the knowledge society. The main objective of this study is to analyse to what extent entrepreneurship competence, as contemplated in the main European reference frameworks (EntreComp and EntreCompEdu), is incorporated into the competences that make up pre-service teachers training degrees offered by Spanish Jesuit universities. A content analysis of 631 competences was carried out by means of an expert judgement. The results of the study allow us to conclude, among others, that: with the exception of Assessment (EntreCompEdu), the remaining areas of both frameworks are covered by 30% of the competences proposed by the universities; none of the universities incorporate the competences Motivation and perseverance, Financial and economic literacy and Coping with uncertainty, ambiguity and risk of EntreComp, nor Checking and reporting on progress, Share feedback and Recognising progress and achievement of EntreCompEdu; the EntreComp competences Mobilising others, Planning and managing, and Working with others, and the EntreCompEdu Creating an empowering entrepreneurial learning environment are recognised the most; it is in the specific and general competences of the University of Deusto and Ramon LLull University that the above-mentioned competences are most frequently recognised. In conclusion, although there is still much to be done, entrepreneurship competence is included in initial teacher training at Jesuit universities in Spain. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - While the vast majority of training, education, and leader development experiences for military officers are related to operations overseas, civil support operations are conducted in a radically different environment. This article reports on an exploratory study on how senior military leaders perceive leadership during a crisis-disaster response in the U.S. Homeland, and the developmental experiences and activities they believe support effective leadership during highly complex civil support operations. Using a qualitative, grounded theory approach, I collected data through semi-structured interviews of senior National Guard officers who had led complex crisis-disaster response operations. This study resulted in proposed theoretical models identifying key competencies for senior military leadership in domestic operations, along with essential contributors to effectiveness. These models can assist in the development of senior military officers for leadership in civil-support operations and may be applicable to leadership in civilian response organizations, resulting in more effective disaster responses.

AB  - Many researchers and institutions in the field of education are striving to align the different levels of the education system to the growing needs and requirements of society. A meaningful part of these attempts has been concentrated on a systematic introduction of the competence-based education approach. Some countries adopted it and reshaped the school systems accordingly. Introduced in Italian secondary schools in 2010 by the Ministry for Education, the competence-based approach has been only partially adopted in classes. Our research aims at investigating solutions to support its adoption for teachers in Italian secondary schools. As student projects are frequently proposed in computer science classes, the project-based learning method was identified as a potential solution and investigated in an empirical study including two parts: (a) An action research training course on project-based learning; (b) A collective case-study involving six student projects. The empirical study highlighted some critical issues to be dealt with to foster the adoption of the competence-based teaching approach. Results confirmed a weak commitment of teachers to the competence-based approach, but also that exploiting student projects towards the project-based learning method may encourage teachers to adopt a competence-based approach, provided the projects are carefully designed and subsequently managed. To this end the paper offers a schema to check if a project is compliant with the project-based learning approach and some guidelines to support teachers in their activity during the student projects. © Italian e-Learning Association.

AB  - The importance of developing intercultural competence as one of the key competences in today’s rapidly changing and multicultural society has been spoken of often. The requirement of preparing interculturally competent communicators has therefore become one of the goals of today’s foreign language education. The aim of the present paper is to shed light on the practice of fostering intercultural skills in teaching English as a foreign language at Slovak secondary schools. The findings of the research, including observations of lessons, interviews with teachers, as well as analysis of teaching materials, reveals that the development of intercultural competence is still not integrated into foreign language education in Slovakia. © 2021, Immigrant Institutet.

AB  - This article outlines a secondary analysis of two European studies on innovative teacher professional development, through the lens of the Personal, Social and Learning to Learn European key competence. The 2018 European Recommendation describes it as being resilient, reflecting upon oneself, working with others, and managing time, information, learning and career. Adaptive, socio-emotional and metacognitive competences can be essential to harness other competences and navigate an unpredictable world, as argued in the LifeComp European framework. To nurture this key competence, teachers have to develop it themselves throughout the career. Innovative professional development can be a catalyst, addressing the complex and situated nature of teacher learning. It entails re-thinking time, space and mode of delivery, embedding active learning, relevance to practice, collaboration, coaching, feedback, and reflection. Innovative examples are presented as reciprocally related to Personal, Social and Learning to Learn, for resilient education systems in the wake of the COVID 19 pandemic. © 2021 Association for Teacher Education in Europe.

AB  - We investigate students' misconceptions in electrostatics, direct current (DC) and magnetism which are important in electricity and magnetism. We developed and administered a multiple-choice questionnaire test to reveal students' misconceptions related to charged bodies, lightning, electric fields, electric potential, forces, DC resistive electric circuits and magnets. This test aimed at obtaining quantitative information about misconceptions and was administered to 380 senior two students from Nine Year Basic Education (9YBE) Schools. The selected students have some experience with the new Rwandan secondary physics Competence Based Curriculum (CBC) that is currently under implementation. We find that senior two students have several common misconceptions related to these concepts. The data indicate that although students have some backgrounds on the subject matter, they still seem to believe that if the two charges are separated by a distance, a large-charged object exerts a greater force of attraction or repulsion on the small one. Considerable number of participated students held the misconception of considering current consumption in the resistor/bulb or the electrical devices in the circuits. They also believed that the battery was a continuous current source. The findings also revealed that students held a misconception that a bar magnet when broken into pieces, it is demagnetized. Moreover, a considerable number of participants hold the misconception that all metals are attracted by a magnet. Our study also revealed some of the statistically significant differences in terms of either gender or location of schools for some items.  © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The relationship between science and society has, for many years, been the subject of debate in different fields, and various proposals have been made regarding the kind of science education that citizens require. The present study considers an understanding of the nature of science (NOS) to be one of the key competences that citizens should acquire as part of their science education. Hence, our aim was to identify NOS aspects among the key scientific competences for citizenship identified by a panel of Spanish experts. The analysis is based on a review of the recent literature on the NOS, and especially on the results of a previous Delphi study in which 31 experts were asked to propose key aspects of scientific competence for citizenship. The present study involved three stages: identification of NOS themes in the experts’ initial proposals, analysis of how their importance ratings of these themes changed over the course of the Delphi rounds, and analysis of variability among the experts according to their professional group. We identified 12 NOS themes that, in line with recent publications in this field, included those related to the practice of science. A stable consensus was only observed for one theme: critical attitude. These results provide further evidence of the well-documented difficulty of defining and selecting NOS themes. However, the analysis also suggests that critical attitude is one of the key themes that should form part of science education for citizens. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Introduction: The ever-progressing transformation of the media as a result of digitization trends, the new characteristics of the communication environment and the associated communication practices and forms of user behaviour result in new educational needs and demands. Their reassessment in the context of current scientific discourses takes the form of revision and redefinition of the concept of media competence. Methodology: through a reflexive analysis of the concepts and models, we present the conceptualization of media competence as an extended competence to the area of personal, social, cultural and civic competencies. Results: The result of the work is a reassessment of conceptual positions in the projection of features of media competence in the context of the significant phenomena of the converged digital environment: participatory paradigm, hyperconnectivity, proliferation of disinformation. This approach requires the extension of skills and abilities in accessing, evaluating, analyzing, creating and communicating news and media; skills combining the previous forms of literacy and skills of digital environment (Livingstone, 2004; Pérez Tornero, Celot, Varis, 2007; Hobbs, 2008). Discussion: Our approach is associated with broader educational demands and needs aimed at the development of the individual’s personality in a more holistic way, connected with the more complex needs of a society where media presence is higher. Conclusions: The changes in the subject of Learning about the media are resassed at the end of the paper. © 2022, University of La Laguna. All rights reserved.

AB  - In a recent study, we identified seven key circular competencies for design: (1) Design for Multiple Use Cycles, (2) Design for Recovery, (3) Circular Impact Assessment, (4) Circular Business Models, (5) Circular User Engagement, (6) Circular Economy Collaboration, and (7) Circular Economy Communication. These were derived from small‐scale studies with designers working in the Netherlands. We set out to assess to what extent this set of seven competencies is recognized by an international group of designers and to evaluate whether any competencies are missing. We used an online survey to collect data from 128 respondents from 25 countries working on circular economy projects. The survey results showed that respondents use and have expertise in all seven competencies and they stressed the practical importance of two new competencies: Circular Systems Thinking and Circular Materials and Manufacturing. The resulting set of nine key competencies is the first internationally verified, coherent set of key circular economy competencies for design. This set will strengthen the pedagogical base of design for a circular economy and will guide the development of circular design methodology. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Modern technology has already changed the way we live, but the COVID-19 pandemic has provided us educators with an unprecedented situation in which we are faced with the enormous challenge of teaching online for a long period of time. It is therefore important to analyse various techniques for getting the most out of distance teaching, especially in a synchronous mode. The aim of the study discussed in this article was to analyse students' attitudes towards collaborative online work undertaken in synchronous mode during the pandemic. Thirty-three first-year BA students studying English Philology participated in this study. Respondents reflected on the process of online, synchronous collaboration via MS Teams by answering an online survey. The results of the study revealed that collaborative learning allows participants to actively participate in an online lesson, interact with others, co-construct a writing task, apply the new language introduced in lessons in a practical task and receive almost instant feedback. Consequently, any sense of isolation the students may feel is reduced and a sense of community is developed. In addition to this, a collaborative task enhances students' use of academic skills and the development of key competences that can lay the foundation for lifelong learning. © This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License ( ) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

AB  - Project-based sustainability courses require and facilitate diverse interactions among stu-dents, instructors, stakeholders, and mentors. Most project-based courses take an instrumental approach to these interactions, so that they support the overall project deliverables. However, as courses primarily intend to build students’ key competencies in sustainability, including the competence to collaborate in teams and with stakeholders, there are opportunities to utilize these interactions more directly to build students’ interpersonal competence. This study offers insights from project-based sustainability courses at universities in Germany, the U.S., Switzerland, and Spain to empirically explore such opportunities. We investigate how students develop interpersonal competence by learning from (rather than through) their interactions with peers, instructors, stakeholders, and mentors. The findings can be used by course instructors, curriculum designers, and program administrators to more deliberately use the interactions with peers, instructors, stakeholders, and mentors in project-based sustainability courses for developing students’ competence to successfully collaborate in teams and with stakeholders. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of this work is to find out the perception that students in 4th year compulsory secondary education have of the teaching of key competences, as well as the possibility these have of being transferred to a real, everyday situation, according to what they have learned in the subject of Geography and History. For this, an intentional sample was configured in which more than 1400 subjects from 4th year of secondary education (in Spain) have participated, with a level of significance of 0.05 using a scale—original and unpublished—called (EPECOCISO—Evaluation of the Perception of Social Science Competences). It is a quantitative descriptive study in which—through an exploratory factorial analysis—factors 1, 2, and 3 have been selected for the realization of a descriptive study. Subsequently, correlation between factors has been established through the Pearson test and between the different variables that make up each one of them with the socio‐demographic variables (distinguishing between ordinal and nominal variables), through the chi‐square independence test and Cramerʹs V test (nominal) and the linearity test and Goodmanʹs and Kruskalʹs Gamma test (ordinal). Finally, it can be concluded that a methodology based and organized around the development of critical thinking facilitates the acquisition of contents and competences, as well as allowing students to detect the possibility of transferring them and putting them into practice in a real situation that can be presented. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - While learning competencies in education for sustainable development are increasingly recognized as important, few empirical studies consider competencies delivered at a program level. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how a program evaluation can be approached through a participatory approach, and what this means for learning competencies for sustainability. The innovative method chosen was to implement a student-led evaluation of the program or a form of practice-based learning whereby students engaged in a participatory evaluation of their own program. This evaluation involved a mixed-methods research design and engaging with different actors—from other students and teachers in the program to alumni, administrators and employers. Students agreed on what competencies to evaluate against, then designed their assessment to gauge how and in what way five key competencies were being delivered. The program delivers competencies for sustainable development, yet there was some discrepancy between what students experienced in the program and what teachers believed to be delivering in the classroom. The learning-by-doing approach suggests that a sixth competency—implementation skills—is relevant to teaching for sustainable development. A participatory, student-led approach to evaluating a Master program is a novel contribution to the literature, which in itself led to the development of competencies for sustainability, particularly strategic, interpersonal and implementation skills. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The world faces significant challenges that require transformative changes facilitated by Sustainability Change Agents (SCAs). Universities around the world have explicitly taken up the responsibility of developing in students the skills and knowledge (i.e., competencies) necessary to be successful SCAs. While there is clear convergence around planning competencies, intrapersonal and implementation competencies have recently emerged in the literature. These competencies will have to remain effective even in the face of adversity, yet too little is known about sources of motivation for SCAs and how motivation can be maintained despite these inevitable setbacks. Since the needed transformations will be collective processes, motivation to be a SCA needs to be understood in the social and realistic context in which they would be applied. This study sought to gain specific insights into: 1.) What motivates students to be SCAs? 2.) How do these SCAs maintain their motivation in the face of setbacks? 3.) What can higher education institutions (e.g., universities, colleges) do to better support the motivation of SCAs? In order to gain insights into these questions, 83 aspiring SCAs were surveyed and their responses analyzed using qualitative content analysis. For this group of SCAs, the key source of motivation evolved from a focus on nature, learning, and individual behavior to a more social view with a concern for structural change. Moreover, social networks and intrapersonal skills helped to restore students' motivation following setbacks. Despite being university students, the SCAs surveyed had already experienced significant setbacks and, largely without institutional support, learned strategies to overcome them and maintain their motivation. Motivation and the skills, knowledge, and experience of how to maintain the drive for positive change in the face of setbacks is crucial in order for SCAs to be capable of supporting the critically needed transformations, and universities must play their part in fostering the SCAs' capability.  © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.

AB  - Crisis situations such as the current Covid‐19 pandemic are a catalyst for change. This study stresses the need to work towards achieving quality education, and to prepare future teachers in sustainability competencies. The research questions are related to the key competencies necessary to accelerate change and to how to increase awareness and literacy of the SDGs in higher education. A quantitative methodology aimed at improving the training of future teachers who engage in reflective and critical thinking was used. Data were gathered on the level of reflection of students from three Spanish universities. The instrument used, the Reflective Practice Questionnaire, includes concepts defined in the literature related to reflective capacity such as Reflection in Action, Reflection on Action and Reflection with Others. The results of the study provide quantitative data showing a positive impact of reflective practice on future teachers. Education for sustainable development requires participatory methods that motivate and empower students to change their behaviour. Reflective practice must be accompanied by processes of communication and supervision that encourage confidence and the desire to improve. Training future teachers in reflective practice should be a differentiating element to achieve quality education, allowing adaptation to current and future adverse situations. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of this article is to present the results of the empirical validation of the PROFICIENCyIn + E rubric for teacher self-evaluation, which allows us to know to what extent primary and secondary teachers consider themselves competent in eleven of the key competencies that have been identified through the review of the literature. The rubric has an online format and digital access through a learning management system aimed at schools. After completing it, teachers receive a personalized report on their competence profile. The reliability results show acceptable indices of internal consistency and empirical validation through the Multidimensional Non-Metre Scaling (PROXSCAL) procedure, suggesting that the rubric is an effective tool to evaluate teaching skills in non-university teaching. The use of this tool offers real opportunities for self-improvement and reflection amongst teachers related to their competencies and how to plan their professional development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Numerous investigations have highlighted the importance of examining teachers’ responses to the curricular reforms in science teaching proposed by the educational authorities. Science teachers’ responses are shaped by their perceptions of the new measures’ intentions and their level of involvement. Purpose: This study analyses the evolution of the teachers´ beliefs and opinions to externally driven curriculum reform in Spain focused on developing key competences. Sample: Four secondary science teachers participated in a training programme in which a context-based approach to teaching scientific competences was implemented. Design and methods: The data analysis applied a scheme that differentiates the personal, internal and external focus of teachers’ work. It also introduced the qualifier concept, whether their responses were seen as facilitating (F) or obstacles (O) the development of competence-based science education. The data was obtained from different settings: two individual interviews with each teacher and a focus group carried out with the four teachers Results: The teachers' perceptions cover many aspects (20), which have all been categorized into the 27 factors included in the scheme used. The teachers’ perceptions were mainly on the personal focus at all training programme settings. However, their responses also reflected factors related to the internal and external focuses, though to a lesser extent. Conclusion: The study´s findings show the influence of reflection on the teachers’ observations and impressions, helping them elicit many factors according to Ryder´s proposal. As for the qualifiers expressed by the teachers, the evaluations depended on the teacher profile and the settings used. These considerations highlight the influence of training and experiential knowledge on professional development. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Knowledge and skill acquisition to perform an accurate respiratory system assessment is a key competency expected in undergraduate nursing students. Learning physical assessment requires the integration of multiple knowledge bases and skills; hence, applying an innovative teaching approach, such as the flipped-classroom (FC) approach, fosters an active and student-centered learning environment for physical assessment class. Objectives: This study evaluated FC's feasibility in delivering respiratory system assessment content in a health assessment course and explored the changes in nursing students' perceptions regarding student-centeredness and active learning environments before and after applying FC. Design: A single group pre- and post-test concurrent mixed-methods design was used. Settings: This study was conducted in a private nursing college in South Korea. Participants: A convenience sample of 91 second year undergraduate nursing students enrolled in a health assessment course. Methods: FC was offered at one didactic session of a physical assessment course. In the FC, students completed a self-directed pre-class activities using online lecture videos and reading materials prior to the class and participated in interactive team-based learning activities inside the classroom. Skills lab practicum took place after the FC. Students' perceptions regarding student-centeredness and active learning environments, in terms of teaching, social, and cognitive presences were measured before (T1) and after (T2) conducting the FC. Qualitative data were obtained at T2 using free-response questions, which required students to comment on their FC experience. Results: Participants' perceptions of student-centeredness significantly increased from T1 to T2. Although student-perceived teaching and social presence in their learning environment showed upward trends from T1 to T2, these changes were not statistically significant. Students considered FC an acceptable approach to foster active learning in a supportive learning environment. Conclusions: This study revealed that incorporating FC to deliver respiratory system assessment content was feasible and considered acceptable by undergraduate nursing students. © 2020

AB  - Creating societies of the future goes hand in hand with promoting sustainable education and, therefore, universities must train educators who, through their own professional development, put into practice methodologies that are active, participative, and focused on the overall development of their students. The use of methodologies like Design Thinking and the use of social networks generate learning dynamics that bring into play key competences in the development of dedicated future educators. In this study, 156 students from Education degrees at the University of Jaen analyze how the use of these methodologies supports the learning process in dimensions such as creativity, motivation, communication, and involvement in learning, among others. The results shows that all dimensions correlate positively, and that the benefits derived from the use of these methodologies are perceived by students as greater than the effort required to put them into practice. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, has already begun enabling technological innovations in various domains, especially in the manufacturing and service industry. The conditions of the disruptive new product-service emergence and quickly changing work environments require cultivating a competitive workforce that is equipped with essential knowledge and skills in Industry 4.0. The work presented herein identifies key competencies required for engineers in Industry 4.0 from the extant literature and offers a mechanism to facilitate knowledge and skills acquisition. Specifically, an automated planning software tool, iCoursePlanner, is proposed to recommend an optimized pathway to attain the identified competencies through not only offline courses in a college but also Massive Open Online Courses. This tool is based on a mobile app system in a cloud environment integrated with an optimization model for automated planning. iCoursePlanner uses the initial knowledge and goal knowledge of a learner to suggest a customized course plan. Case studies are conducted for industrial and manufacturing engineering students at Iowa State University and Bradley University to demonstrate how it can be used to help a student to acquire key competencies for Industry 4.0. The originality of the proposed automated course planning tool is rooted in the personalized course plan for each student that considers individual educational background and goal knowledge. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - (1) Background: Corporate social entrepreneurship (CSE) is a young phenomenon courting recognition that is attracting increasing attention in academia and corporate practice. Nevertheless, it has rarely found its way into the curricula of higher education institutions (HEI), which raises the question of the concept’s potential for further development in the realm of academic teaching; (2) Our study is based on a mostly qualitative research design consisting of expert interviews, focus groups, and a low-standardized survey; (3) Results: Corporate social entrepreneurship is seen as having strong potential to enrich education at institutions of higher learning, to establish new forms of teaching, and to bridge the gap between higher education and society; (4) Conclusions: Although our results indicate industry need and student demand for competent corporate social entrepreneurs, German HEIs have not yet integrated CSE-specific education into their curricula. However, the required competences are covered by CSE-related fields of study, which hampers the holistic education of CSE learners. A CSE curriculum needs to cover core CSE concepts as well as key competences, and the engagement of quadruple helix stakeholders requires an adjustable and transversal approach of curriculum development. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose Among the roles of the competent physician is that of a professional, according to the Canadian Medical Education Directives for Specialists (CanMEDS) framework, which describes the abilities physicians require to effectively meet the health care needs of the people they serve. Through examination of preceptor field notes on resident performance, the authors identified aspects of this role with which family medicine residents struggle. Method The authors used a structured thematic analysis in this qualitative study to explore the written feedback postgraduate medical learners receive at the University of Toronto Department of Family and Community Medicine. Seventy field notes written between 2015 and 2017 by clinical educators for residents who scored "below expectation" in the CanMEDS professional role were analyzed. From free-text comments, the authors derived inductive codes, amalgamated the codes into themes, and measured the frequency of the occurrence of the codes. The authors then mapped the themes to the key competencies of the CanMEDS professional role. Results From the field notes, 7 themes emerged that described reasons for poor performance. Lack of collegiality, failure to adhere to standards of practice or legal guidelines, and lack of reflection or self-learning were identified as major issues. Other themes were failure to maintain boundaries, taking actions that could have a negative impact on patient care, failure to maintain patient confidentiality, and failure to engage in self-care. When the themes were mapped to the key competencies in the CanMEDS professional role, most related to the competency "commitment to the profession." Conclusions This study highlights aspects of professional conduct with which residents struggle and suggests that the way professionalism is taught in residency programs - and at all medical training levels - should be reassessed. Educational interventions that emphasize learners' commitment to the profession could enhance the development of more practitioners who are consummate professionals. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Companies are confronted with increasingly demanding environments, including globalization, technologization, intergenerationality, and crises such as the coronavirus pandemic. To accept uncertainties as a challenge and to recognize opportunities for development, well-educated and resilient founders are needed who can foster innovation and sustainable development within society and the economy. The majority of today’s entrepreneurs have an academic background. Hence, institutions for higher education need to provide comprehensive educational offerings and support initiatives to train and sensitize future entrepreneurs. Therefore, since 2013, agile teaching formats have been developed in our project at a Bavarian university of applied sciences. In two stages, we founded a limited company for hands-on experimentation with entrepreneurship and also conceptualized an elective course and an annual founders’ night. Based on a theoretical model and continuous teaching evaluations, we adjusted the individual modules to suit the target group. The objective is to promote the acquisition of key competencies and exert a positive influence on the startup quotient in the region. There are six startups by students who can be traced back to our project. This indicates that a target-group-oriented educational program encourages motivation and awareness of entrepreneurial thinking and action among students. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Ethics is a key competence to be acquired by physiotherapy students to ensure quality care. However, students may not be aware of the importance of ethics for the development of their clinical practice, in the same way that their attitudes towards Professional Ethics are unknown within their curriculum. Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify the attitudes towards learning Professional Ethics among undergraduate students of Physiotherapy Degree and compare the attitude between the educational years. Design: A cross-sectional study was carried out. Settings. Physiotherapy Degree at the University of Valencia, Spain. Participants: In the study 340 physiotherapy students participated. Methods: This was a quantitative study with a cross-sectional observational design. The students of the different years of the Physiotherapy Degree had to complete the Attitudes Questionnaire towards Professional Ethics in Physiotherapy in order to analyse the study objective. Results: The four educational years' scored 3.80 or more in the questionnaire. Second-year students scored the highest (4.25 ± 0.35) and had significantly more favourable attitudes towards learning ethics in relation to the rest of the years (p = 0.007 vs. first; p < 0.001 vs. third and fourth). First-year students (4.09 ± 0.37) obtained a significantly higher score than third (3.86 ± 0.35) and fourth years (3.80 ± 0.33) with p < 0.001 vs. both third and fourth. Finally, in relation to the 3 categories of the items' questionnaire the mean scores showed significant differences between the second year and the rest of the years. Conclusions: The attitudes towards learning Professional Ethics among students of the Physiotherapy Degree at the university is favourable, although it varies depending on the academic year, with the students in the academic year in which Ethics is taught (i.e. second year students) being the ones with better attitudes. © 2021

AB  - Problem and goal. Amid the currently advancing (technological, social, techno-social) trends, prominent attention is drawn to skills and competences, which are universal for all spheres of activity - soft skills, key competences. They are known as universal competences in Russian higher education. The aim of the article is to pinpoint universal competences (UCs) and to analyze their specific features in the context of competence-based education. Materials and methods. The authors use methods of etymological, conceptual and comparative analysis combined with dialectical and diachronic approaches and discursive reflection. The study was based on competence-based education-related documents and projects of EU, OECD, UNESCO, the World Bank as well as on monographs and articles of top experts and research groups. Results. During the study, the term of universal competences was differentiated from the associated terms (soft skills, key competencies, generic competencies, and 21st century skills); the role of universal competences was identified as a balancer in higher education for equilibrating its two missions: Preparing students for successful career and helping them become well-rounded personalities. It has been found that the terminological confusion and the lack of consensus on many aspects of competence-based education have an ambivalent character. The idea of universal competences was identified as a Russian version of a tool (and the outcome) of the integration of two opposite intentions of the national educational policy: Blending in the mainstream of the competence-based approach and retaining its uniqueness. A contribution was made to expanding the conception of universalism as the foundation for competence-based education, including the one in Russia. Conclusion. We acknowledge that the concept of universal competences can make competence-based education more balanced in Russian environment or, on the contrary, it can aggravate its inherent imbalance. © 2022 LLC Ecological Help.

AB  - Prior findings highlight school students’ low motivation to study science, while 21st-century education aims to achieve their key competencies: scientific literacy and autonomous problem-solving to be prepared for smooth adaption to quickly changing circumstances. Real-life learning scenarios can meet these shortfalls to engage the learners by the knowledge-in-use perspective. This, however, requires that learners have high-level abilities of complex learning. We conducted a case study of outdoor learning with 8th–graders (age 14–15) to foster their scientific thinking addressing a real-life problem hands-on. Although the results showed that students’ conceptual knowledge increased, they also indicate participants’ cognitive taxonomy difficulties. An insight into the cognitive load aspects is given as it may appear in different autonomous learning situations. This work highlights the aspects little discussed so far (1) school students’ varying cognitive skills; (2) difficulties arising from the high cognitive load caused by multitasking, accompanied by the complex learning approach. This raises the questions of how to conduct motivating science lessons, where to practice the multi-component learning skills; and how to foster autonomous learning, where to gain the relevant knowledge without overburdening novice learners. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The LOMLOE, like any other law concerning education in an advanced democratic society, puts in place a new system to achieve the aims of education. However, as with any other education law, its wording and implementation raise contentious issues. Some are political in nature while others are more specific to the pedagogical field. In any case, they all relate to the purposes of education. This paper presents some of these controversial issues, perhaps the ones that are causing the most debate at a social level, especially in the field of education. These issues are: the idea of educational and social inclusion and how it is managed with regard to state-funded private centres, in particular ones that follow a single-gender education model and ones that cater for special educational needs; the competence-based curriculum and all that this entails; the objective of educational success and the role of evaluation in achieving it; and finally, the question of religion. This article does not set out to criticise the new education law. Instead, it seeks to consider how these controversial issues relate to the purposes of education. It concludes that the LOMLOE has some good points but that at the same time a political approach to the pedagogical predominates, which instead of integrating and opening itself to freedom and plurality, eliminates options without considering pedagogical arguments. © 2022, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

AB  - Introduction: Being able to demonstrate reflection on clinical practice is a key competency required of undergraduate dental students and registrants alike. Academic reflective writing (ARW) is an increasingly widely used genre of writing which evidences reflective practice. ARW is complex, as students need to achieve balance from a challenging mix of personal, academic and evaluative writing. The aim of this study is to analyse four student ARW tasks from a UK Dental School in order to make recommendations regarding the systematic development of student ARW through the dental curriculum. Methods: In this study, a detailed linguistic analysis of high-scoring examples of two first year and two fourth year ARW tasks was undertaken, complemented by comments from interviews with markers of the tasks. Results: The linguistic analysis of high-scoring student ARW revealed five consistent reflective aspects common to all tasks, viz description, feelings, analysis, evaluation and conclusion and action planning. Entry-level and final-year ARW showed a different balance between reflective aspects. Markers’ expectations in the lower years were found to equate to high-quality technical reflection, whereas markers in the higher years expected students to have shifted their perspectives to achieve critical reflection. Conclusion: Whilst this study is limited in its generalisability due to its small-scale exploratory nature, it is hoped that the five reflective aspects, and the categories of reflection put forward here will be useful in stimulating discussion about how to scaffold the development of student ARW (and associated reflective thinking) longitudinally through the dental curriculum. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - With regards to the latest European Recommendations, developing key competences has become an important goal of education. The purpose of this comparative study is to focus on this topic considering the teaching of Latin and Greek in upper secondary school in Italy and Spain. A multiple case study with a mixed research design was used, with 173 students and 25 teachers as participants in the quantitative part and 40 students and 18 teachers in the qualitative part. The underlined results are a) the importance of working on the learning concepts of the students of Classics, as this influences the way they study b) the teaching factors that help pupils to develop key competences are evaluation, feedback, teacher personality, interactivity and discipline. Useful paths for daily teaching and new perspectives for future research in this field are offered.  ©

AB  - Society faces mounting pressures related to economic growth, social injustice, and environmental degradation. Building upon scholarly consensus regarding the necessity of multidisciplinary approaches to address such complex problems, the entrepreneurship classroom, broadly defined, can be a learning laboratory to integrate across disciplines, encouraging more impactful opportunity identification for students looking to create social, environmental, and economically inclusive value. We examined recent exit survey data from graduating seniors at a small, private business college in the US that emphasizes entrepreneurship, finding large gaps in skills and knowledge related to ethics and creative problem solving – both of which are key competencies central to meeting the challenges of building a more sustainable world. To address these identified needs, we developed a co-taught course focused on sustainability and consumerism across liberal arts, physical science, and business disciplines. We present our course material in the context of five key competencies related to teaching sustainability in higher education, and review the strengths and drawbacks of this approach for schools looking to implement a similar design. In a time of economic uncertainty in higher education, our model may be useful for other schools looking to integrate entrepreneurship across disciplines—with little added expense to the institution. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Background: Social and healthcare operating environments are constantly evolving, so educators have major responsibility for ensuring that Evidence-Based Healthcare is included in the education of future healthcare professionals and applied in their practice. A holistic understanding and implementation of evidence-based healthcare competence is critical to the delivery of appropriate, relevant, and effective healthcare. Aim: To identify and describe social and healthcare educators' EBHC competence according to the five main components of the JBI model and associated factors to it. Methods: A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted, with inclusion and exclusion criteria identified according to PICo and PEO inclusion criteria for qualitative and quantitative studies, respectively. Five databases—the CINAHL (EBSCO), PubMed, Scopus, Medic and ProQuest databases— were searched in June 2020. In total, 12 original studies (qualitative and quantitative) were included for quality appraisal, data extraction and narrative synthesis. Results: Key competence areas addressed in the selected studies were integrated into the four components of the JBI model of EBHC (evidence generation, synthesis, transfer, and implementation, and focus on its ultimate goal: global health). In the majority of chosen studies', it was found that educators had a positive attitude towards EBHC and wanted to stay up-to-date in the areas of global health and collaboration. Educators demonstrated their abilities to locate, appraise, and interpret the best current relevant evidence. They knew how to integrate EBHC into their teaching and had strong communication skills in evidence transfer. Their EBHC competence was strongest in the educational context and educators could transfer evidence when teaching but were not able to translate it into how to implement EBHC in clinical care. In addition to higher academic education and work experience, organizational support and continuous education reportedly play essential roles in development of educators' EBHC competence. Conclusion: Measures are needed to maintain and improve social and health educators' EBHC competence and develop robust methods to reliably assess it. © 2021

AB  - The shift from knowledge-based curriculum to a competence-based curriculum for Marketing course undergraduates is crucial in producing work-ready talents. The study focuses on the comparison of Self-Management and Task Management domain attained by final-year marketing students in 5 different higher learning institutions in Malaysia. A survey questionnaire consisting 25 items was distributed to compare the competencies in the Self-Management and Task Management domains among 289 undergraduates. The data was analysed using one-way ANOVA on SPSS program version 26.0. The results indicated a significant difference among the undergraduates’ competency in Self-Management domain between the different groups of HEIs. However, there was no significant difference in the Task Management domain. The Public university and Distance Learning university displayed a high Self-Management competencies with a mean score of 4.04 and 4.02 respectively. The competencies attainment for Task Management domains were moderate. All the universities in this study recorded a high score for the knowledge and skills competencies in the Self-Management domain. This comparative study indicates the emphasis of knowledge and skills in their Marketing courses compared to other competencies. This study is significant to identify instructional improvement to enhance competency based learning to produce work-ready marketing undergraduates. © 2021,Asian Journal of University Education.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This study explores what teachers understand as good oracy (speaking and listening competence as well as body language) in and across subjects, and their perceptions of their own prerequisites in the work of cultivating and assessing students' oracy. The backdrop is the Norwegian curriculum, in which oracy as a key competence is supposed to be taught and assessed across subjects. However, the assessment plan for this key competence was not revised when the curriculum was, leaving the responsibility for assessment planning to each teacher. To uncover the reasoning and judgments behind the teachers' expressed conceptualization, teaching, and assessment of oracy, a rhet-orical topoi analysis was performed on qualitative interviews with nine tenth-grade teachers at the lower secondary level. The findings indicate that teachers find their work related to oracy challenging because they lack education in how to teach and assess oracy. The teachers value oracy, which has subject-specific characteristics that simul-taneously entail consistent features across disciplines. The results show that teachers are future oriented and foster students' abilities to make utterances in a safe environment, which is a stepping stone to empowerment through agency, life-mastery, critical thinking, democracy, and rhetorical citizenship. © 2022 The authors.

AB  - The article presents our Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) activities in the project-based Science education of third graders (8–9-year-old pupils) in the Slovak Republic. Individual tasks of project assignment titled “Temperature Measurement” were conceived for “guided inquiry”. We also supported the IBL of pupils by interactive education strategy–Integrated e-Learning (INTe-L). The strategy was built on the role of interactive simulations and experimenting at the knowledge acquisition. The following INTe-L components were used: (a) on-site and remote experiments, (b) interactive simulations and (c) electronic study materials. The research was based the hypothesis that the project-based teaching of the topic “Temperature Measurement” using the IBL activities is significantly more efficient than traditional (instructivist) way of teaching. To verify the hypothesis, we carried out a pedagogical experiment on a sample of 60 respondents. The third graders were divided into two parallel groups: an experimental group (EG, 30 pupils) and control group (CG, 30 pupils). To get a relevant feedback, pre-test and post-test were developed and applied. The results attained in the EG were statistically processed, evaluated, and subsequently compared with those in the CG. The analysis of the results attained by the EG showed that their knowledge acquisition has been increased by 24% compared to CG. We have created a methodology for making simple scientific project assignments with the implementation of all components of the new integrated e-learning education strategy (real and real remote experiment, e-simulation, e-learning material). On a specific example of the topic “Temperature Measurement” in primary education, we have pre-sented the possibility of using a “guided inquiry” in the implementation of individual experimental tasks. We have introduced a form of teamwork that allows to harmonize the teaching requirements with individual learning approach and helps to prepare pupils for planned work and independent knowledge acquisition and problem solving. The study has shown that complex IBL activities can be successfully applied at primary school 3rd grade level already. Our form of education with the wider use of modern information and communication technologies (ICT) was attractive for the learners and helped them to develop interdisciplinary relationships. The integrated e-learning has helped third grades to develop a deeper conceptual understanding of temperature and allowed them to prepare presentations to demonstrate their conceptual knowledge. The approach allowed pupils to gain key competencies in Science (discussion and presentation of results). It has also increased the pupils’ interest in Science in general and helped them to understand links between different subjects. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Coaching literature assumes that people undergo personal change through coaching. We contend that different types of change may occur with coaching and investigate whether this is the case in reflection (a key competence in coaching). Results from our sample of 61 coachees indicate that three types of change (alpha, beta, gamma) are observed across participants. Alpha change refers to a substantive change in reflection (i.e. an increase or decrease), beta to a recalibration of one's assessment of reflection and gamma to a re-conceptualization of reflection. We further examine implicit person theory (IPT) as a predictor and perceived coaching utility as a correlate of the three types of change. We observe a higher probability that incremental IPT will associate with alpha change versus other types of change, and that beta and gamma changes correlate positively and negatively, respectively, with perceived utility for work. No significant correlations are observed between types of change and perceived utility for personal development. Our study represents an exploratory contribution to a better understanding of the within-person changes in reflection following coaching intervention, and has implications for both theory and practice, which we discuss along with indications for future directions. © 2021 Brian Towers (BRITOW) and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Many instructors of program evaluation incorporate team-based service projects into their courses. What is often overlooked is that it provides a golden opportunity for students to reflect on the interpersonal skills necessary for teamwork. This paper explains how we leveraged service project working groups to include reflection on interpersonal skills. Minor changes were made to the Team Performance Scale (TPS), a tool used for team-based learning in medical education. We found it to be a practical and effective way to engage students in reflecting on behaviours associated with a high functioning team. This practice note will be of interest to instructors using team learning approaches to teach key competencies in program evaluation. © 2021 Canadian Journal of Program Evaluation / La Revue canadienne d'évaluation de programme 35.3 (Special Issue / Numéro spécial), 395-402

AB  - The study of economics involves core issues of sustainable development very relevant to society, such as growth, consumption or wellbeing. Accordingly, its epistemology and teaching contents influence other disciplines, the conception of society and the political agenda. From this perspective, it is strategic that the teaching of economics promotes sustainable development. The aim of this article is to examine what the subjects of economics and business economics teach about sustainability at the upper secondary education level in Spain, and if they contribute to the acquisition of the key competencies of the education for sustainable development. A content analysis is carried out of both the curriculum and the textbooks to that end. Our results emphasise that the ideas, concepts and values transmitted by the Spanish upper secondary economics textbooks do not adequately promote knowledge about sustainability or the learning of the key competencies. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Developing communication skills is a key competency for residents. Coaching, broadly accepted as a training modality in medical education, has been proven a successful tool for teaching communication skills. Little research is available thus far to investigate virtual coaching on communication skills for telemedicine encounters. The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that virtually coaching residents on communication skills is feasible and acceptable. We surveyed 21 resident-faculty pairs participating in a “fully virtual” coaching session (patient, coach, and resident were virtual). Methods: We asked 50 neurology resident-faculty coach pairs to complete one “fully virtual” coaching session between May 20 and August 31, 2020. After each session, the resident and coach completed a 15-item survey, including Likert-style scale and open-ended questions, assessing feasibility and acceptability. Descriptive statistics and qualitative content and thematic analyses were performed. Results: Forty-two percent (21/50) of all eligible residents completed “fully virtual” coaching sessions. The overall survey response rate was 91 % (38/42). The majority of respondents agreed that the direct observation and debriefing conversation were easy to schedule and occurred without technical difficulties and that debriefing elements (self-reflection, feedback, takeaways) were useful for residents. Ninety-five percent of respondents rated the coach’s virtual presence to be not at all disruptive to the resident-patient interaction. Virtual coaching alleviated resident stress associated with observation and was perceived as an opportunity for immediate feedback and a unique approach for resident education that will persist into the future. Conclusions: In this pilot study, residents and faculty coaches found virtual coaching on communication skills feasible and acceptable for telemedicine encounters. Many elements of our intervention may be adoptable by other residency programs. For example, residents may share their communication goals with clinic faculty supervisors and then invite them to directly observe virtual encounters what could facilitate targeted feedback related to the resident’s goals. Moreover, virtual coaching on communication skills in both the in-person and telemedicine settings may particularly benefit residents in challenging encounters such as those with cognitively impaired patients or with surrogate decision-makers. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Graduate programs should be operated based on professionalism. The purpose of this study was to investigate the professionalism of thirteen doctoral dance programs in Korea. The study included thirteen doctoral programs from 10 universities in Korea. Data on the dance programs were collected using school bulletins, websites, and booklets. Educational goals, doctoral program requirements, and syllabi were analyzed based on the documents of each graduate school. Although most graduate school dance programs offered similar characteristics of courses, programs majorly comprised theory, performance, and workshops. Dance performance appeared to be an important aspect of dance programs in Korea. Interestingly, three different genres of dance (Korean folk dance, modern dance, and ballet) were overwhelmingly present in doctoral programs. This study recommended that more research-and scholastic-oriented programs should be provided in doctoral programs to enhance the fundamentals of the dance academic environment. Overall, more specialized programs are required to meet the various needs and choices of the doctoral students. It is certain that students’ interests and academic excellence are the greatest assets for doctoral dance major students. The concepts of diversity, culture, and interdisciplinary cooperation should be applied more to the description and research of graduate courses. Operationalizing these efforts through rigorous assessments of students’ mastery of key competencies in the curriculum is another evolving task for sustainable education leaders. © 2021 by the author.

AB  - The educational process is by its nature and essence very dialectical, so it necessarily requires teachers to have a developed whole set of various competencies. The aim of the research was to examine teachers on self-assessment of competencies that were crucial for innovating the teaching process. The sample of respondents included 1300 elementary and secondary school teachers in the territory of Southern Serbia. The instrument used was a five-point TCS scale of attitudes, with a total of 48 items (individual competencies). The results of the analysis showed that teachers, based on their self-assessments, highly value all diverse groups of competencies, which fully confirms the general hypothesis. The results also showed the existence of statistically significant differences in the degree of expression of attitudes about competency groups with regard to independent research variables, within special hypotheses, based on which the first was rejected, the second partially and the third and fourth special hypothesis fully confirmed. The issue of key competencies of teachers is certainly one of the fundamental issues when it comes to quality teaching, its innovation, generally successful and efficient dealing with the educational process. Based on these postulates, there is hope that the obtained research results will represent a good starting point and incentive for further research work in this field in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This study explored teachers' beliefs about mathematical problem-solving. It involved 36 identified teachers of Kayonza District in Rwanda via an explanatory mixed-method approach. The findings indicate that most teachers show a positive attitude towards advancing problem-solving in the mathematics classroom. However, they expose different views on its implementation. Role of problem-solving, Mathematical problems, and Problem-solving in Mathematics were identified as main themes. Problem-solving was highlighted as an approach that helps teachers use time adequately and helps students develop critical thinking and reasoning that enable them to face challenges in real life. The study recommends teacher professional development initiatives with their capacity to bring problem-solving to standard. © Authors.

AB  - Teaching formats involving non-university partners are increasingly gaining importance to deliver key competencies needed in higher education for sustainable development. Such teaching formats may also create new transdisciplinary spaces that allow different actors to impact regional transition towards sustainable development. Against this background, this article focuses on how universities foster regional transition through teaching, particularly in collaboration with local nonuniversity. Using the interdisciplinary certificate programs on sustainable development offered by the German Universities of Tübingen and Duisburg-Essen as case studies, we analyze the potentials and challenges of teaching programs on sustainable development for promoting regional transition. Leaning on the multi-level-perspective-approach, we have used qualitative interviews to shed light on the design of cooperation between the university and regional partners as well as the creation and integration of transdisciplinary learning spaces. This paper shows that the impact of such teaching formats on the regional transition consists primarily of awareness and network building. One of the most fundamental challenges faced is unequal power relations in terms of access to resources, financing, and doing the course planning. Simultaneously, co-design, mutual understanding, and collective decisions on roles and responsibilities and-especially-empathy and trust are crucial factors for successfully teaching cooperation towards regional sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The key competences for sustainable development, among which is digital competence, will not be achieved without the integration of values in education. The objective of this research was to identify and analyze the relationships between the values taught in schools and mobile addiction. The study design was predictive correlational. The sample consisted of 1453 students of primary and secondary education (61.3% women; 38.7% men). The findings have shown a significant correlation between the values taught in schools and mobile phone addiction. It is concluded that the greater the formation of values, the less the mobile addiction. These correlations are especially significant regarding social values such as solidarity, inclusion, and justice, and personal values such as enthusiasm, patience, impartiality, openness of ideas, honesty, and balance. Likewise, there are significant differences depending on the educational stage; the younger the age, the less the mobile addiction. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background and Context: Computational thinking and practices (CT|P) are key competencies for learners in science and engineering. For studies with young adolescents as participants, manifested research philosophies are sometimes inconsistent with societal pluralisms. Objective: Based on research literature from 2016 to early 2019 for CT|P in required science and engineering classes with youth ages 10-15–a sensitive age range for cognitive and affective development–we wrote a literature review that argues for the use of more pluralistic and critical research philosophies, which will strengthen research design, implementation, and meta-inferences (Collins et al., 2012). Method: We analyzed 20 qualifying studies per research philosophies common to mixed research, giving extra attention to studies that acknowledge cultural pluralisms, engage those pluralisms in conversation with each other, and ensure that historically marginalized populations have equiTable–not just equal–participation (Onwuegbuzie & Frels, 2013). Findings: We found that studies consistently emphasized pragmatism-of-the-middle and communities of practice; sometimes operated within critical realist, pragmatism-of-the-right, or transformative-emancipatory philosophies; and rarely engaged in dialectical ways. Implications: To avoid decontextualized or overly individualistic approaches that fail to address systemic and institutional social inequities (in education, housing, healthcare, policing, voting, etc.), future work should take more pluralistic and critical philosophical approaches. We highlight several exemplars in hope that research will support youth in maintaining and extending computational practices in culturally sustaining ways (Paris, 2012). © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has turned attention to the essential competencies needed to confront pandemics for a physician. However, medical students, as future physicians, are not adequately trained for such a situation. This study aimed to determine the essential competencies for a medical student to face the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed this mixed-method needs assessment study at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in May-June 2020 in three steps: the first step was a brainstorming session followed by a nominal group technique with the experts' participation. The second step was determining the validity of competencies by calculating the content validity ratio. In the third and last step, three rounds of the modified Delphi technique were held with the participation of 22 medical faculty members and 45 undergraduate medical students to reach a consensus about the competencies utilizing quantitative analysis. RESULTS: A total of 30 key competencies essential for a medical student were obtained through the current study. They were categorized into four major themes: (1) developing knowledge and abilities for effective diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, (2) demonstrating safety principles correctly, (3) demonstrating effective behavior, and (4) determining the meta-competencies. CONCLUSIONS: Although medical students will be the frontline physicians in the future pandemics, they are not prepared to display the diversity of requisite skills to practice effectively and safely. This study provides essential competencies for medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic and underlines the importance of a paradigm shift from traditional time-based to competency-based education. © 2021 International Journal of Preventive Medicine.

AB  - Digital skills are one of the key competences outlined in The European Reference Framework of Key Competences for Lifelong Learning prescribed by the EU in 2006. Integration of digital tools and resources into the classroom results in more platforms for teaching and learning activities. Teacher training programmes prepare pre-service teachers with pedagogical competencies and skills necessary for their future practices. This paper shows that pre-service teachers could overcome the pedagogical challenges during COVID-19 teaching by updating their present and future classroom teaching strategies around digital literacy. To explore further how these new teaching circumstances are understood and reflected on by pre-service teachers, the researchers collected written reflections of 52 pre-service teachers in Norway using an open-ended survey about their digital integration experiences in their practicum. This paper offers analyses of the reflections inductively to reveal the teachers’ process of development of their classroom teaching strategies as influenced by new digitalisation-related experiences. The findings show low levels of digital integration according to the SAMR model but moderate to high levels of satisfaction among pre-service teachers of digital practices. In the light of these findings, this study offers pedagogical technological implications for teachers and teacher educators who work with teacher education curricula. © the authors.

AB  - Competence-based education is a widely implemented educational approach, but more research is needed into the relationship between transversal competences and individual disciplines. In this article, we present the results of a study focusing on how the transversal competence of multiliteracy is contextually defined in Finnish local curricula in the disciplines of mathematics and social studies. The article offers new insights into the discussion between content- and competence-based educations by introducing the concept of disciplinary contextualisation. Based on the qualitatively analysed data, four different types of disciplinary contextualisation are presented and further discussed. The study also engages with the discussion in the field of multiliteracy by offering insights into the ways in which multiliteracy is rationalised, defined, and developed in the analysed disciplines. Multiliteracy contextualisations share features, but also differences, between the disciplines, illustrating the importance of taking into account the disciplinary perspective when discussing the development of competences in basic education. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Competence‐based education has been in the spotlight for several years, and it is a topical issue in the European Union as well as marking the reform of the Latvian education system. The Council of the EU considers entrepreneurial competence to be one of the key competences for lifelong learning, and Latvia’s school reforms require teachers to create a study process where students develop entrepreneurial competence. This publication presents research on the self‐assessed entrepreneurial competence of teacher education students to find out whether there is any correlation between their assessment of entrepreneurial competence and their readiness/ability to develop this competence in their students, as well as which methods/activities they see as suitable to do so in the classroom and the remote study process. An online survey using the QuestionPro platform was used to collect the data. The questionnaire was fully completed by 157 pedagogy students from various higher education institutions, and it consisted of four question blocks: demographic and socio‐cultural questions, entrepreneurial competence, digital competence, and open‐ended ques-tions. The data provided by the questionnaire developed for this research showed that students’ self‐assessed entrepreneurial competence in a remote study process rated their digital competences highest, followed by their entrepreneurial competences. The results indicate that students are suffi-ciently prepared to be able to further develop their entrepreneurial competence in the remote study process. From the data, it can be concluded that higher education needs to focus on the development of entrepreneurial competence and should also supplement the methodological knowledge of students to improve their readiness to teach entrepreneurial competences to others. It should also be noted that there is a strong correlation between students’ entrepreneurial competence and their readiness to teach entrepreneurial competences to others. An online survey using the QuestionPro platform was used to collect the data. The questionnaire was fully completed by 157 pedagogy students from various higher education institutions, and it consisted of four question blocks: demographic and socio‐cultural questions, entrepreneurial competence, digital competence, and open-ended questions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - University students are expected to have the appropriate digital competence to face the demands of the changing educational model and to meet the challenges of the future work. This paper describes university students’ perceptions of digital competence and analyzes the impact of personal factors on digital competence in a sample of 5164 students from all majors in the first and fourth year of their studies at Gansu Agricultural University (China). A quantitative methodology was followed, employing a non-experimental method and the survey technique to collect data. The results obtained show that students’ perceptions of digital competencies in terms of information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, and safety were positive. Furthermore, there were significant differences in students’ self-perceptions of digital competence related to gender, grade level, area of residence, and prior relevant training in the DigComp framework-based instrument. The development of key competency areas for digital competence, such as the creation of digital content, should be promoted, along with helping students to gain knowledge when dealing with everyday technological issues. The need for training related to the use of ICT and digital competencies was also highlighted, as well as supporting the promotion of female students in selected areas of digital competence and assisting lower grade students and students from rural areas in digital competence development. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The recent round of curriculum reform in China has proposed the educational goal of developing key competencies. This study examined how key competencies are integrated into geography textbooks for middle schools through pre-designed activities. The results showed that the textbooks emphasized the regional awareness competency. The activities in these geography textbooks promoted key competencies differently across the school years, and each competency showed a different type of learning progress over time. © 2022 National Council for Geographic Education.

AB  - Introduction: Managing patients with chronic pain can be complex and requires specialized clinical knowledge and advanced communication skills. Simulation-based learning has been shown to improve learning outcomes for complex competencies and could be a valuable resource for trainees in chronic pain medicine. Methods: We assessed the need for a simulation-based course for trainees in chronic pain medicine at McMaster University in Canada. The needs assessment consisted of three steps: (1) literature review to identify preexisting needs assessments, (2) targeted interviews with six healthcare professionals in chronic pain management, and (3) an analysis of 366 routinely collected patient experience surveys. Results: The systematic review identified a small body of related literature and no previous needs assessment. We identified the following key competencies and skills that trainees in pain medicine need to develop: (1) communicating with distressed patients using skills such as de-escalation, active listening, and motivational interviewing, (2) managing patients in difficult emotional situations such as poorly controlled pain or showing signs of opioid misuse, and (3) recognizing and managing mental health issues related to chronic pain using appropriate instruments. Discussion: Suggestions for scenarios included the following: (1) consulting a patient with poor pain control and running out of treatment options, (2) managing a patient with suspected inappropriate opioid use, and (3) diagnosing depression in a patient suffering from chronic pain and developing an appropriate treatment plan. Conclusion: We propose the development of suggested scenarios into simulation-based courses, and test and refine them together with trainees and experts in pain medicine. © 2021, International Association of Medical Science Educators.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to investigate student experiences and the potential impact of experience-based learning (EBL) in the early phase of graduate sustainability programs through the lens of key competencies. The goal is to provide evidence for the improvement of existing and the thorough design of new EBL formats in sustainability programs. Design/methodology/approach: This comparative case study focuses on the first semester of three graduate sustainability programs at Leuphana University of Lüneburg, Germany and Arizona State University, USA, for two of which EBL was a core feature. The study compares the curricula, the teaching and learning environments and the reported experiences of one student cohort from each of three programs and synthesizes the resulting insights. Student interviews were combined with student self-assessments and supported by in-vivo observations, curriculum designer input, instructor interviews and course materials. MAXQDA was used for data analysis following a grounded theory approach. Findings: EBL influences students’ reflective capacity, which impacts the development of key competencies in sustainability. Qualitative analysis found four key themes in relation to the students’ learning in EBL settings, namely, discomfort, time-attention relationship, student expectations of instructors and exchange. The intersection of these themes with curricular structure, student dispositions and differing instructor approaches shows how curriculum can either support or interrupt the reflective cycle and thus, holistic learning. Research limitations/implications: With the focus on the first semester only, the students’ competence development over the course of the entire program cannot be demonstrated. Learning processes within EBL settings are complex and include aspects outside the control of instructors and curriculum designers. This study addresses only a select number of factors influencing students’ learning in EBL settings. Practical implications: Early engagement with EBL activities can push students to leave their comfort zones and question previous assumptions. Designing curricula to include EBL while encouraging strong intra-cohort connections and creating space for reflection seems to be an effective approach to enable the development of key competencies in sustainability. Originality/value: This paper investigates the experiences of students in EBL through a key competence lens. The study combines student self-perceptions, instructor reflections and in-vivo observations. Data collection and analysis were conducted by a researcher not affiliated with the programs. These factors make for a unique study design and with data-driven insights on the seldom researched competence-pedagogy-curriculum connection. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Construction managers are the drivers of project success. To perform well, they need to possess key competencies, such as knowledge, skills, and attitudes, all of which can be improved through proper training. However, despite the skill shortage that still exists in the construction industry, extant literature does not precisely reveal the training methods and training approaches that can impart to construction managers the knowledge, skills, and attitudes they require. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify training methods and training approaches that can develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that construction managers require. The paper presents the results of a Delphi study with 12 experts and 44 professionals, who were asked to provide their opinions on training methods and training approaches that can be adopted to develop the core competencies expected of construction managers. The study revealed 20 elements of knowledge, skills, and attitudes that are most significant to construction managers in the form of competencies and the training methods and training approaches that can deliver those competencies. The most significant knowledge was found to be schedule management and planning, the most significant skill time management and the most significant attitude supportive leadership. Furthermore, learning by doing and private training provided within the workplace were identified as the most favourable training methods and training approaches, respectively for construction managers to acquire the significant competencies they require. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Eighty-four articles are examined in this systematic research review, to provide a synthesis of the state of art with regard to educational research that focused on competence-based education (CBE) and curricula covering a period of 20 years from 1997 to 2017. Relying on PRISMA methodology and framed by discursive institutionalism, and curriculum and Didaktik traditions theoretically, the review was guided by two overarching research questions, focusing first on how much and what educational research on CBE approaches is available, and secondly, primarily in the present article, on the definitions that are reported in CBE research in terms of explicit and systematic versus implicit and tacit references, main educational perspectives/paradigms and academic versus applied orientation. Findings show Spain and New Zealand with most articles related to educational research on CBE, and identify four sources of competence definitions: OECD/DeSeCo, European Commission, national policy documents and the academic literature. It is concluded that there is still unfinished business for educational researchers in critically engaging with framing and defining competences for the twenty-first century, their causes, impact and consequences for schooling and learning internationally, as well as how CBE is recontextualised into specific national contexts. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Learning to learn is one of the key competences identified by the European Commission (EC, 2005 and 2006) for education systems. Rigorous evaluation instruments are necessary for this competence to be included in curriculum design and teaching–learning processes. Currently available questionnaires are limited and so the present work focuses on the design and validation of a standardised quantitative questionnaire to evaluate the way in which university students manage this competence. A test validation design was employed with a sample of 1237 university students from three universities in Valencia. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed good internal consistency and construct validity outcomes. A final questionnaire was produced which addressed five dimensions/scales (cognitive, metacognitive, affective-motivational, social-relational and ethical) through twenty-one subdimensions/subscales composed of 85 items. This questionnaire was found to be more robust and comprehensive than those that were previously available. The instrument will help to advance knowledge in this area. It is useful for researchers as it can be used for diagnosing and evaluating the competence in question, whilst also comparing results obtained in large population samples. © 2021.

AB  - One of the basic aspects of modern education is the development of key competences. This requirement is included in the legislative acts (domestic ones and those of the European Union) as well as in documents specifying core curricula in individual countries. By analysing this problem as exemplified by Poland, we show that communication competence in the language of the legislative acts, fundamental for a modern, conscious people, is an absent element of key competences. In the article, we show why it is important to learn about the real features of the legislative acts in a rapidly changing, knowledge-oriented society. We present the results of the analysis of the core curriculum applicable in Poland for secondary schools in terms of legal education. We also present a proposal to include issues developing legal communication competence in the secondary school curriculum. © 2021 Author.

AB  - Background: Previous research suggests many of the key competencies comprising effective interprofessional collaboration (IPC) can be improved through interprofessional experiences. However, the optimal design of such experiences remains unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a simulated IPC experience using videoconference versus audio only communication on self-rated interprofessional collaborative competence (ICC) in doctoral nursing and physical therapy students. Methods: Students from each cohort were randomized into pairs, receiving either the videoconference or audio only experience during a simulated case. Students completed the Interprofessional Collaborative Competencies Attainment Survey-Revised (ICCAS-R) pre- and post-experience. Discussion: Overall, students improved ICCAS-R scores from pre to post (p < .001); however, significant effects for group (p =. 713) and group by time (p =. 541) were not observed. Conclusion: Both methods were effective at enhancing self-reported ICC. Future research should continue to explore optimizing IPC experiences. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this rapidly changing world, universities have an increased responsibility to prepare professionals for a sustainable future, and teacher education is not an exception to this. In this study, we observed a group of preservice teachers engaging in a statistical investigation project. Specifically, we examined their degree of statistical knowledge; how effective the project was in enhancing their statistical knowledge and thinking; and how they participated in the project to make and share data-driven decisions. To this end, both qualitative and quantitative investigations were used. With the help of pre-and posttests, we found that the degree of knowledge differed between self-perceived and measured knowledge. Moreover, the results demonstrated the project’s effectiveness in enhancing the participating teachers’ statistical knowledge and thinking, specifically estimating the population mean and its interpretation. In making and sharing their decisions, the participating teachers applied multiple key competencies, crucial for promoting sustainability. Thus, the statistical investigation project was effective for enhancing preservice teachers’ statistical knowledge, thinking skills, and ability to promote sustainability. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives: The outcome of emergency medicine (EM) training is to produce physicians who can competently run an emergency department (ED) shift. However, there are few tools with supporting validity evidence specifically designed to assess multiple key competencies across an entire shift. The investigators developed and gathered validity evidence for a novel entrustment-based tool to assess a resident’s ability to safely run an ED shift. Methods: Through a nominal group technique, local and national stakeholders identified dimensions of performance that are reflective of a competent ED physician and are required to safely manage an ED shift. These were included as items in the Ottawa Emergency Department Shift Observation Tool (O-EDShOT), and each item was scored using an entrustment-based rating scale. The tool was implemented in 2018 at the University of Ottawa Department of Emergency Medicine, and quantitative data and qualitative feedback were collected over 6 months. Results: A total of 1,141 forms were completed by 78 physicians for 45 residents. An analysis of variance demonstrated an effect of training level with statistically significant increases in mean O-EDShOT scores with each subsequent postgraduate year (p < 0.001). Scores did not vary by ED treatment area. Residents rated as able to safely run the shift had significantly higher mean ± SD scores (4.8 ± 0.3) than those rated as not able (3.8 ± 0.6; p < 0.001). Faculty and residents reported that the tool was feasible to use and facilitated actionable feedback aimed at progression toward independent practice. Conclusions: The O-EDShOT successfully discriminated between trainees of different levels regardless of ED treatment area. Multiple sources of validity evidence support the O-EDShOT as a tool to assess a resident’s ability to safely run an ED shift. It can serve as a stimulus for daily observation and feedback making it practical to use within an EM residency program. © 2019 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine

AB  - This study investigates to what extent the popular online gaming platform called Kahoot can be used as a creative and effective tool to promote motivation, engagement and meaningful learning. For this purpose, a quasi-experimental study was conducted with a sample of 101 undergraduate students of education who participated in online Kahoot quizzes by designing their own questions as part of the formative assessment. According to the results of the pre-and post-tests, the integration of this game-based student response system into the teaching process improved students' perception of certain concepts in social science teaching, increased their active participation in the lesson, and motivated them towards learning in a more interactive and stimulating environment. Therefore, it is recommended to take gamification to a whole new level with attractive digital participation platforms to increase motivation and enhance students' learning experience in higher education contexts. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Mining has been embedded in the public consciousness as a dirty, non-innovative, outdated and environmentally harmful industry. Proper education, especially the academic one, becomes crucial to successfully change this image. This article depicts the initial assumptions of the international project Master in Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Technology Integration in Mining (MEITIM), co-financed by EIT Raw Materials, that aims to diagnose the current state of Polish higher education in the field of mining at, among others, the Wroclaw University of Science and Technology (WUST), concerning the experience of the Technical University of Madrid (UPM) and Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT). The MEITIM project allowed identifying the directions of necessary changes in the didactic process as an indispensable set of skills and knowledge for a future mining graduate. Such activities are dictated by many guidelines and arrangements, among others, at the level of the European Commission or key industry institutions such as the International Council on Mining and Metals. These are key competencies that require significant changes in university curricula supporting sustainable development goals in innovative mining. The authors show that there is a link between the condition of the mining industry in Poland, its reputation, and the number of people who want to study mining. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Educators realize the need to provide an inclusive, safe environment in a diverse classroom setting to encourage discussion of sensitive topics. However, descriptions of evidence-based approaches that may help us to meet inclusive pedagogy-related competencies are limited. Here, we describe a discussion format that followed chapter readings from a nonfiction biographical book called Mountains beyond Mountains: The Quest of Dr. Paul Farmer, a Man Who Would Cure the World (2003), by Tracy Kidder. This semester-long effort allowed sufficient time for students to develop an understanding of global public health affairs and to reflect on their own role in this world as responsible citizens. A discussion around several sensitive issues emerged, such as the extent of their belief in faith versus science, their opinion on providing financial aid to developing countries versus addressing public health issues in their home country, stereotypes and how that may spread panic during a public-health emergency. The student essays provided evidence that activities were successful in 1) drawing out students' voices about world affairs, 2) teaching students to empathize with varied belief systems, 3) helping students develop a deeper appreciation of empirical and ethical factors that may affect such issues-all of which are key competencies for an inclusive classroom setting. We believe that the activities are flexible in structure and could be easily incorporated into a biology or liberal arts classroom setting to achieve inclusive pedagogy-related goals. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Digital skills and coping strategies have emerged as key competences for adolescents because of concerns about online risks and opportunities. With smartphones nigh ubiquitous nowadays, mobile applications are a promising tool for reaching adolescents and developing their competences. Because narratives have demonstrated their effectiveness for knowledge acquisition and attitudes, this study explores their use in mobile environments. A mobile application with narrative content was developed for teaching digital skills and coping strategies. A quasi-experiment conducted among 245 adolescents showed that the application was effective. Its use raised the level of personal security skill and intention to use active coping strategies when facing contact online risks. Identification with the main character and mobile acceptance predicted the impact of the app, but narrative transportation did not. This study suggests that narratives in mobile apps can be effective for adolescents. Copyright © 2021 (Isabel Rodríguez-de-Dios, Juan-José Igartua, and Leen d’Haenens).

AB  - Child welfare training programs for new employees strive to develop and implement competency-based training approaches. The authors of this article describe the development and validation of a rubric to measure the readiness of new child welfare workers for client engagement and interviewing. The rubric was designed to measure key competencies, based on a review of the literature, including rapport-building, communication and information gathering; and critical safety assessment. The rubric was designed for use with social simulation training, where participants are observed as they simulate skill demonstration toward mastery of competencies. Analysis of both adult and child rubrics revealed good validity and high inter-rater reliability, highlighting their value for the evaluation of new child welfare worker readiness based on key competencies necessary for effective practice. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Context: International comparative research on Vocational Education and Training (VET) is gaining importance, as global cooperation and mutual learning in VET grows. However, it is characterized by a high degree of complexity, due on one hand, to the heterogeneity of the VET sector, and on the other hand to the unique challenges of international comparisons. In addition, comparative research projects are increasingly conducted in the form of cross-border collaborations, which have their own particular organizational and methodological considerations, opportunities, and challenges. This paper presents an example of a cooperative research process, aimed at investigating the complex phenomenon of the competence-based approach in Russian and Chinese VET. In providing an example of developing an instrument for curriculum analysis and comparison, we discuss and reflect on the methodological and organizational peculiarities and challenges of the research process conducted collaboratively by an international team. Method: The instrument for analysis and comparison of curricular documents, was developed in an iterative multi-stage process, combining deductive and inductive steps. The embeddedness of the elements of a competence-based approach in curricular documents is investigated, using qualitative content analysis. To develop a coding frame, we started with a comprehensive partially systematic literature review of international, Russian and Chinese discourses on competence-based curricula. The frame was built on the selected model of competence-based education, and on accumulated results of the literature analysis of national discourses. Furthermore, during the first coding process, an iterative adaptation of the developed instrument took place. Results: The result of this process was the development of an analysis instrument which, on the one hand, is well-adapted to each national context and, on the other hand, allows a comparison of results along the same dimensions of analysis, in our case, elements of the competence-based approach in curriculum. Conclusion: Developing an analysis framework for a cross-cultural comparative investigation of such a diffuse and heterogeneous construct as the competence-based approach, can pose a methodological challenge for an international team of researchers. However, an effective application of own team resources such as proficiency in different languages, insider and outsider perspectives, along with continuous intensive communication and a flexible, iterative research process, allows development of a well-adapted analysis instrument for international comparison. © 2021 European Research Network Vocational Education and Training.

AB  - —Based on people-oriented moral education, the Key Competency of Chinese Students’ Development highlights the importance of cultivating students’ key competency, which means that students should have the essential character and core ability to adjust lifelong development and meet the demand of social development. According to the High School English Curriculum Standard (2017 Edition), key competency in English refers to language ability, thinking quality, cultural character and learning ability. And on the basis of multiliteracies pedagogy, linguistic symbols and non-linguistic symbols are combined together to create a multimodal teaching environment. And students will obtain new knowledge through four main stages: situated practice, overt instruction, critical framing and transferred practice, leading students mobilize their multiple senses together when learning English and help improve their comprehensive competence, which is in line with cultivating students’ key competency in English. This paper will firstly make a brief introduction of key competency in English based on the High School English Curriculum Standard (2017 Edition) and analyze typical views of multiliteracies pedagogy, then take the reading passage, Learning English from Unit5 Languages around the World, compulsory I, PEP as an example, applying multiliteracies pedagogy to English class, in order to cultivate students’ key competency in English to some extent through multiliteracy training. © 2021 ACADEMY PUBLICATION.

AB  - Liberalization pressures challenge countries to adapt their training systems. This is particularly relevant for coordinated market economies with firm-driven but collectively governed apprenticeship systems. Recent literature has identified different liberalization trajectories for these countries. For instance, segmentalism describes the increasing influence of large employers in Germany. In Denmark, state agencies manage increased flexibility in training through embedded flexibilization. In this paper, we identify a new form of embedded flexibilization, characterized by polite employer domination. We find this trajectory of liberalization in Switzerland, which represents another training system heavily based on firm involvement. We illustrate our argument with the example of short-track apprenticeship training, which has been expanded in all three mentioned countries in response to ongoing liberalization and deindustrialization pressures. In Switzerland, the relevant reform was initiated by the state while business adopted a rather passive role initially. Yet, state actors eventually stepped back and delegated key competences to employers, which implies that the employers’ camp asserted their interests in the end while tolerating some concessions for the benefit of disadvantaged groups. Our process tracing reveals that policy makers used layering to implement short-tracks that enhance social inclusion, while simultaneously increasing the scope of employer cooperation. © 2020, The Author(s).

In doing so, it sets a focus on geographical knowledge and its alteration in times of extraordinary measures to diagnose its challenges. Against the background of current debates on competence- and standard-based education from the sociology and history of education as well as from geography education, problem-centred interviews served to explore the perspectives of 15 German secondary school teachers on the alterations their Geography teaching suffered since the COVID-19 lockdown. Analytical categories were general challenges, communication with stakeholders, educational media usage, and the role of COVID-19 in geographical knowledge acquisition. The results uncovered, along with systemic challenges, two main areas in need of consideration to redefine subject-specific knowledge in times of competence-based education, namely geography teachers' professional identity and perspectives on the role of geographical competencies. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The competence-based approach has entered Finnish education after the recent reform of vocational education. Although there is plenty of research nationally and internationally about the idea of competence-based education, the student perspective has remained in the shadow. This research focused on vocational special education teacher students’ experiences of the competence-based education. They started at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences in 2014 in the new competence-based teacher training program. This was a narrative research focusing on the students’ (N = 20) descriptions of their study processes. The data consisted of their written narratives as well as personal interviews at the beginning and end of the study process. Students’ experiences of the different phases of education and perceived benefits and challenges of competence-based education are introduced as results. While the competence-based education seemed to serve well adult students participating in it, there are many definitions and practices that have to be studied and defined better. Suggestions for future development to enhance both vocational teacher training and competence-based education in general are discussed based on the findings. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Despite being a key competency sought by employers, many college students do not exhibit career readiness upon graduation. Reverse mentoring between students (mentors) and company employees (mentees) is an innovative applied learning experience that helps students gain important job knowledge beyond what is taught in a traditional classroom setting. We report on the implementation of a student-employee reverse mentoring experience with a Fortune 500 company in a qualitative marketing research course. Furthermore, we provide seven steps for replicating the experience across a variety of other marketing courses. Finally, we deliver evidence that the reverse mentoring teaching innovation contributes to students’ preparedness on four important career readiness competencies: critical thinking, teamwork, professionalism, and communication. © 2021 Society for Marketing Advances.

AB  - Over the past number of years, competence management has become a key issue for companies. Similarly, to the importance of knowledge management, competence management considers an individual’s performance, based on his or her knowledge. Thus, knowledge management becomes an important aspect for companies to manage resources, through the ability of characterizing key competences and evaluating how they are improved through past experiences and roles, thus selecting project team members according to the respective existing skills. This paper focuses on the coordination of design activities in order to propose a tool dedicated to operation-level project managers to help prepare their technical teams based on the required skills. The goal is to enhance the effectiveness of the teams, as well as their performance in the short-term, as well as the long-term, while coordinating with the human resources department. This work is based on the results of the Aides et assisTances pour la conception, la conduite et leur coupLage par les connAissanceS – Help and support for design, coordination and their coupling by knowledge (ATLAS, 2008-2011). This project studies the coupling between systems design and management. We propose an initial tool to manage skills in a design project. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop the profile and competencies of a harmonised curriculum for a multi-country regional sector-specific higher education programme. The study, which was based on a case study of Renewable Energy involving six countries in Southern Africa, was based on established methodologies proposed by previous studies on harmonisation and profiling of higher education programmes. The study uses a general curriculum development approach leading to the definition of generic and specific competencies and feeding into a learning taxonomy to create alignment with specific learning outcomes at the intended qualification level. However, the approach extends the harmonisation concept to include industrialisation potential, which is crucial in the developing-country context. This allows for the exploitation of shared resources in sector-specific technology areas and supports the development of regional standards on technology and practice, as part of developing a sustainable regional economic sector. Twenty-two competencies, encompassing both generic and specific competencies, were defined. These competencies were grouped into six key competence areas, and later transformed into four clusters of competencies: core competencies, hard skills, soft skills and attitudes. These four clusters were then placed on a planetary system to represent the meta-profile for the qualification, which forms the framework for the future design of learning materials for the qualification. © 2020 University of Deusto.

AB  - Clinical reasoning for acute dyspnoea: Comparison of final-year medical students from discipline-and competency-based undergraduate programmes. Background: The global shift to competency-based medical education aims to improve the performance of its trainees, including in the key competency domain of clinical reasoning. However, research on whether such education actually improves clinical reasoning is sparse. The purpose of this study is to compare assessed clinical reasoning performance in digitally presented cases of acute dyspnoea between final-year medical students from a traditional, discipline-based and those from an integrated, competency-based undergraduate programme. Methods: A total of 60 medical students in their final-year clerkships participated in the study; 30 were from a discipline-based programme, and 30 were from a competency-based programme of the same faculty. The students completed a knowledge test consisting of 22 single choice items and a computer-based test of clinical reasoning with six video-based case scenarios with different underlying diseases leading to dyspnoea. The operationalized measures of clinical reasoning were the number and relevance of the diagnostic tests chosen, time to diagnosis and diagnostic accuracy. Results: The two groups did not differ in their knowledge of the acute dyspnoea content domain. With regard to clinical reasoning, the selection of relevant tests, time required to make a diagnosis and accuracy of the diagnosis varied across the six case scenarios in both groups. However, the results from the measures of the clinical reasoning process did not differ between the students from the two types of undergraduate medical programmes. No significant differences were found with regard to the selection of relevant diagnostic tests (M = 63.8% vs. M = 62.8%), the time to a diagnosis (M = 128.7 s vs. M = 136.4 s) or the accuracy of diagnosis (M = 82.2% vs. M = 77.0%). Conclusions: Key indicators of the clinical reasoning process, when assessed with objectively measured parameters, did not differ between final-year medical students from a traditional, discipline-based and those from an integrated, competency-based undergraduate programme in the domain of acute dyspnoea. The results substantiate and expand those of previous studies based on subjective assessor ratings that showed limited change in the clinical reasoning performance of medical students with competency-based undergraduate education. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Prescribing (writing medication orders) is one of residents’ commonest tasks. Superficially, all they have to do is complete a form. Below this apparent simplicity, though, lies the complex task of framing patients’ needs and navigating relationships with them and other clinicians. Mistakes, which compromise patient safety, commonly result. There is no evidence that competence-based education is preventing harm. We found a profound contradiction between medical students becoming competent, as defined by passing competence assessments, and becoming capable of safely caring for patients. We reinstated patients as the object of learning by allowing students to ‘pre-prescribe’ (complete, but not authorise prescriptions). This turned a disabling tension into a driver of curriculum improvement. Students ‘knotworked’ within interprofessional teams to the benefit of patients as well as themselves. Refocusing undergraduate medical education on patient care showed promise as a way of improving patient safety. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Digitalized work has gained importance across industrialized countries. Simultaneously, research investigating the consequences of digitalized work for workplace relations among employees, supervisors, and coworkers, such as workplace bullying, is largely missing. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to investigate how digitalized work influences supervisory and coworker bullying dependent on individual, job, and workplace characteristics. We use representative linked-employer-employee data from 3612 employees located in 100 large workplaces in Germany across all industrial sectors and apply random effects multilevel linear analyses. Individual involvement in digitalized work is related to less supervisory bullying for all employees, and for lower qualified employees to less coworker bullying. At the workplace level, when digitalization has advanced, supervisory bullying increases for highly qualified employees. Neither the individual nor the workplace effects of digitalization are explained by mediating factors such as job autonomy, routine or machine work, competency, or psychological or physical stress. Competence and job autonomy prevent the occurrence of bullying, while routine work, psychological stress, and physically demanding work are positively related to bullying. All effects are more pronounced for supervisory bullying than for coworker bullying. Individual involvement with digitalized work seems to change relational dynamics within workplaces and to protect employees from bullying. For highly qualified employees, this is probably related to the gathering of key competencies; for lower qualified employees, it might be linked to working with digital devices. In workplaces where digitalization has progressed, digitalized work may disrupt and change the established work processes and relations and increase the necessity for new coordination and, thus, the occurrence of conflicts. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Sustainability science is an emerging, free-standing scientific discipline. It has introduced a new approach to both sustainability research and educational programmes, while evoking novel perspectives to stronger societal contextualization. Among several other areas of sustainability research, competencies for sustainability have become a focal topic of sustainability education research. This research explores the educational programmes and the representation of the theory-based key competencies for sustainability. Through a qualitative content study of 45 master programmes associated with sustainability science, we aim to understand what kind of sustainability competencies can be found in sustainability science master’s programmes and how they reflect the current discussions of the discipline of sustainability science and possibly drive the future education in the field. The study reveals that commonly suggested competencies including systems thinking, anticipatory, strategic, interpersonal, and normative competencies were frequently mentioned as content and learning outcomes in the curricula and are firmly present and widely employed in sustainability education. Additionally, this study identified three other clusters of competencies: diverse modes of thinking, methodological plurality, and competencies for autonomy. In addition to the contribution to education in the field by suggesting three emerged competencies for sustainability science specifically, we aim to contribute to the ongoing discussion about the discipline by suggesting a process-oriented framing of sustainability science. © 2019, The Author(s).

This study forms part of a wider investigation about the initiation of a training plan for protected youth in residential care in the community of Madrid: “Preparation Plan for Autonomous Living for 16-21 years old”. The present article takes place at the time of initiating intervention processes of the Plan for Autonomy within protection centres. This enables relevant information about the initial diagnosis of the situation to be considered alongside future scenarios of young people aged 16 years old. Method. To this end, a quantitative, descriptive and correlational analysis was carried out, and two questionnaires were developed: One directed towards young people and, another, towards education providers at the centres. 123 socio-educational professionals and 126 young people from 54 residential care facilities under the jurisdiction of the General Directorate of Family and Children in Madrid took part. Results. Results reflect the need to design educational policies which favour educational success of these young people and bring their educational level in line with that of their peers. Discussion and Conclusion. Likewise, it is imperative to offer educational support and adapt training programs towards participants so that they become fully trained and committed towards completing their studies. © 2021 Universidad de Almería and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (Spain).

AB  - Lesson planning is a crucial roadmap guiding the teacher before the implementation of the lesson. In the current study, we aimed at reviewing pedagogical documents used by Rwandan physics teachers. We gathered 32 lesson plans related to optics topics from five teachers and analyzed them using the lesson plan analysis protocol (LPAP) and lesson plan evaluation form (LPEF) jointly. We have found that teachers do not prepare these documents as required by the newly introduced competence-based curriculum. Teachers plan for low levels of Bloom's cognitive and affective taxonomy domains and do not follow effective inquiry techniques along the stages of the lesson activities. A detailed discussion on each teacher’s practice was provided, and we hope it can serve as a qualitative overview on teaching and learning planning for effective classroom implementation. Due to the importance of pedagogical documents on effective teaching, we went through a rigorous validation process and suggested a model lesson plan to be consulted by any physics teacher (please see Appendix C). We recommend that teachers consult this lesson plan and prepare accordingly before class. ©2020 The authors and IJLTER.ORG. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hundreds of sustainability programs have emerged at universities and colleges around the world over the past 2 decades. A prime question for employers, students, educators, and program administrators is what competencies these programs develop in students. This study explores convergence on competencies for sustainability programs. We conducted a Delphi study with 14 international experts in sustainability education on the framework of key competencies in sustainability by Wiek et al. (Sustain Sci 6: 203–218, 2011), the most frequently cited framework to date. While experts generally agreed with the framework, they propose two additional competencies, suggest a hierarchy of competencies, and specify learning objectives for students interested in a career as sustainability researcher. The refined framework can inform program development, implementation, and evaluation to enhance employability of graduates and facilitate comparison of sustainability programs worldwide. © 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The examination of pedagogies that promote effective sustainability learning has led to vigorous academic discussion, as has research regarding the role of competence-based learning for sustainability. This paper investigates the role of a study abroad program, the Engineers without Borders Design Summit, in promoting the acquisition of sustainability competencies in its students. This study analysed both content of the program pedagogy and the written learning reflections of 137 student participants to examine if the program resulted in sustainability competence acquisition. The study's findings suggested that students did acquire sustainability competencies during the program, but also that students may become competence-literate but context-lacking as they acquire competency skillsets without understanding their purpose for use as sustainability tools or to promote sustainability outcomes. Therefore, this study recommends that competence-based education for sustainability requires situation of competence acquisition within sustainability contextualisation to ensure full competence potential is fulfilled. This study suggests that contextualisation can occur in a number of ways, including the use of defined sustainability principles as boundary conditions to frame learning environments, the use of sustainability epistemic teachers as "guides" to connect learning to sustainability and the facilitation of student experiences with unsustainability to promote personally motivated action towards sustainability. © 2020 by the author.

AB  - Digital competency - which is indicated by the European Framework of Reference as one of the key competencies for Lifelong Learning - has been increasingly important in the international policy agenda as well as in the studies and academic publications. Taking into account that Adult Education mediated by a virtual environment may be an opportunity for knowledge acquisition and digital inclusion, there are, however, some contexts in which access, usage and participation are particularly obstructed or even precluded. Prisons are one of those contexts. Aiming to map trends in academic literature about Adult Learning supported by digital resources in prisons, we resorted to Education Source and ERIC databases to perform a literature review - published between 2010 and 2019 - and using the keywords prison, education, technology. The analysis of the 20 identified articles made it possible to know when and where they have emerged, as well as their objectives and the focus of the studies. With worldwide representation - although mainly European - and with particular expression in the last 5 years, the studies are mainly focused on prison education resources, learning results, educational staff and cultural aspects and policies. © 2021 UNIVERSIDADE FEEVALEÂ.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to explore an interdisciplinary pedagogical approach for advancing knowledge and understanding of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) at higher education institutions (HEIs). Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study conducted an explorative experiment to elaborate on forms to advance a pedagogical approach that embeds sustainability. The design of the pedagogical project was explorative and interdisciplinary, using a predefined framework on key competencies for sustainability. Findings: The findings showed that an interdisciplinary approach can create a learning setting that stimulates students’ problem-solving competencies for sustainability-related issues. Students were trained in the five key sustainable competencies addressed by Wiek et al. (2011). Moreover, although it is not always possible to arrange an interdisciplinary pedagogical setting, this might be a key condition for the development of students’ key competencies regarding their understanding of the SDGs. Addressing the SDGs from an interdisciplinary perspective paved the way for the development of students’ strategic competencies, including systems thinking and anticipatory competencies. Practical implications: The pedagogical project, as an interdisciplinary explorative experiment, was shown to be a potentially suitable method to counteract “cherry-picking” approaches to teaching the SDGs at HEI. Originality/value: The pedagogical approach advanced in this paper, extends active learning and interdisciplinarity in higher education. The authors argue that this approach encourages students to take ownership of and responsibility for their learning process and indicates a changed mindset and behavior. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This work presents the results of research whose main objective was to analyze the sources present in Geography and History textbooks used in Spain and Italy in secondary education, as well as how they were designed for use by the teaching staff of this subject. This research was carried out for the benefit of teachers and for the improvement of the teaching-learning process. The sample was configured on the basis of a rigorous analysis of textbooks belonging to relevant publishers in Spain and Italy, whose selection was made using a quantitative and descriptive research method based on the interpretative paradigm, with the help of an SPSS statistical program. As for the main results obtained, the data indicated that the tasks requested from students (based on the use or analysis of sources) are of a low cognitive level, which makes it difficult to learn critical and reflective historical thinking. Finally, it was concluded that for students to strengthen the development and acquisition of critical thinking, the use of textbooks must be integrated with other, more active resources and more participatory teaching strategies, putting both competency-based teaching and its assessment in quarantine. © 2021 The authors and IJLTER.ORG.

AB  - The purpose of the present paper is to present the most important aspects for competency-based education and training for both maritime and the Inland Waterways sector, to ensure that every student/trainee in the EU possesses the same competencies on operational level (OL) and management level (ML) after graduating from their study or training. To reach these goals, trainers need to be able to educate and train students in the competency based system, which serves two purposes: Defining minimum key competencies needed for crew members on board maritime and IWT vessels throughout the EU or worldwide, and thereby improving safety of navigation at sea and on the European interconnected waterways, and an increased level of labour mobility for crew members educated with the competencies as laid down in STCW 2010 and the new European directive. © 2020, Faculty of Navigation, Gdynia Maritime University.

AB  - This study examines whether online teacher professional development (OTPD), in the form of an interactive webinar series that encourages collaborative learning, improves student achievement. We conducted a randomised controlled trial with 1102 students, 45 teachers and 30 secondary schools in Flanders, Belgium. As a basis for the study, we developed a digital learning path aimed at improving student scores on financial literacy–a multidimensional key competence recently integrated into the curriculum. We demonstrate that the learning path improves student learning outcomes and that enhanced teacher involvement in this programme does not increase learning outcomes unless the teachers participate in the OTPD initiative. Teacher engagement in the webinar series generated student learning outcomes 0.39 standard deviations higher than those of students whose teachers did not receive this intervention, thus, confirming the effectiveness of the OTPD initiative. This effect was found immediately after programme implementation, and it persisted until at least 6 weeks later. As an underlying mechanism, we observe that engagement in the webinar series enhances teachers' self-efficacy. Classroom observations suggest that engagement increases the frequency of providing students with content-related help. © 2020 British Educational Research Association

AB  - Secondary education curricula highlight competence-based learning; although meaningful school-intervention habits have not yet been observed. The initiatives implemented have focused primarily on promoting the combined development of no more than three key competences. This article presents an international study under the Erasmus+ and H2020 programmes, for analysing the impact of the STEAM project-based learning approach with KIKS format (Kids Inspire Kids for STEAM) on the interwoven development of key competences. The sample included 267 high school students divided into53teams from29 educational centres in Finland, England, Hungary, and Spain. Each team carried out several projects for no less than two academic years, by means of the following two approaches: STEAM project-based learning and KIKS. Data were collected from observations and interviews with students, teachers, and KIKS trainers. Analyses revealed that the combination of these two approaches facilitate the development of all eight key competences. The project-based learning focus essentially fostered the enhancement of the mathematical competence and in science, technology, and engineering, while KIKS format promoted literacy and multilingual competences. The remaining competences were encouraged by the combination of both approaches. It is noteworthy that prolonged participation in the programme, as it was implemented, was crucial to achieving the obtained outcomes. © 2021, Revista Científica de Educomunicación.

AB  - Purpose: This article aims to conduct a critical analysis of key-competences-based education in China today by revealing three main challenges that Chinese educational practitioners, researchers, and policymakers might face. Design/Approach/Methods: Against the backdrop of international and Chinese policy and the practice of key-competences-based education, this article focuses on a critical discourse analysis of this educational movement in China. Findings: China places great emphasis on the personal, cultural, and moral dimensions in generating a framework of competences, paying considerable attention to the well-being of children; hence it currently endeavors to provide a consistent educational framework to educate the young for the all-round development. However, three challenges are salient: the dilemma between Core-Suyang (Core-Competence) and the education for all-round development of the young, the limitations of design of “subject core-competences,” and a lack of consideration of subjectification as purpose of education. Originality/Value: Education which merely focuses on a list of key-competences might not only exclude non-key-competences but also exclude something unforeseen and unknown in the process of educational adventure. It is therefore suggested that a holistic education needs to be engaged in with an encompassing and dynamic view of purpose(s) of education, in which the education for subjectification is at stake in our educational endeavor. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Objective: This paper has attempted to explore factors which should be considered in designing a sexuality education package for severe mental illness. Method: Twenty-one in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted in one of the psychiatric hospitals in Tehran. All participants were selected by purposive sampling. Interviews continued until data were saturated. Using conventional qualitative content analysis, data reduction was done by MAXQDA 10 software. Findings: Qualitative interview analysis revealed 222 codes which are summarized in 15 subcategories and 3 categories including “key competences must be created”, “Educational package features” and “Educational Organization”. Conclusion: Sexual package should provide necessary information, improve risk perception and motivate learning of sexual issues in these patients. Also, providing an appropriate educational package should be concise, ordered and comprehensive. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Project Portfolio Management (PPM) is becoming a key competence for companies handling numerous projects simultaneously. PPM instructors have been largely unable to transform what is being taught into applicable skills. Gamification has been successfully applied in some educational environments and it has been increasingly applied in Management university courses. The objective of this study is to propose and assess a gamified strategy for teaching Project Portfolio Management to MBA students. The implementation of this gamified experience was carried out in 2018, 2019 and 2020 with 122 students. They were quite satisfied with the gamified experience and recognized that the Portfolio Game Experience contributed to learning different PPM techniques and processes, especially those associated with project prioritization and selection. Moreover, 100% of the respondents would recommend the course to a colleague. By qualitatively analyzing students’ feedback, this study has found out that the Portfolio Game Experience provided the students the practical experience of actively learning what they have seen in theory. Students also highlighted typical game characteristics that contribute to their learning, like the fact that the game is fun, challenging, motivating and interactive. When compared to other courses they have taken so far, students evaluate this experience as superior. © 2020

AB  - Aim/Purpose This paper, although conceived earlier than the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic, addresses the problem of informing agility as part of organizational agility that has become a rather important issue for business survival. Background While the general issues of business informing, and business intelligence (BI) in particular, have been widely researched, the dynamics of informing, their ability to act in accord with changes in business and preserve the key competencies has not been widely researched. In particular, the research on BI agility is rather scattered, and many issues need to be clarified. Methodology A series of in-depth interviews with BI professionals to determine relations between organizational agility and BI agility, and to round up a set of key factors of BI agility. Contribution The paper clarifies a candidate set of key factors of BI agility and gives ground for future research in relations with areas like corporate and BI resilience and culture. Findings The interview results show the relations between organizational changes, and changes in BI activities. BI has limited potential in recognizing important external changes but can be rather helpful in making decision choices and detecting internal problems. Lack of communication between business and IT people, existence of data silos and shadow BI, and general inadequacy of organizational and BI culture are the key factors impairing BI agility. Recommendations There are practical issues around BI agility that need solving, like the reason-for Practitioners able coverage of standards or creation of a dedicated unit to care about BI potential. Recommendations The research is still in its starting phase, but additional interesting directions for Researchers start to emerge, like relations between BI agility, resilience and corporate agil ity, or the role of informing culture and BI culture for BI agility issues. Impact on Society Agile business, especially in times of global shocks like COVID-19, loses less value and has more chances to survive. Future Research Most likely this will be focused on the relations between BI agility, resilience, and corporate agility, and the role of informing culture and BI culture for BI agility issues. © 2021.

AB  - This article examined perceptions on curriculum implementation regarding rural Zimbabwean early childhood development (ECD) teachers in 2017. The study aimed to locate teachers as agents of change in schools by reviewing their perceptions in implementing the recently introduced ECD framework. In this qualitative multiple case study, 30 rural teachers from Zimbabwe’s 10 provinces shared their views as well as strengths and weaknesses of the competence-based curriculum. Implicit in the teachers’ descriptions of effective curriculum implementation were their perspectives on effective classroom instruction. Such perspectives offer much insight into challenges experienced in curriculum implementation for rural schools. Using teacher agency as a theoretical framework, findings of the study revealed that teachers lack support regarding proper infrastructural facilities, and schools lack human, financial, and material resources for successful curriculum implementation. The researcher recommends that as a basis for future policy, the concerns of teachers, parents, and learners in complex ECD settings need to be highly prioritized by the curriculum makers ahead of planning and implementing a new curriculum. © 2020 Childhood Education International.

AB  - Background: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is considered a key competence for practicing high-quality and safe nursing. However, undergraduate nursing programs continue to provide traditional classroom teaching strategies that have limitations in facilitating the development of critical competences for engaging in EBP in real clinical contexts. Objective and design: The purpose of this study was to develop a web-based experiential learning program aimed at improving the engagement and experience of nursing students in EBP. A quasi-experimental research with non-equivalent control-group with non-synchronized design was used to describe the process of program development and the innovative learning method, and discuss the outcomes of the program. Methods: The experimental group was exposed to a web-based experiential learning program, while the control group received traditional learning with written material. Self-reported EBP scores (knowledge and skills, attitude, and practice) and clinical-questioning confidence were evaluated to assess the effects of the program. Results: The result showed that web-based experiential learning strategies were effective in significantly improving the EBP knowledge and skills score (F = 12.29, p = .001) and the score for confidence in asking clinical questions (F = 12.14, p = .001). The attitudes toward EBP (F = 0.75, p = .389) and practice score (F = 3.22, p = .076) did not show a significant difference between the experimental group and the control group. Conclusion: The web-based experiential learning was found to be an effective method for enhancing the EBP competence of nursing students. Based on the study results, we suggest using web-based experiential learning to supplement the traditional learning method or as the mainstream learning method for nursing students. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - -Identify the existing opportunities and challenges for the education of refugee children-Citizenship and civic education of refugee children is seen as an asset to reduce inequality for their future livelihoods-What significant initiatives were launched to support refugee children in developing key competence-Explores how to respond more creatively and collaboratively to support the refugee children education in this critical situation-How governmental and non-governmental organizations are willing to support their education process Purpose: The number of Rohingya refugee children in Bangladesh is more than fifty percent who are out of formal education since the persecution and the mass atrocities which started in 2017 by the Myanmar government in Rakhine. They need education as their rights and means of future livelihoods that can contribute to both the refugee and host society in the future. Thus, perceptions into formal education can help refugee children to reduce inequality in general and build capacity from a socio-economic and moral perspective. Methodology: The article endeavors to document the existing pros and cons of Rohingya refugee children's education in Bangladesh. Therefore, the study offers insights examining the existing framework of education for citizenship and civic education of refugee children as well as the opportunities in the future in terms of quality, quantity, and level of education. In direction to investigate the education process in the context of refugee children the study primarily based on secondary sources of data to grasp the conclusion. Findings: The results indicate that limited initiative has been taken by the host country and other supporting regional and global non-state actors for Rohingya refugee children. However, the number of education centers need to increase immediately as many more children are out of formal education. In addition, it is crucial to start a junior schooling system for teenagers as well as recruit trained and efficient teachers with a structured curriculum. Furthermore, the government of Bangladesh is adamant to open a formal education system, though the international partners are continuously urging for it which is also crucial for education and citizenship education with a well-structured curriculum. The teachers and students need additional support in terms of training and motivation to keep the process ongoing which is found more challenging for both of them while the host country’s schooling shutdown since March 2020. Limitations: Findings of this study on refugee children's education in Bangladesh cannot be generalized to another context. © 2021, sowi-online e.V.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: The ability of health care professionals to measure change is critical for successful quality improvement (QI) efforts. Currently, there are no systematic reviews focusing on continuing education for health care professionals in data skills for QI. The purpose of this systematic review is to define effectiveness and sustainability of QI programs for health care professionals containing a measurement skills component and to identify barriers and facilitators to effectiveness and sustainability. Methods: The systematic review involved study identification, screening, full text review, and data extraction. Four electronics databases and grey literature sources were searched to identify studies published between 2009 and 2019 (11 years). A customized data extraction form was developed. Mixed methods appraisal tool was used for quality assessment and a thematic analysis was conducted for narrative synthesis. Results: Fifty-three studies from 11 countries were included. Most study designs were quantitative descriptive (17/53) and used a blended learning approach (25/53) combining face-to face and distance learning modes. The programs included basic, intermediate, and advanced data skills concepts. Overall, studies reported positive outcomes for participant reaction, learning, and behavior, but reported variable success in sustainability and spread of QI. Discussion: Studies discussed measurement as a key competency for clinical QI. Effectiveness definitions focused on the short-term impact of the programs, whereas sustainability definitions emphasized maintenance of outcomes and skills in the long-term. Factors that influenced effectiveness and sustainability of the included studies were strategic approach to QI, organizational support, intervention design, communication, accountability, leadership support, and learning networks.

AB  - The imminent digitalisation of education in Romania is described and announced by the "Strategy on the digitalisation of education in Romania" (document in public consultation). This will bring a number of updates to primary education but, to analyze this transition, this paper sets out why the focus on digital education is needed, what will be left behind by the future update in the primary education curriculum and the prospects for updating it. The analysis of the actual curriculum indicates that only two of the competences specific to all subjects in primary education tangentially support the development of digital competence. This analysis was carried out under the common terminology used in definitions of digital competence extracted from European education policies as well as common reference tools at European and national level. For a more accurate correlation of the curricular projection with the targeted key competence were analyzed, based on the same terminology, even the learning activities suggested by school curricula, finding a low proportion of integration of digital competences in teaching. Therefore, tomorrow's school projections viewed through the "Strategy on the digitalisation of education in Romania", in relation to the data of this paper, are welcome. © 2021 Transilvanian Association for the Literarure and Culture of Romanian People (ASTRA).

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore what key competencies and characteristics of teachers are needed for integrated Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) teaching and to investigate teachers’ perceptions on how important those competencies are and how often they are executed. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory sequential mixed methods approach was used to investigate key characteristics of integrated STEM teaching competencies and the level of their importance and performance as perceived by teachers. By using behavioral event interview technique, qualitative data were collected from professional secondary teachers in science, math and technology subjects. An instrument was constructed based on the result of qualitative research; and a survey was conducted with 48 STEM teachers working in South Korea. The mean values between importance and performance of integrated STEM teaching competencies were compared. A perceived importance level of each item was compared with a practice level by using importance-performance analysis. Findings: As a result of qualitative research, in total 21 items were constructed as detailed characteristics of each domain of integrated STEM teaching competencies, which provide insights about teachers’ perceptions of teaching competencies that are critical for integrated STEM education. A comparison of means between importance and performance of integrated STEM teaching competencies showed that whereas teachers considered each of these items to be of significant importance in their overall evaluation of the integrated STEM teaching competencies, they are not performing at a level that reflects the assigned importance. Practical implications: This research results provide information for future research on how to implement an integrated STEM education initiative at the secondary school level, for planning teacher training programs, pre-service teacher education and related educational policies. Originality/value: South Korea has focused on integrated STEM education to raise talented human resources in the fields of science and technology. However, many teachers have experienced serious difficulties and troubles in executing integrated STEM education. It is necessary to figure out key competencies and characteristics of teachers to facilitate integrated STEM teaching. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Cross-border cooperation within the framework of the Carpathian Euroregion provides the possibility of building the processes of education at universities that would facilitate knowledge transfer from the universities to the business sphere, which is particularly significant in terms of forming innovations. The aim of the research conducted was the analysis of the key competences that have an impact on the level of innovativeness of the graduates of the universities of a business profile in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Romania. In the methodology used, a systematic literary review of the acquired references from the databases of ProQuest, Emerald, SCOPUS, and the Jagiellonian Library was applied from the outset. Subsequently, a small number of foreign and Polish research works conducted in the sphere of the stipulated subject matter of the competences of graduates, as well as their innovativeness were identified and ascertained. This facilitated the specification of the cognitive gaps as follows: There was no prior research relating to the Carpathian Euroregion and the transnational cooperation, with particular consideration given to the role of graduates of universities in terms of shaping change in this area. In empirical research, a survey method was chosen as it enabled, among other things, the quantitative description of specific aspects declared as the competences of graduates in the chosen research group. The research conducted reveals that there are no stipulated ways of ranking the essential competences directed at innovativeness, thus the decision-makers at the universities in the Carpathian Euroregion must consider what way and what activities they may use to connect the development of competences. The results acquired and the conclusions drawn may serve the transfer and adoption of good practices from individual countries and regions to other European and non-European ones. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Dual-process theories may be invoked to explain how physicians interact with, interpret, and draw inferences from clinical information. Stanovich and West’s model articulates two kinds of thinking-intuitive-based System 1 and analytical-based System 2-which have been under-investigated with physicians in training. This qualitative study explored pre-clerkship medical students’ retrospective perspectives and experiences of System 1 and System 2 thinking via 12 semi-structured interviews and abductive, progressive focusing. Participants identified patient interactions, clinical note writing, knowledge synthesis, problem list and differential diagnosis generation, evaluating evidence, and critical appraisal of literature as pre-clerkship opportunities to engage in System 1 or System 2 thinking. Six major themes emerged from analysis of participants’ interview transcripts: cognitive processes, deliberate practice, learning environment: being alone or being together, stickiness factor, biases and heuristics, and prior experience of attaining competence. Participants valued the anticipated role that System 1 and System 2 thinking will play in their future practice, and experienced nascent, self-regulated development of these cognitive processes during the pre-clerkship phase of their education without formal feedback or coaching from clinician preceptors. Pre-clerkship curricula should further embrace low-stakes, incremental teaching on metacognition and continuous monitoring of knowledge processing as a key competency for physician learners. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This work describes a two-year project carried out in an Italian technical high school. Through integrated work, the activity involved the efforts of different teachers and students, particularly those in the Chemical, Electronic, and IT departments. They merged their complementary skills to create an inexpensive device that quickly measures water hardness. The pedagogical aspect of this work aimed to support and reinforce development of the key competences for lifelong learning recommended by the European Commission, especially by strengthening the logical-mathematical, digital, and social skills of the students. The device made is based on an Arduino board connected to a red LED and an optical sensor. The device is able to read the intensity of light transmitted through the sample and to independently convert this output into the water hardness expressed in French degrees. The color change used as information transducer is due to the aggregation of negative gold nanoparticles induced by the bivalent cations in solution. Working in school laboratories under teacher supervision, students connected and troubleshot the hardware system, synthesized and characterized the gold nanoparticles, and developed the software. Finally, the system was assembled inside a box composed of a rigid container, a sample holder, and a touchscreen display. Instructions for replicating this instrument are reported in the paper, while further details and explanations for instructors and students are provided in the Supporting Information.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine Spanish teachers' perceptions about the competence-based curriculum model (CBCM) introduced by LOE (2006) and maintained by later legislation, ten years after its deployment. Participants were 1408 Spanish Primary and Secondary School teachers (719 women and 689 men). Participants answered an ad hoc questionnaire consisting of a 23-item, five-factor scale (beliefs about the theoretical model, level of implementation of the model, difficulties in implementing the model, resources, and professional development). The questionnaire was sent through an on-line application to all Spanish Primary and Secondary Schools. The results show that teachers perceive the importance of curricular change although their expectations are negative regarding its implementation in classrooms. They are committed to the application of the CBCM but there is still a great demand for training and contextual conditions need to be improved. Regarding the factors analyzed, women have a better consideration of the degree of application of teaching strategies or the uniformity in the implementation of CBCM, while men score significantly higher in available resources. Primary school teachers have a more favorable perception in most of the items than secondary school teachers. It is necessary to address all these difficulties observed by teachers if educational reforms are intended to have a real impact on the results of the educational process. © 2020 Grupo de Investigacion FORCE.

AB  - Background: Eswatini is facing a critical shortage of human resources for health (HRH) and limited access to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment in rural areas. This study assessed multiple stakeholders’ perceptions of task-shifting directly observed treatment (DOT) supervision and administration of intramuscular MDR-TB injections to lay health workers (LHWs). Methods: A mixed methods study comprising a cross-sectional survey using a semi-structured questionnaire with community treatment supporters (CTSs) and a focus group discussion with key stakeholders including representatives from the Eswatini Ministry of Health (MOH), donor organisations, professional regulatory institutions, nursing academia, civil society and healthcare providers was conducted in May 2017. Descriptive statistics, thematic content analysis and data triangulation aided in the interpretation of results. Results: A large majority of CTSs (n = 78; 95.1%) were female and 33 (40.2%) were older than 50 years. Most (n = 7; 70.0%) key stakeholders had over 10 years of work experience in policy-making, advocacy in the fields of HRH or day-to-day practice in MDR-TB management. Task-shifting of MDR-TB injection administration was implemented without national policy guidance and regulation. Stakeholders viewed the strategy to be driven by the prevailing shortage of professional frontline HRH and limited access to MDR-TB treatment. Task-shifting was perceived to improve medication adherence, and reduce stigma and transport-related MDR-TB treatment access barriers. Frontline healthcare workers and implementing donor partners fully supported task-shifting. Policy-makers and other stakeholders accepted task-shifting conditionally due to fears of poor standards of care related to perceived incompetence of CTSs. Appropriate compensation, adequate training and supervision, and non-financial incentives were suggested to retain CTSs. A holistic task-shifting policy and collaboration between the MOH, academia and nursing council in regulating the practice were recommended. Conclusions: Stakeholders generally accepted the delegation of DOT supervision and administration of intramuscular MDR-TB injections to LHWs as a strategy to increase access to treatment, albeit with some apprehension. Findings from this study stress that task-shifting is not a panacea for HRH shortages, but a short-term solution that must form part of an overall simultaneous strategy to train, attract and retain adequate numbers of professional healthcare workers in Eswatini. To address some of the apprehension and ambivalence about expanding access to MDR-TB services through task-shifting, attention should be paid to important aspects such as competence-based training, certification and accreditation, adequate supportive on-the-job supervision, recognition, compensation, and expediting policy and regulatory support for LHWs. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The progress and popularization of the mobile Internet herald the age of Internet plus education. With the deepening of education reform, China raises new requirements on the key competencies of students. Focusing on the cultivation of these competencies, this paper develops an innovative method for digital media education based on mobile Internet technology. After surveying the current learning state of students majoring in digital media, the authors proposed a blended teaching model with digital media based on mobile Internet technology. There are four parts of the model, namely, frontend analysis, online autonomous learning, offline teaching, and after-class online evaluation. The design of each part was described in details. Then, the proposed model was applied to the Poster Design course of digital media major. Comparative analysis shows that the model promotes students’ learning efficiency, and their key competencies, and receives high recognition from the students. This research provides new impetus to the innovation of digital media education based on mobile Internet technology. © 2021, International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning.

AB  - Data analysis skills are key competencies which today’s students in higher education must acquire. Among non-cognitive factors hindering the acquisition of these competencies are negative attitudes towards Statistics. This study analyzes attitudes towards Statistics among tourism students enrolled on their first Statistics course, paying special attention to its evolution from the beginning to the end of the course. Positive attitudes are a desirable course result, and its development needs to be assessed. An exploratory factor analysis performed on the SATS-28© items reveals the existence of three main components of students’ attitudes towards Statistics: Anxiety, Affect & Self-confidence, and Value. At the end of the course, only the Anxiety dimension improved its score. Since there is an absolute lack of research on tourism students’ attitudes towards Statistics, it would be advisable to carry out further research, extending the preliminary methodology presented in this research to other courses, universities, and countries. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Successfully developing a new product, service, or production process for commercial purposes involves complex and dynamic changes, and therefore requires an organizational climate that fosters innovation. In this sense, the means by which knowledge is created and exploited in the firm constitute its key competence and the source of its innovation capabilities. The research objective was to establish the relationship between organizational climate and innovation capability. The sample consisted of 102 Colombian new technology-based firms. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and PLSpredict were used for the statistical analysis. The results indicate that the organizational climate positively and directly influences the innovation capability (organizational ambidexterity, exploration, and exploitation). The findings obtained will help firms, especially those that require a lot of knowledge and carry out their activities in dynamic environments, to understand how organizational climate influences innovation capability, which is understood through the dimensions of exploration, exploitation, and organizational ambidexterity. This will provide new technology-based firms with a higher capacity to adapt to the conditions of uncertainty and complexity of the environment. © 2020 by the author.

AB  - Key competencies straddle an educational reform that has taken on a central role within the European Union. However, there is a lack of empirical instruments aimed at assessing preservice teachers’ opinion of competency-based policies, their self-evaluation regarding such policies, and their understanding of the intended rationale behind competency mandates. Instruments with similar aims in other contexts suffer psychometric shortcomings. Therefore, the authors’ aim was to design an instrument to examine primary preservice teachers’ beliefs about the role of key competencies in education, self-evaluate their understanding of the concept of key competencies, and determine if they understood the intended interdisciplinary focus. A three-phase pilot (n = 295, n = 277, n = 263) was carried out with each phase aimed at progressively improving the instrument’s psychometric soundness. Drawing from data obtained from the third pilot, the psychometric scale properties are reported for a much-needed assessment tool. © 2021 Teacher Development.

AB  - The multidimensional character of competence development involves a profound methodological change in how the teaching process is conceived. An integrated STEAM education is one potentially useful methodological approach to assist in this matter. Using design research, an integrated STEAM approach was designed, implemented and assessed with 121 students in their sixth year of primary education. Its effect was analysed through a mixed methods study. The results show that the students obtain a high level of competence after the approach is applied in all of the key competences, with an emphasis on the level attained by girls in scientific skills. These results seem to reinforce the hypothesis that an integrated STEAM education is effective as a possible avenue for improving competence development in the primary education years as it didactically responds to the complexity of today’s world. © 2021 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.

AB  - This study adopted the modified Delphi method to build key competence indicators for the course subject ‘Environment’ in the secondary school curriculum in South Korea. 15 Delphi panelists participated, and were provided a three-stage questionnaire survey. The findings classified eight secondary school ‘environment’ curriculum key competencies into three domains: intellect-oriented, personality-oriented, and relationship-oriented. The intellect-oriented domain includes ‘critical-thinking ability,’ ‘creativity,’ and ‘problem-solving ability’; the personality-oriented domain includes ‘autonomy,’ ‘ability to reflect,’ and ‘environmental sensitivity’; and the relationship-oriented domain includes ‘communication ability’ and ‘ability to manage conflicts.’ These environmental competencies were utilized to revise the current environmental education curriculum as part of the 2015 revision of the National Curriculum and set the key competencies for environment classes. The paper concludes with the significance of developments in theorizing and implementing environmental education curriculums in Korea and abroad. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Kosovo introduced two major curriculum reforms over the past 20 years–in 2001 and 2011–each aiming to bring education closer to international trends. Simultaneously, Kosovo underwent major political, social, and cultural changes after the war in 1999, and the declaration of independence in 2008. This article relies on document analysis and uses civic competences definitions in Kosovo and European Commission frameworks to compare conceptions of citizenship for democratic life along three theoretical constructs, namely personally responsible/individualist, participatory/social, and justice-oriented/political. It coins loud borrowing to describe the policy flow into Kosovo education, specifically focusing on the latest 2011 competence-based curriculum reform. The findings show that Kosovo’s curriculum alignment with the European Commission key competence approach in 2011 served larger political goals and aspirations to brand Kosovars as ‘Young Europeans.’ In addition, personally responsible/individualist conception and participatory/social conception of citizenship are dominant in Kosovo, as well as in European Commission frameworks. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - (1) Background: Presently, sustainability is a crucial issue for human beings due to many disasters owing to climate change. Information Technology (IT) is now part of everyday life in society due to the proliferation of gadgets such as mobile phones, apps, computers, information systems, web-based systems, etc. (2) Methods: The analysis is based on recent ACM/IEEE curriculum guidelines for IT, a rigorous literature review as well as various viewpoints and their relevance for sustainability-oriented curriculum development; it also includes an assessment of key competencies in sustainability for proposed units in the IT curriculum. (3) Results: Sustainability is a critical subject for prospective IT professionals. Therefore, it is imperative to motivate and raise awareness among students and the faculty community regarding sustainability through its inclusion in the Informatics curriculum. This paper focuses on how sustainability can be included in various courses of the Informatics curriculum. It also considers recent ACM/IEEE curriculum guidelines for IT professionals, which assert that IT students should explore IT strategies required for developing a culture of green and sustainable IT. (4) Conclusions: This paper provides guidelines for IT curriculum development by incorporating sustainable elements in courses, so that future IT professionals can learn and practice sustainability in order to develop a sustainable society. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The objective of this research was two-fold. First, to determine the impact of a Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Education program on school performance amongst primary education students. Second, to identify the potential benefits of this program on the key competences of university students in Primary Education Teacher Training. The primary education students' sub-sample, after being matched on key covariates, was randomly assigned either to the experimental (N = 25) or control group (N = 25). The university students' sub-sample consisted of 26 students self-selected from the Primary Education Teacher Training degree. The intervention consisted of 20 two-hour weekly sessions of highly structured after-school tutoring delivered by previously trained university students. Although statistical significance was not reached for the hypotheses tested, notably, the results showed between small and moderate effect sizes (i.e., magnitude and direction of the program impact) for primary education students on core STEM subjects (e.g., mathematics d = 0.29, natural science d = 0.26), and for university students on some key employability competencies (e.g., action orientation d = 0.27 or team orientation d = 0.54). © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In this paper we explore the perception that industrial organization engineering students had after facing a compulsory, long-duration practicum oriented to develop key professional skills as management, analysis, diagnosis, resolution and organization of production and management and business administration in real professional environments. Specifically, we seek to explore the competencies and input provided to these students during their training stage as an Air Control and Defense Officer at the Spanish Air Force. In this case, the degree syllabus was designed so that the students could acquire the competencies related to industrial engineering, telecommunications, electronics or management linked to this profession. The study was based on the 141 students' feedback as well as the assessment by the professional mentors and the academic faculty. Results revealed that transversal competencies (also known as cross-curricular or soft competencies) are crucial. According to students' perceptions, competencies related to problem solving, team integration, communication and management play a major role for them to become successful in the practicum. In addition, 92% of these students held the view that the competencies acquired during the degree subjects helped them to finish the practicum satisfactorily. They valued the new knowledge and aptitudes they received during the process.  © 2021 TEMPUS Publications.

AB  - Field placement is considered a core component of social work education. However, it requires regular personal contacts with individuals, groups and communities. These contacts have been limited in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. A central question is how to organize field placement during the lockdown to develop key competencies in social work. To answer this question, we employ the students’ reports, competency-based self-evaluation tools, students’ assessment of the field placement (led by the University’s education quality assurance centre) and assessment of students’ performance by the field placement supervisors and university instructors. This paper presents the achievements and challenges of teaching and mastering key competencies in social work at the School of Social Work of the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy from different perspectives: students, placement agencies and the University itself. While almost all competencies have been taught and learned, those related to individual casework were the most difficult to achieve. The flexibility of the social work profession is also discussed in this paper. Future social workers should be flexible and meet the people’s needs in different contexts, including lockdown. The findings have implications for students, schools of social work and field placement agencies. © 2021

AB  - In order to prepare Rwandan citizens for a competitive world, a competence-based curriculum (CBC) has been implemented since 2016. The problem addressed by this study is “under which conditions will the implementation of the intended science curriculum be realised in classroom”. Framed by the Rogan and Grayson theory of curriculum implementation, a multiple case study was conducted to explore the relationships between a school’s profile of science CBC implementation and its capacity to support innovation. This was done by interviewing 12 teachers, observing and recording 23 of their science lessons, and surveying school facilities in their three schools. The data were presented in narrative form based on ratings (1–4) of lessons and schools’ capacity to innovate. Despite the variations between teachers and schools in CBC implementation caused by differences in individual professional development and schools’ capacity to innovate, the results revealed high levels of appropriate CBC implementation in aspects of classroom interactions, teaching and learning activities, and assessment. On the other hand, a low implementation level was noticed in the aspect of science-in-society. The study findings relate the profile of science CBC implementation to some aspects of a school’s capacity to innovate, particularly individual teacher’s experience, inadequate preparedness to enact CBC and inadequate teaching and learning resources for science. For successful implementation of science CBC, strong and regular training programmes that focus on how the new ideas are put into practice, together with the provision of teaching and learning resources for science, are recommended. © 2021 Southern African Association for Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education (SAARMSTE).

AB  - Much has been written about service user involvement in social work education with the literature recognizing the value of this particular type of experiential knowledge in helping students understand key competences and concepts. There is also extensive literature highlighting the role of simulation in assisting social work students to develop key insights in regard to skills and knowledge through role-plays. Using a Cross-Over design, this paper compares the contribution of drama students with service users in the preparation of social work students for field practice in Northern Ireland. Our findings suggest there is an important role for both drama students and service users working collaboratively to help social work students develop in key areas of social work competence and have implications for social work education in an international context. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study’s aim is to determine the consistency of student opinions regarding the importance of individual skills in three areas—people, practice, and perspective—with expert assessment. The study group consisted of five-year students accredited by IPMA Poland. The team of experts was comprised of recruiters, project management lecturers, assessors, and information technology (IT) industry project managers. Our research shows divergences in the approach to key competence that a project manager should have. This is understandable, given the specifics of the comparison. However, the analysis that has been conducted and presented will allow the curricula to be revised. The subsequent evaluation of curricula should address the changes in the labor market. Education should provide key competences, especially as modern project management requires a full spectrum of competences and approaches. Besides experience, project management is the most frequently pursued competence that is required in terms of staff recruitment criteria. The research resulting figures may be useful for recruiters, certification institutions, and universities. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Despite the accelerated dynamics of the environment, higher education institutions slowly update their curricula in entrepreneurship education according to global challenges and market needs. Moreover, knowledge and good practice exchange between educators of futures studies, business representatives and academics is limited. This article aims to present the methodology of prototyping an online course for individuals to become more future-oriented in their professional and personal settings. The main research problems tackled by the authors relate to: 1) identification of competences that would help academics, entrepreneurs and students to deal with uncertainty and to 2) convey the competences to the target groups through learning topics selected from futures studies and the entrepreneurship repertoire. The authors of the article undertook and coordinated theoretical and empirical research on foresight and Futures Literacy and its correspondence with entrepreneurship within the beFORE project funded under the Erasmus+ programme Knowledge Alliance scheme. The research process resulted in identification of 12 key competence items and development of the free approximately 34 hours long online course consisting of seven self-standing modules, 25 lessons and 79 learning topics corresponding to these competences. The originality of the paper is in its contribution to the discussion on the competences and online course contents that efficiently increase the capacities of using the future(s) in professional, academic and personal settings. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This qualitative study examines the changes introduced in curriculum policy in Kosovo in the latest curriculum reform of 2011. Framed by curriculum and didaktik education traditions theoretically, the findings reveal that introduction of key competences and associated learning outcomes in 2011 marked the most substantial departure from the previously content-based curriculum policy in place. It is concluded that European education trends provided the macro narrative and legitimation for the 2011 competence-based curriculum reform in Kosovo. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Skills in using information and communication technology solutions in the modern world determine the quality of professional and social life for everyone. The last decade has shown that digital competences are an important group of key competences for every employee and every organization. The purpose of this study is to present results of surveys on digital competences of Polish and Slovak students. Generally, results show that assessment of the level of digital competence of Polish students is not only higher but also less diverse. The rationale for addressing the subject of digital competences is its significance, constant changes resulting from development of ICT and the need to improve quality of life of individuals and organizations in the modern digital world. In this questionnaire, the students were asked to evaluate their level of understanding both existing and non-existing terms from the ICT area. The results have shown that there are significant differences between the questioned groups of students especially in case of IT competences. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - One of the main aims of diverse education systems is the development of key competences to improve citizens’ capacity for lifelong learning. However, some authors have signalled the challenge their measurement entails, among them the Learning to Learn (LtL) competence, which has also been shown to be complex to define and is under research. With a pre–post-test design and a variety of assessment instruments, this study compares the effect having an educational technology course and using telecollaboration has on the development of the LtL competence in a content and language integrated (CLIL) learning environment. Four groups of teacher trainees at two different universities took initial and after treatment surveys on LtL. Quantitative and qualitative data analysis indicated that technology boosts LtL but that telecollaboration helps develop LtL reflective concepts further in the form of processes by constructing or accomplishing learning goals in similar contexts. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Present perceptions about the poor production of university students in the last decades might be the same other professors had in previous centuries. Nonetheless, more corseting forms of assessment and the irruption of new technologies can establish a difference. These factors serve the controversy when blamed for preventing intellectual development, or when also considering that ICTs are the personal mark of new generations of youths who face their outdated dinosaur teachers. The purpose of this paper is to provide a tentative case analysis of the situation to validate what seems a generalized perception of the decay of tertiary education. Our data will be obtained from answers that students of the third year of a Humanities English degree could not provide. In our approach we will consider the difficulties students have in reaching the highest levels of taxonomies like Bloom’s (1956) or Dreyfus & Dreyfus (1980) with their further modifications. Collaterally we will tackle key competences and forms of assessment. Results induce us to the dichotomy of maintaining the present progression or, alternatively, encouraging all to think again and take some action. © 2021, Universitat Jaume I. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objectives of the study, as presented in the introductory part, are to lay out the employment specifics in the Czech Republic in continuity with the level of higher education as perceived from the perspective of the educational structure oriented at university graduates; still the riskiest group in the labor market. Thus, what remains the center of attention is the necessity of professional preparation of university students in terms of key competencies in continuity with sufficient experience to ensure their success in the labor market. The primary objective of this study is also aimed at addressing the current situation. The Introduction points at the current level of the Czech labor market with the focus on regional specification in connection with the Czech state tertiary education, and this part is followed by introducing possible solutions to the current situation, based on the quantitative data research conducted over three years by students of the Faculty of Multimedia Communications at Tomas Bata University in Zlin on one side. On the other hand, the survey also included nonprofit organizations with one common goal; the development of key competencies in continuity with the requirements of nonprofit entities in the output stemming from experience, reflecting within the academia and the nonprofit sector to support the development and possible future career orientation in marketing communication activities. © 2020

AB  - The third sector represents a vast and heterogeneous universe that has a key role in society from both the social and civil points of view. It also represents an informal learning context where competence and knowledge are acquired, often in a tacit and indirect way. This research focuses on the key competences of the third sector professionals and on the pedagogical methods to make them visible and to encourage their recognition. The quantitative and qualitative data sources include: questionnaires, focus groups, and diaries. The results show that the informal learning of key competences by professionals is a primary result of their activities that should be given greater visibility. Six areas of expertise have been identified in order to classify the range of knowledge and competence. The pedagogical approach has highlighted the importance of the tutor who applies narrative tutoring methods to facilitate the recognition of competences and their enhancement for personal and professional development. The full enhancement of competences, considered as the strengthening of people’s reflection and planning potential, requires policies that can be effectively applied to the national competences certification system. © 2020 by the author.

AB  - Language teacher identity (LTI) has become an increasingly central focus in language teaching recently, perhaps because identity is now defined as multiple, complex, shifting, socially constructed, and a site of struggle (Norton, 2013; Song, 2016)—and thus a construct that can and should be intentionally influenced (Varghese, Motha, Park, Reeves, & Trent, 2016). With greater understanding that social justice and a critical orientation to education are not only important but also the duty of educators to enact (Kubota & Miller, 2017), some advocate the placement of LTI development at the center of language teacher education (LTE; De Costa & Norton, 2017a; Varghese et al., 2016). However, the conceptualization of such intentional models of LTE needs development (Varghese et al., 2016). This article begins to conceptualize such an LTE program. The author theorizes LTI and the need for adopting an LTI that is transformative, agentive, and advocacy (TAA)-oriented, and proposes a competencies-based approach as a foundation for developing an LTE program centered on the development of a TAA-oriented LTI, suggesting key competencies to include in such an approach. She presents practical affordances and activities that could be helpful in developing these competencies. The article ends with questions aimed at furthering this emerging scholarly conversation in the field. © 2020 TESOL International Association

AB  - According to EU guidelines, oral expression is one of the key competences students ought to master during their university training. The Spanish educational system, however, has paid little attention to the development of oratory skills and most students fear speaking in public. In the case of those who study interpreting, where speaking in public is, obviously, an essential tool to carry out their task, this lack of training can negatively affect their own learning process. Hence, solving this issue will be key to better acquire the technical skills needed. In order to study the abovementioned shortcoming, this paper will present a study carried out at the University of Salamanca with Consecutive Interpreting undergraduate students. Their experience speaking in public – or lack thereof – has been analyzed through questionnaires and students’ diaries were used as pedagogical introspection and retrospection tools. The usefulness of diaries in educational contexts has already been demonstrated as a valuable didactic strategy, as they foster critical self-analysis and reflection, making students question their vision of the world (Hiemstra 2001) and helping them manage frustration better. As trainers, the students’ diaries had a twofold objective: they offered initial data on the pupils’ experiences and their attitude towards oral presentations, while at the same time allowing teachers to monitor their reactions to the training actions implemented in the classroom to combat the students’ fear of speaking in public. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

AB  - Purpose: There is dearth of studies in the literature which have discussed the relevance of personal and social resources of employees to protect them from adverse impacts of emotional job demands. However, interaction effect of these two resources on wellbeing of the employees in context to emotional work is inadequate. The present study is aimed to address the existing gap and investigate the relevance of personal and social resources as moderators in the presence of each other between emotional work and employee wellbeing. Design/methodology/approach: The research work has focused on employees working on frontline profiles of civil aviation industry of north India. The responses of 720 frontline employees have been collected through pretested questionnaire. To understand the moderation effect of two variables, model number 3 developed by Hayes (2012) has been applied. Findings: The findings have revealed that moderator role of social support between emotional work and employee wellbeing. However, research has pointed out that at high level of social support personal resources of employees' start to decline which subsequently reduces the wellbeing of employees. Research limitations/implications: The present research work has analysed the moderated moderation effect of personal and social resources between emotional work and employee wellbeing. Besides, the relative significance of personal resources vis-a vis social resources empirically in context of employee wellbeing in case of emotional work has also been highlighted in the work. Practical implications: The results of the study have suggested the employees to receive less social support from friends, family and other significant relationships to protect their personal resources in emotional work settings. Moreover, research work has implicated for employers to draw out the various interventions through which personal resources of employees can be enhanced in emotional work settings. Also, the research has assisted in designing the key competencies for different job domains of emotional work setups. Social implications: The present study is very substantial in offering various parameters over which wellbeing policies for individuals can be framed. Also, the study has outlined the consequences of receiving different levels of social support which is applicable for that set of population who wants to enhance their personal resources for attaining high wellbeing. Originality/value: The study has empirically investigated interaction effect of social and personal resources of employees between emotional work and employee wellbeing which is scarce in the literature. Besides, a dark side of social support in emotional work context has also been highlighted which was scarcely discussed in emotional work settings previously. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This article defines the role of start-up projects as a pedagogical tool aimed at consolidating and updating vocational training of students majoring in entrepreneurial studies. It presents an online survey conducted among Russian and Azerbaijan entrepreneurs, which allowed identifying key competencies necessary to practice a flourishing business activity in the current environment. The role of start-ups in strengthening and upgrading entrepreneurship students’ professional competencies was identified based on self-assessment of their professional progress during educational training. The research methodology made it possible to identify levers of influence on students’ involvement in training, the effective usage of which can dramatically change the quality of future specialists’ education due to the synergy of theoretical and practical activities. Using a survey of 50 Russian and Azerbaijani entrepreneurs, selected using a series of filters and based on a random sample, a list of entrepreneurs' competencies and skills was formed. Checking by the Cronbach method a demonstrated the acceptability of the internal reliability of the resulting list (α = .821). This list was used to survey 395 students from 5 Russian and one Azerbaijani universities using the method of assessing on a 4-point Likert scale their results in entrepreneurship training after The practical vocational training in the “Start-up Projects-New Generation” ecosystem, described in this study. The students' assessment of the level of development of their vocational skills turned out to be relevantly high. In practice, the research results can be applied in the creation of entrepreneurship training courses, as well as with the aim of increasing student entrepreneurship motivation and enhancing their practical experience. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.

AB  - The brewing market in Brazil goes through an important transformation where the craft beer, which is carried out in the so-called “microbreweries” has gained more space and consumers. Driven by the entry of increasingly new microbreweries, competition in an unstable economic environment makes the survival of these small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) difficult. SMEs need to constantly improving their human resource in order to survive in the business arena. This paper tries to extract the competencies using a competency model for head brewer job position. Then a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method is used to find the causal relations among key competencies in Brazilian microbrewery industry. The competencies are in four groups including: managerial, interpersonal, technical and personal. The results show that the managerial group of competencies is the most important group in head brewer job position. The results show that the “active listening”, “mental agility”, “emotional resilience” and “proactivity” have the highest level of influence on the other competencies. To the best our knowledge, this is the first application of competency model and DEMATEL in microbrewery industry. © 2020 KIIE

AB  - Skills needed to be successful in the world have changed, and there is a gap between those learned at school and those required to function at work and in society. A broader range of skills is required to learn, communicate, collaborate, and solve problems in digital environments. Twenty-first century skills have been identified by UNESCO, OECD, and others as competences required for a sustainable future of the knowledge society. The aim was to learn the design principles involved in the incorporation of these skills into the curriculum, find out possible ways to teach and assess them, and examine how this process could be personalized using Information and Communications Technology (ICT). A literature review was carried out through a qualitative metasynthesis, which identified 43 studies that met the inclusion criteria. From the in‐depth analysis, it can be seen that although the incorporation of 21st century skills into the curriculum, teaching methodologies, and the use of ICT are all recurrent themes, there is still a need for further research into the design and implementation of new instruments for assessment and the ways in which the teaching–learning process can be personalized. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Throughout the past 40 years, a number of terms have been used in the UK to refer to competency-based pedagogies that focus on preparing students for everyday ‘life’ and employment. The evolution of these generic forms of knowledge in official curricula has been accompanied by harsh practical realities when it comes to teaching, assessing and certifying them. These practical realities counterbalance the strong support genericskillism enjoys in policy discourses that centre on employability and universalism in upper-secondary education. By drawing upon Bernstein's sociological insights and data collected and analysed as part of a study that sought to examine the compulsory integration of Communication and Application of Number into the Welsh Baccalaureate Advanced Diploma (legacy qualification), this paper offers new empirical observations into the persistent peculiarities and challenges of teaching and assessing generic forms of pedagogised knowledge. The discussion takes into consideration practical and policy dimensions that extend beyond individual education sites in Wales and are also relevant to the 2017 review of the new Essential Skills Wales qualifications, ongoing developments following the 2018 review of the Welsh Baccalaureate Skills Challenge Certificate, and the Council of the EU 2018 Recommendation of Key Competences for Lifelong Learning. © 2020 British Educational Research Association

AB  - Many inhabitants of the Northeastern region of India (NER) are poor and have to rely on subsistence farming for a livelihood and are therefore vulnerable to negative impacts of climate change. To enhance the resilience of the farmers and the entire agricultural sector of NER, stakeholders need to acquire additional and/or specialized competencies to deal with the negative impacts of climate change. In this study, we systematically identify and prioritize crucial competencies for change agents, farmers and institutions in NER. We used a modified Delphi methodology with several iterations to lead experts towards a consensus about the most pressing competencies for each stakeholder group. The items were prioritized using a composite scoring approach. The findings reveal that for change agents in NER, an open-minded attitude and expertise in linking farmers to markets are highly rated competencies. For the farmers, eco-friendly farming skills and a problem-solving attitude emerged as key competencies. Biodiversity conservation and integrated farming skills are also highly desirable. Concerning the institutions, the Krishi Vigyan Kendras (farm science centers) have to play a priority role in implementing policies promoting sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture, as they are the institutional link to farming communities. The experts are confident that the overall sustainability of the agricultural sector in NER can be considerably enhanced by developing these key competencies. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Diagnosis is the cornerstone of providing safe and effective medical care. Still, diagnostic errors are all too common. A key to improving diagnosis in practice is improving diagnosis education, yet formal education about diagnosis is often lacking, idiosyncratic, and not evidence based. In this Invited Commentary, the authors describe the outcomes of a national consensus project to identify key competencies for diagnosis and the themes that emerged as part of this work. The 12 competencies the authors describe span 3 categories - individual, teamwork, and system related - and address ideal diagnostic practice for all health professionals. In addition, the authors identify strategies for improving diagnosis education, including the use of theory-based pedagogy and interprofessional approaches, the recognition of the role of the health care system to enhance or inhibit the diagnostic process, and the need to focus on the individual attributes necessary for high-quality diagnosis, such as humility and curiosity. The authors conclude by advocating for increasing and improving the assessment of individual and team-based diagnostic performance in health professions education programs. © by the Association of American Medical Colleges.

AB  - Digital skills are thought to be a key competence of the twenty-first century. With the rapid growth of internet and communication tool (ICT) usage among both students and teachers, cooperative (co-op) education programmes, like other educational institutions, face the challenge of integrating and supporting digital skill development. However, little is known about how these skills are developed prior to entering cooperative education programmes. Against this background, a sample of 893 freshers, ranging from vocational students to co-op students, were tested according to their digital skills. The analysis shows that co-op students have a higher level of competence than vocational students. In addition, we found that in our sample social background has no impact on digital competences. The results are discussed and classified in the context of the current state of research. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - This article focused on the distance-learning context created by the COVID-19. The objectives were to assess the differences between highly-structured cooperative learning (HSCL) and individual learning (IL) in university students’ content knowledge, and to assess the impact of the teacher’s highly-structured instruction on the variables that mediate CL. Students enrolled in a teacher training programme (n = 201, Mage  = 20.38±4.97) were classified in two groups. Participants in the HSCL group showed higher academic achievement. It was also observed that the HSCL environment was related to the five variables that mediate CL. These results identified three important considerations in university teaching: CL is a key competence that can have an impact on the students’ learning process and it should be a key element in teacher-training programs; this competence should be incorporated by lecturers to deliver a structured learning process; and these objectives can be achieved in an online learning environment. © 2021 Association for Teacher Education in Europe.

AB  - This article describes an original international approach to inclusion and non-formal learning of socially excluded young people, through participatory internet radio - RadioActive101. First, we critically discuss the social and digital exclusion of young people. We then describe our approach - that includes participatory action research methods that are influenced by the work of Dewey and Freire, and operate as a process of complex intervention. This supports the inclusive co-production of radio content in ways that support non-formal learning in two EU contexts–the UK and Portugal. We then summarise and compare a qualitative investigation of RadioActive101. This showed positive results, with important similarities and differences between the two contexts. Participants reported that RadioActive101 was motivating and contributed to the development of contemporary skills, and also stimulated improvements in psychosocial dimensions such as confidence (self-efficacy) and self-esteem. This investigation informed the development of an original recognition system for non-formal learning that maps EU Key Competences for Lifelong Learning to radio practices and activities that are recognised through electronic badges. Our reflections emphasise that in order to support the non-formal learning of socially excluded young people we must foreground our attention to fostering psychosocial dimensions alongside developing contemporary competences. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the effect of the agricultural teaching approaches employed in secondary schools on skills development for food security in Kenya. Design/Methodology/Approach: Descriptive survey design was employed targeting 46,340 students and 235 agriculture teachers. The actual sample size constituted 490 students in 20 focus discussion groups and 111 agriculture teachers. Data was collected using an Agriculture Teachers’ Interview Schedule and a Students’ Focus Group Discussion Guide. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using inferential statistics and content analysis respectively. Findings: The agricultural teaching approaches employed in secondary schools positively contributed to skills development leading to increased food security. However, the low integration of practical agriculture with hands on experiences derailed adequate skills development and their application for food security. Practical implication: The findings of the study may be used as inputs for the Kenyan education policymakers to develop a guideline on incorporation of agriculture practical sessions on school timetables, school community-based agriculture projects and holiday-based field attachments for students for better skills development as targeted by the Competence Based Curriculum (CBC). Theoretical Implications: This paper makes a contribution to the growing body of knowledge by highlighting learning opportunities that can create more hands-on skills driven towards food security in any country. Originality/value: In current studies on secondary school agriculture in developing countries, a framework which incorporates school community-based projects and field attachments is hardly found. When incorporated into the theory, the approaches can be avenues for enhancing food security from the secondary school level. © 2019, © 2019 Wageningen University.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the views of preservice teachers from Turkey and Sweden about twenty-first century skills. The participants of the study were 197 preservice teachers from universities in Turkey and Sweden. In the study, the views of preservice teachers about twenty-first century skills were investigated with an open-ended questionnaire, and the collected qualitative data were analysed using a content analysis method. The findings indicate that within the context of daily life, the preservice teachers from both countries associated twenty-first century skills mostly with technology, digital citizenship, communication, and information literacy. Within the context of education, a great majority of the preservice teachers from Turkey associated twenty-first century skills with information literacy and technology, while those from Sweden associated twenty-first century skills mostly with technology, distance learning and communication. In addition, it was seen that among the skills considered by the preservice teachers from both countries to be necessary for their careers and for their future students, they all put most emphasis on digital literacy. However, as the second most frequent skills, the preservice teachers from Turkey emphasized critical thinking and problem solving skills, while the preservice teachers from Sweden mentioned communication skills and information literacy. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A number of attempts have been made to determine the key competencies for librarians supporting scholarly communications (SC), but it remains unclear what technical competencies are required. To explore this issue, the study undertook thematic analysis of in-depth semi-structured interviews with UK based librarians working in SC. Typical technologies in use were identified and six typical ways of talking about technologies uncovered. Partly because of the out-sourcing of key technologies, SC librarians need soft skills and certain positive orientations to technology rather than practical technical skills. They acquire these skills through learning on the job and through communities of learning. A concept of socio-technological competence is proposed to encapsulate this skillset. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The implementation of inclusive education continues to pose challenges to teachers world-wide and Botswana is no exception. This study aimed to explore the teaching competencies general education teachers in Botswana primary schools perceived as important to their teaching in inclusive classrooms. Using a quantitative research approach, 116 general education primary school teachers completed a 14-Item questionnaire titled Perceived Competencies for Inclusive Teaching Scale, and an open-ended question about the supportive resources they required to be effective in their classrooms. Descriptive statistics, ANOVA and t-tests were used to analyse the data. The results of this study showed that participants identified adaptive instructional competencies (including setting curricula goals, modifying learning content and teaching to the different learning styles of students) as most important. Human resources (teacher aides, specialist teachers,) followed by material resources were seen to be key support resources required for them to be able to implement IE. This study could be used as a baseline for future research on key competencies and resources for primary school teachers for inclusive education. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study examined three cases in which an online support system was utilized to enhance creative problem solving (CPS) in a higher education setting. This study aimed to review instructional design strategies that allow the integration of an online support system into a university course. Creativity, which is defined as the ability to generate a new and useful idea, is a key competency for students to possess as it can assist them in taking effective actions in the future society. Considered to be a representative model for developing creative thinking abilities, the CPS model is known to effectively stimulate learners’ divergent and convergent thinking while supporting a systematic approach to find creative solutions and enabling meaningful learning by utilizing its supporting tools. Considering the advantages derived from using the Online Support System for CPS, three cases across diverse colleges were reviewed: the College of Education, Fine Arts, and Engineering. Through comprehensive analysis, this study proposes major design strategies to achieve the integrated application of the Online Support System to university courses that encourage problem solving abilities. The study also suggests future research directions for CPS using the Online Support System. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Gerontology and geriatrics are quintessentially interdisciplinary fields. To understand aging, an interdisciplinary perspective is necessary; to provide quality care to older adults with complex, chronic conditions, an interprofessional team is required. Academic, clinical, and community-based settings–with their vertical organizational structures–need bridging strategies to create networks that support interdisciplinary education in both classroom and experiential settings. Taking on these challenges requires emphasizing the importance of key competencies that integrate the unique perspectives, contributions, and roles of different disciplines, and creating the connections critical for promoting interdisciplinary education. First, this paper develops a theoretical foundation for networking to construct and maintain educational and service provider partnerships. Second, the organizational and institutional requirements for successful networking are explored, based on both empirical research and principles from the theoretical framework. Finally, practical recommendations for the development of key strategies for implementing and sustaining interdisciplinary and academic-clinical-community partnerships are summarized. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The characteristics of contemporary educational environments, abundant in activities and often-excessive use of digital technologies, highlight the need for providing psychophysical balance to the student inner experience, current situation that stimulates teachers’ interest to the consideration of silence as an educative act, crucial to any less saturated, and more balanced formative process. Current scientific literature is reviewed here about silence as an enhancer of neurophysiology, e.g.: on neurogenesis and default network inductor; and psychosocial development, e.g.: on self-regulative attentional skills and/or language processing quality; suggesting it already involves the preconditions to be systematically introduced as a pedagogical tool, a task still to be done and to which this paper tributes. For this goal, a brief review on the contemplative orientation in teaching and learning is exposed as a theoretical and practical framework interested in silence as a tool of learning, psychological growth, and social transformation, through awareness development and relational-ethical behavior. Some implications are described then for competence-based education, and the possibility of articulating the practice of silence with the development of procedural competences. Finally, some limitations are addressed in order to raise awareness of the best path to tread in promoting silence and its benefits for teaching and learning environments © 2021, Educ. Pesqui.

AB  - The nature of education has changed significantly in Poland recent years based on the rapidly changing reality of political, social and professional life and greater emphasis has been placed on a communicative model of teaching which has required the development of new sets of skills or competences by teachers. In this study research on the competences of early school education teachers was carried out in primary schools in the southern part of Poland in the area of Silesian Voivodship. A diagnostic survey was applied as a way of collecting information about the state of social awareness, opinions and views of the community of teachers. The research used a survey questionnaire (self-assessment) directed to a representative sample of 121 active early years teachers. The study analysed the respondents’ answers to four questions about the factors, activities, nature and role of competences in the work of a leading teacher, who is a form teacher of children in classes I–III. The results show the importance of early years teachers placed on different sets professional competences especially in relation to the preparation of the best materials for curriculum delivery, pupil motivation, and classroom organisation. © 2020 ASPE.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant disruptions to medical education. The patient care space was unavailable as a learning environment, which compounded the complexity of preparing students for clerkships with a traditional transition to clerkship (TTC) curriculum. We developed a multimodal, structured approach to re-introduce students to the clinical space prior to the start of clerkships. 105 second year medical students completed a 4-week clinical enhancement course. A modified Delphi method was used to select core topics, which were then anchored to key Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs). Students participated in 9 virtual problem-based cases, workshops and multiple supervised patient encounters. Students were surveyed before, during, and after the course; responses were compared with paired t-tests. 25.9% rated the course as excellent, 44.2% as very good, and 19.5% as good. Compared to baseline, self-perceived efficacy grew significantly (P < 0.05) across all EPAs. Improvements in key competencies were sustained when students were surveyed 2 weeks into their first clerkship. This was a well-received, novel course, focused on helping students transition back into the clinical space through a multimodal teaching approach. This framework may be used by other institutions seeking to restructure their TTC initiatives. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In France, the notion of competence began to be discussed in the early 1990s and was finally enforced in the Education Act of 23 April 2005. Since its emergence, this notion has been strongly opposed by a certain number of teachers, unions and researchers. To understand how competence-based education finally prevailed, I take into account the fundamentally polysemic nature of this notion. After pointing out its origins, I examine how its different meanings have been synthesised within the Common Core established in 2005. I then study the contradictions to which the implementation of this hybrid object has given rise, before analysing the new compromise that was found in the 2015 reform. To do this, I use the data from numerous archives and a series of interviews with the main actors of curriculum reforms in France since the 1980s. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - China and the US have responded to the challenges of a knowledge-based society, technological advancement, and global competition by implementing educational reforms to impart skills or competencies required of 21st century students. This study compares the rationales, content, and curricula design of both countries’ key competencies frameworks and explores the possibility of reciprocal learning. Although their frameworks have certain similarities, significant differences have arisen due to cultural factors. The Chinese framework follows the Confucian tradition, emphasising moral education, political inclinations, transferring general competencies to specific-subject ones, and integrating key competencies in the national curriculum. The US framework follows the pragmatic tradition, emphasising generic skills and economic needs. Some US states have attempted to revise curriculum standards or incorporate 21st century skills by identifying their alignment with Common Core State Standards. Both frameworks have deficiencies and face challenges in implementation, and they can learn from each other. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this article is to substantiate the psychological conditions that determine the content, forms, ways of organising, and promoting the process of socialisation of gifted students. Background: The success of modern man largely depends on his socialisation – the ability to see and understand others, analyse the course of events, to capture the prospects for development. Therefore, the key competencies include, among others, information and communication and social as those that ensure the successful acquisition of knowledge throughout life and entry into society. Method: A set of methods was used in the study: analysis, synthesis, generalisation, and systematisation of scientific data, observations, questionnaires, document analysis, methods of mathematical data processing. An online testing platform was developed to conduct a survey of students. Results: The authors proposed and implemented a project aimed at providing psychological and pedagogical support to gifted students; to provide the teaching staff with the necessary knowledge and skills to work with gifted children, to encourage participants in the educational process to use information and communications technology tools in educational activities. A model of psychological support and accompaniment of participants in the educational process has been developed. Conclusion: The experiment showed positive changes in socialisation in the experimental group in relation to the control group at a significant level. The findings of the study give grounds to conclude that the proposed author’s comprehensive approach promotes the socialisation of gifted students. © 2021. Lifescience Global

AB  - Background/purposeContemporary teaching focuses on the students active role in the acquisition of knowledge and largely neglects the role of emotions. Given the importance of empathy when it comes to the emotional development of the individual, and the opportunities offered by history as a subject with regard to encouraging empathy, the main purpose of research is to analyze the extent to which history textbooks contribute to empathy as one of key competencies of today s world. Materials/methods-In the research, qualitative and quantitative content analysis was used. The analysis includes only one didactic-methodical toolkit of the textbook-questions and tasks by the formulation of which it is possible to identify in which direction the teaching process "moves" and to what extent it encourages the cultivation of emotions. Results-The results suggest that high school history textbooks overemphasize the cognitive aspect of the learning process while simultaneously inadequately putting students in a position that would also allow them to be more emotionally engaged with the historical events and to thereby develop empathy. Conclusion-It is necessary to develop detailed guidelines with clear instructions on how to encourage students emotional engagement in individual subjects and teaching units. © 2021 Universitepark.

AB  - Creativity, a key competency required for students to prepare for the future, has been emphasized in school-based science education in recent years. Some studies have proposed that a better understanding of the collective nature of creativity in group settings is essential for a full explanation of creativity. However, few attempts have been made to understand the collective nature of creativity in science classrooms. The purpose of this study is to conceptualize the creativity expressed by students learning individually or collectively in a science classroom by developing a componential model of science classroom creativity (SCC). We derive five dimensions of SCC (student characteristics, engagement in science class, science teacher support, science classroom environment, and creative behavior) from literature reviews. Then, critical incidents technique, classroom observations, and focus-group interviews are applied to identify SCC components reflecting real science education contexts. As a result, we develop an SCC model with 10 components and 24 subcomponents. Our SCC model provides a theoretical basis for understanding collective creativity in the science classroom, and it can also be used as a practical framework to analyze SCC in the science classroom. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study demonstrates the possibilities of using massive open online courses in engineering education. In order to study the impact of digital learning formats on the acquisition of key engineering competencies by students, an educational experiment was carried out; it was performed as part of the study of the Fire Safety discipline on the basis of the online educational platform Khan Academy. Conceptually, the educational process was aimed at studying the capabilities of software in the field of fire safety, namely: PyroSim, Pathfinder, FireRisk, FIM, FireCategories, PromRisk, FireDistance, as well as gaining professional competencies in the process of performing practical tasks. The educational experiment involved third-year intramural and extramural students of the Faculty of Engineering (The Saint-Petersburg University of the State Fire Service of the EMERCOM of Russia) and Moscow City Pedagogical University. The online educational course was conducted with an emphasis on consolidation and acquisition of professional engineering knowledge and skills in the development of fire safety projects under simulated risk conditions using modern software and an innovative educational platform. The participants demonstrated a high level of involvement, initiative and professional aspirations in the learning process. In the context of the educational experiment, the key competencies required for 21st century engineers have been identified. The students confirmed the positive impact of digital pedagogical tools on the acquisition and development of key competencies necessary for further professional activity. Having completed an online course on the Khan Academy platform focused on the applied interaction with advanced software in the field of fire safety, students identified skills that should be developed and consolidated, namely: Teamwork skills and the ability to work in multidisciplinary teams, the ability to manage projects (management, planning, scheduling, budgeting, etc.); the ability to define, formulate and solve engineering problems; the ability to effectively prioritize; striving for lifelong learning; willingness to take a calculated risk; ability to make professional decisions; self-regulation and self-motivation. However, the development of important engineering competencies such as high ethical standards, honesty and global social, intellectual and technological responsibility; good communication skills, high emotional intelligence and cognitive flexibility; entrepreneurial spirit and customer focus requires educators to search for different pedagogical methods and practices. The assessment of the impact of digital learning formats on the acquisition of key engineering competencies was subjective, but revealed pedagogical approaches to the qualitative development of engineering personnel. An effective combination of traditional classroom and virtual interactions can create a complex paradigm of highquality engineering and technical education that is competitive in the market environment. © 2021 Kassel University Press GmbH.

AB  - The methodological paradigm advanced in European higher education during recent decades focuses on the concept of ‘competence’ to achieve student employability. This professionalization of education requires more flexible and active teaching-learning contexts. This paper presents an empirical research into the application of project-based learning (PBL) in postgraduate studies of finance in the University of Jaén (Spain). Considering the important role that students’ perspective plays in their own motivation and performance, we pursue three main objectives. First, we aim to analyse students’ perceptions of the effectiveness of this methodology to improve some key competences for student employability. Second, we explore whether the perceived utility of these competences changes after the PBL experiment. Finally, we aim to explore students’ opinion about the usefulness, advantages and disadvantages of this method. Our findings support the perceived effectiveness of PBL for improving teamwork, communication, creativity, organization and information management competences. In addition, results show that students were highly satisfied, emphasizing the superiority of PBL in comparison with traditional learning methods, and its usefulness for learning about financing sources and to making contact with the business world. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper examines competency-based educational policy-making in a global context. Specifically, it explores how the thinking around competency, spearheaded by international organisations and experts, has led to the development and deployment of a particular notion of global competency. Drawing on critical policy research, I examine three international policy events in which experts convened to discuss, debate, and co-construct ideas related to competencies in education. I argue that by structuring the assessment of knowledge and fixing meanings, the OECD, along with networks of experts, has created and diffused a particular social imaginary of a globally competent learner. Given the complexity and uncertainty of the world today, increasing the global and intercultural knowledge and awareness of the world’s students is vitally important. Yet, with so much at stake, researchers must critically examine the processes through which educational futures are being imagined while at the same time, pursuing more equitable and inclusive education policy-making within and beyond the nation-state. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The ecosystem-based management (EBM) philosophy draws upon the principle that holistic understanding of the system to be governed needs to guide the decision-making process. However, empirical evidence is growing that knowledge integration is still a main bottleneck for EBM decision-makers. This paper argues that transdisciplinary knowledge management (TKM) is a key competence in achieving knowledge integration, while simultaneously it represents an underdeveloped research area in EBM if understood as a process of human interaction. Based on a literature review, this article summarizes and reflects upon the most recent development in the field of TKM. The paper presents a detailed definition and in-depth description of TKM as a process of human interaction and a diversity of organizational structures that effectuate TKM. Theoretically discussed premises are furthermore illuminated and evaluated by a case study that exemplifies pro-active development and implementation of TKM. Deviating case observations are presented as novel contributions to the field. They suggest new ideas and inspiration for future EBM research and policy agendas. © 2020

AB  - Education and literacy are important aspects of health promotion. The potential for health literacy to promote healthier choices has been widely examined, with studies variously incorporating food literacy, nutrition literacy and/or media literacy as components of health literacy, rather than treating each as unique concepts for health promotion. This study examines similarities and differences across health literacy, food literacy, nutrition literacy and health-promoting media literacy to highlight how each literacy type theorizes the relationship between education and health. A meta-review of existing scoping and systematic reviews examining literacy conceptualizations was conducted to examine the four literacies. Representative concept definitions were extracted and key competencies (or skills) and desired consequences were identified and grouped into subcategories for analysis. This study located 378 articles, of which 17 scoping/systematic reviews were included (10 for health literacy, 3 for food, 1 for nutrition and 3 for media). Representative concept definitions of the four literacy types revealed three skill categories (information acquisition, information analysis, and the application of information) and three categories of desired consequences (knowledge, attitudes and behaviors), with each of the four literacy types emphasizing varied collections of skills and desired consequences. Despite perceived similarities in content, health, food, nutrition and media literacy conceptualize the relationship between education and health differently, emphasizing the distinct types of knowledge to promote health-related outcomes. A better understanding of the differences between these four literacies will lead to informed decision making for researchers, educators and health practitioners in intervention design and implementation. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

AB  - The essential of presented paper is to analyze the impact of the project manager's age on the preference of key competences in the project practice regarding the petrochemical industry in EU countries. The primary method of data acquisition was electronic questioning. We used the International Competence Baseline version 4 as the theoretical basis for the analysis. The research sample of the respondents was intentional, 78 respondents working as project managers in the petrochemical industry in EU countries were addressed. We also used linear and regression analysis to analyse the correlation of the key competence elements preference and the project manager's age. We concluded that the preference of the key competence elements of project managers in the petrochemical industry of EU countries did not change with age. © 2020 Kateřina Bočková, Daniel Lajcin & Tomáš Lengyelfalusy.

AB  - English writing is a key competence for higher education success. However, research on the assessment of writing skills in English as a foreign language in European upper secondary education (i.e. beyond year 9) remains scarce. The Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) describes language proficiency on a scale of six ascending levels (A1-C2). For writing skills at the end of secondary education in Europe, the common standard is vantage level B2. In this study, experts from Germany and Switzerland linked upper secondary students’ writing profiles elicited in a constructed response test (integrated and independent essays from the TOEFL iBT®) to CEFR levels. Standard setting methodology (a modified examinee paper selection/performance profile approach) was used to establish the linkages. The study reports the methodology and procedure of the standard setting process and discusses the procedural and internal validity of resulting cut scores. It also applies the cut scores to a large sample of upper secondary students in Germany and Switzerland to gain evidence for external and consequential validity. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Science and technology play an important role in the development of human society. Thus, science education should reflect the trend of social development and prepare students to think about and make wise decisions on major social topics related to science. As an aspect of the societal dimension of science, socio-scientific topics (SSTs) have a great influence on social development. In order to prepare students to participate in modern social life effectively, shape the society in a sustainable way, and become responsible citizens in the future, what major SSTs should science curriculum relevant to students and the society focus on? In this study, the famous forecasting method, the Delphi method, was used to explore the above-mentioned question. Thirty-three experts who came from Chinese universities and scientific research institutes were invited to make effective decisions based on the backgrounds of social development and students’ all-round development demands during a three-stage Delphi process. The results showed that six level-one SSTs that referred to the generalized and superior socio-scientific fields and thirty corresponding level-two SSTs that referred to their specific and inferior topics achieved consensus and should be emphasized in the science curriculum. The six level-one SSTs are “environmental issues,” “safety and health,” “resources and energy,” “ecological system,” “biotechnology,” and “new materials.” It is believed that the conclusion is helpful to promote the development of students’ key competencies and can provide advice and enlightenment for science curriculum reform all over the world. © 2019, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to explore the relationship between introspection and key competencies for sustainable consumption (KCSCs). It investigates whether mindfulness training can cultivate the ability to introspect and stimulate the development of KCSCs. Design/methodology/approach: Two independent studies were analyzed. Data were retrieved from interviews with participants of a consumer-focused mindfulness training (Study 1, 11 participants), as well as from diaries of students attending a university seminar with mindfulness training (Study 2, 13 students), and made subject to qualitative content analysis. Findings: Both studies show a clear intersection between both constructs and suggest that mindfulness training can contribute to the development of KCSCs and learners’ ability to introspect. The studies also demonstrated that introspection is not equally related to all competencies and that KCSCs must not be reduced to introspection. Research limitations/implications: Both KCSCs and introspection are complex and latent constructs and hence challenging to observe. The research understands itself as a first exploratory approach for empirically investigating this complex relation. Originality/value: While increasing (self-)reflectivity is at the core of competence-based education, a systematic engagement with the practice of introspection as a means to enhancing reflectivity is surprisingly lacking. Mindfulness training could be a promising way to cultivate introspective abilities and thus facilitate learning processes that are conducive to competence development. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Introduction: Numerous frameworks and tools have been developed to assist medical schools striving to achieve their social accountability mandate. The purpose of this study was to design an instrument to evaluate medical students’ perceptions of the key competencies of a ‘socially accountable’ healthcare practitioner using widely accepted frameworks which contain clear measurable outcomes. Methods: The instrument was designed in three phases: selection of a competency-based framework, development of items, and validation of the instrument through exploratory factor analysis. Medical students in the 6‑year medical degree program at the University of Cape Town, South Africa were invited to participate in the study. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was performed using Stata/SE version 13.1. Results: Of 619 students invited to participate in the study, 484 (78%) responded. The CanMEDS framework was selected for designing the instrument, which comprised 35 statements reflecting five competencies for each CanMEDS role. Exploratory factor analysis of the student responses yielded a 28-item instrument. There was a significant difference in overall Perceptions of Social Accountability Instrument (PSAI) scores between men and women (p = 0.002) but no significant difference between the overall PSAI scores for students in the respective years of study. Discussion: This study describes the design of an instrument to evaluate medical students’ perceptions of the essential competencies of socially accountable healthcare practitioners. Used longitudinally, the data may provide evidence of the successes of our programs and identify areas where further improvements are required. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - This article undertakes a diagnostic study of the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) sub-sector in Uganda, with a view to characterizing the sub-sector and identifying its potential strengths and weakness. We undertook a cross-sectional pre-survey of purposively selected key stakeholders in the TVET sub-sector. We selected performance indicators following their importance in influencing the TVET reform process. Both qualitative and quantitative data was solicited from the stakeholders. Quantitative data was collected through stakeholder-specific structured questionnaires, whilst qualitative data was collected through desk review and field visits, individual focused interviews and focus group discussions. Our findings indicate that financing and planning constraints have resulted in poor quality equipment, under- and ill-trained staff, limited adoption of a competence-based education and training (CBET) curriculum, not to mention the supervision inadequacies of TVET institutions. Besides, the limited TVET sub-sector interaction with the private sector has incapacitated TVET curriculum development to nurture skills demanded by the private sector. Furthermore, backward technology use in the private sector has equally inhibited the success of student attachment programmes. Finally, legal ambiguities have perpetuated a qualification jungle and overlapping curricula. © The Authors 2018. Development Policy Review © 2018 Overseas Development Institute

AB  - This paper contributes to the research on discrepancy between employers´ needs and graduates’ competencies acquired at bachelor education. Given the fact that internationalizing SMEs have considered international relation competency (IRC) to be the key competency for starting export professionals, this qualitative study examines whether this key competency with its selected knowledge, skills and attitudes has been integrated into the curriculum of a bachelor program in International Business at a Dutch University of Applied Sciences. Based on a document analysis of this bachelor program and interviews with lecturers and alumni of this program, we found that the training of international relationship competency is almost absent in the curriculum. Both lecturers and alumni envision skills and attitude development to be incorporated into the curriculum of this internationally oriented bachelor program. The findings offer some suggestions for further research concerning developing cooperation between business and education and the assessment of international relation competency within the context of IB education. © 2020, Sciedu Press.

AB  - Intercultural competence (IC) is a key competence in individuals’ life. Educational programs carried out to date have been motivated by the presence of culturally diverse students. This situation calls for programs to be implemented in low cultural diversity contexts, considering its repercussion on all students. This study aimed to explore the impact of a Sport Education Model (SEM)-based program about games from around the world on seventh-grade students’ intercultural competence and friendship goals. A quasi-experimental control group design (pre-test, post-test, and retention test measures) was carried out. The experimental group (EG) followed a SEM-based program (18 sessions) about games from around the world, whilst the control group (CG) was not exposed to any specific treatment, continuing with its ordinary syllabus. Data were collected from questionnaires, interviews and field notes. EG obtained significant improvements on reward, help, intercultural understanding and friendship-approach goals; whereas CG had significant diminishment on both intercultural sensitivity and understanding, as well as on friendship goals. Qualitative results conveyed: (a) an approach to new cultural realities; (b) how the teaching content led to cultural reflection; (c) how students created new relationships; (d) greater collaborative relationships; (e) how the model helped to mitigate negative behaviours; and (f) how the intervention provided students with greater opportunities for participation. Games from around the world are shown to be a suitable content for developing IC, suggesting the need for expanding evidence about possible effects of new teaching contents when conjugated with SEM. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Against the backdrop of the push from the European Commission and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development for competence-based curricula, this article problematises the complexity of developing twenty-first century skills, such as critical thinking, by addressing the role transnational and national policy contexts play in realising critical thinking in the national contexts of Sweden and Kosovo. The article distinguishes between policy-critical thinking and civic-critical thinking. Relying on analyses of curriculum and policy documents, it is concluded that while in the Swedish context critical thinking competence (or ability) seems to be much more implicit than explicit, in Kosovo, the national curriculum makes explicit references to thinking competences as a form of policy-critical thinking and civic competencies as a form of civic-critical thinking. Thus, students in both contexts have opportunities to develop critical thinking skills. Furthermore, Sweden emerges as a divergent case and Kosovo as a convergent case with regard to transnational policy flow research paradigms. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The increasing presence and relevance of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in learning scenarios has imposed new demands on teachers, who must be able to design new learning situations while relying on the growing supply of available digital resources. One of the fields that more urgently needs to utilize the potential benefits of ICT to transform learning is sustainability, and more precisely the development of sustainability competences (SCs). Indeed, wider societal changes are needed that ensure a balance between economic growth, respect for the environment, and social justice, and these changes must start with individual action, knowledge, and the capacity and willingness to act (i.e., the definition of "competence"). However, although there is a wide consensus on the fact that education should ensure the acquisition of competences for life, making this a reality may be more problematic. This difficulty stems, partly, from a lack of a definition of the intervening elements (knowledge, skills, values, attitudes) that enables the integration of competences into specific learning sequences and activities. Taking into account all the above and the difficulties that teachers face in choosing relevant resources and incorporating competences into their planning, we propose a series of indicators that serve to characterize the four dimensions of scientific competence: contents of science, contents about science, the value of science, and the utility of science in educational materials. Although primarily intended for filtering multimedia resources in an educational platform, this instrument (as well as the indicators therein) can be extrapolated to the selection and management of a variety of resources and activities, eventually selecting those that are more useful for the acquisition of the scientific competence. They can also provide learning-managers with a common ground to work on by sharing the objectives and indicators related to the acquisition of competences. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Stakeholders in vocational education have difficulties communicating and collaborating on the design of education because they often lack a shared understanding of what constitutes effective student learning. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the perspectives of teacher educators, teachers and students on good education in vocational education are aligned with what literature says about Powerful Learning Environments (PLEs) and to what extent the perspectives of different groups of stakeholders are mutually aligned. Results of nine focus group interviews showed that perspectives are mostly similar in the three groups. They strongly favoured authentic and challenging pathways, endorsed the importance of supporting opportunities for developing key competences and, although not univocal by students, adaptive teaching and learning support, within a positive and safe learning community. Differences between preferences of different stakeholders on some of the design characteristics of PLEs underline the importance of developing a shared understanding about learning and teaching among stakeholders. © 2019, © 2019 Association for Teacher Education in Europe.

AB  - Based on the qualitative data gathered from the existing literature pertaining to science curriculum with analytical and critical research designs, this article considers the implementation of the science Competence-Based Curriculum (CBC) in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. The study findings reveal that even though the CBC has been introduced in different SSA countries to enhance the quality of education, the science curriculum is still implemented in traditional ways. Consequently, CBC is not effectively addressing socio-economic needs as intended, at both individual and national level. The authors are concerned with how CBC is being implemented in other SSA countries that recently have adopted this kind of curriculum and how it will be implemented in other SSA countries that are planning to embrace it. In this paper, the authors suggest ways the new ideas could be introduced and reflect on how CBC can be implemented in SSA countries that share socio-economic and environmental similarities. They finally strongly recommend the establishment of special ‘laboratory’ schools or science education centres as well as school-based communities of practice to enhance teachers’ content knowledge and nurture contemporary teaching methods for the successful implementation of the new ideas. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The Council of Europe’s Reference Framework of Competences for Democratic Culture (RFCDC) was published in April 2018, and is currently being implemented in a number of Council of Europe member states. The RFCDC consists of three main components: a conceptual model of the competences that learners need to acquire in order to respond appropriately and effectively to democratic and intercultural situations; validated and scaled descriptors and learning outcomes for all of the competences in the model; and guidance for ministries of education and education practitioners on curriculum, pedagogy, assessment, teacher education, the whole-school approach, and building learners’ resilience to radicalization. This article describes the policy background that motivated and accompanied the development of the RFCDC, and the process through which it was developed. It also provides an overview of the contents of the RFCDC, and an explanation of the impact that the framework is beginning to have on Council of Europe actions in the sphere of formal education. © 2020 Barrett.

AB  - The importance of preparation for citizenship has been recognized for millennia, while education for democracy has been central to pedagogical thinking in Europe and in Hungary for more than a quarter of a century (Crick Report, European Year of Citizenship through Education, EU key competences1, modified version of the NCC). Educating a citizenry that is capable of thinking independently, is equipped with critical skills and can deliberate about matters appears in these documents as a definitive goal. The concept of civic competence or citizenship competence indicates a combination of such knowledge, skills, abilities and values that make the individual capable of effectively participating in an everyday life that is based on democratic values as well as in civic society (Hoskins & Crick, 2008, cited by Kinyó, 2012). The various models of preparation in schools assume that civic knowledge has identifiable elements that can be taught (e.g. texts of legal documents, constitutional principles, the structure of the state); at the same time, civic ‘knowledge’ comprises rather the adoption of attitudes and the practice of certain skills. This study, supported by research data based on survey questions, seeks to discover the degree of prevalence of education for democracy and citizenship in everyday practice, as well as the kinds of problems those affected see in this area and what recommendations they have to address these difficulties. © Wochenschau Verlag, Frankfurt/M.

AB  - Instructional design and training skills have become a key competency that is expected of public health professionals. However, the research on educating public health students as instructional designers (ID) is lacking. The purpose of this study is to better understand how novice IDs design trainings using their design judgment in an authentic instructional design project in order to provide them with effective educational supports. The data sources of this case study include 11 training lesson plans generated by 37 students through a semester and six semi-structured interviews. The findings reveal that: (1) online games, (2) instructional videos, (3) handouts, (4) PowerPoint presentation slides, and (5) infographics were designed and used by novice IDs. In the midst of the various challenges that were encountered, framing judgment, core judgment, instrumental judgment, navigational judgment, and appearance judgment were manifested in the design process of novice IDs. Based on the findings, practical implementations are recommended to develop effective instructional design curricula for novice public health student designers. © 2020 by the authors; licensee CEDTECH by Bastas.

AB  - Project managers have a main role in all kinds of projects, and information systems (IS) projects are not an exception. In order to perform their activities well, project managers need to develop several complementary competences, including technical, contextual and behavioral competences. In literature we find important references on the project managers' general competences as, for instance, the ICB from IPMA. However, very little attention has been paid to the eventually distinctive features of IS project managers. In order to identify the most important competences of these project managers, we carried out a questionnaire-based survey. The results show that the top 12 competences are: communication; engagement and motivation; project requirements and objectives; leadership; reliability; results orientation; conflict and crisis; project orientation; teamwork; interested parties; resilience (emerging as a new competence); and ethics. Furthermore, results indicated that the project management bodies of knowledge are suitable to characterize the IS project manager's competences. © 2019, IGI Global.

AB  - The globalisation of labour markets makes language skills one of the key competences required by employers nowadays. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the wage premium from the foreign language skills earned by Poles. Poles seem to be a good case study, because the Polish language is not used for international communication and as many as 58% of Poles command at least one foreign language. I use data from three waves (2012–2014) of the Human Capital Balance survey with a pooled sample of about 35,000 individuals. I estimate a wage equation with the Heckman correction for selection to employment and I check for robustness with propensity score matching. I find that the advanced command of a foreign language yields a wage premium of 11% on average. Interestingly, I find a much higher wage premium from proficiency in Spanish (32%), French (22%) or Italian (15%) than from proficiency in English (11%) or German (12%). © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Practical training is an integral part of training for any future profession. Improving and extending the practical training for future teachers, by strengthening the development of the required key competences oriented towards teacherś critical and creative thinking, has been in the centre of attention in education in Slovakia. Future teachers enter the practice with many ideas on what is expected of good teaching to represent. However, their teaching style often lacks creativity, ability to assess or self-assess, as well as higher level of critical thinking when choosing appropriate methods and procedures. The objective of this article is to point out the application of observational video-studies, using the AAA method as a means of strengthening practical teacher preparation with emphasis on critical thinking development among educators in technical subjects. This paper is a followup to the previous study Implementation of Critical Thinking Strategies in School Subject Technology: A Preliminary Studý. © 2020 Monika Valentová, Peter Brecka; published by UIKTEN.

AB  - Learning to learn has been under the research and policy spotlight in the new millennium; it has taken centre stage in Europe, before and after the 2006 Recommendation on Key Competences. However, learning to learn is labelled by some as a non-scientific concept, wanting an agreed definition (Coffield, 2002). What seems to lack is an understanding of how it operates and can be recognised in individuals; in fact, most research mentioning this topic actually tackles other related concepts. A relevant policy initiative followed the 2018 review of Key Competences: the development of a European reference framework for the Personal, Social and Learning to Learn Competence. What is its rationale, and where does it stand against theory? How can learners and practitioners benefit from it? This article aims to offer theory and policy insights, working towards a mature definition of learning to learn embracing personal and social aspects. With a key pedagogical focus for deploying this competence in practice, it proposes an informed, actionable developmental model of how this complex set of knowledge, skills and attitudes can operate along key life stages. After all, there's nothing so practical as a good theory (Lewin, 1951). © 2020 Elsevier Doyma. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The paper presents a review of the process of inclusion of ‘civic education’ as part of the formal education system in the Republic of Macedonia, from its beginnings as project activity in the late 1990’s to its current implementation as a mandatory subject in the primary grades. Comparison is made between what was initially planned and what has been achieved in the area of civic education during this 20-year period, with a critical review on the potential of the subject for developing civic competencies. Methodology: The findings are based on content-analysis of curriculum goals and textbook tasks, through their classification in an indicators’ matrix of ‘Civic Key Competencies’ (as defined by the EC’s key competence framework for lifelong learning). Findings: The analysis provides insight into the frequency of curriculum goals and textbook tasks which relate to manifesting ‘civic competencies, from ‘knowledge’, ‘skills’, ‘attitudes’ and ‘values’, to the ‘behavior’ indicators, which should ideally be the goal of civic education. Research limitations/implications: The research was based on the method of textual analysis, which is inherently open to individual interpretations by the researcher. However, in order to limit arbitrary interpretations and classification of textual information, variables were operationalized on the basis of the indicators of Civic Key Competences (Appendix 1). Practical implications: Bearing in mind that the country is in the process of revising the civic education curriculum for primary and secondary school, the research has the potential to inform the policy process through providing viable recommendations on the most effective models for developing active citizens. © 2019, sowi-online e.V..

AB  - To realize competence-based education in the university, the goals of the curriculum should be described according to competence, while measurement and performance should be managed using appropriate core competence diagnostic tools. The purpose of this study is therefore to identify and explore the improvement directions of curriculum through core competence diagnosis. To achieve this, preliminary and follow-up surveys were conducted using offline questionnaires with students in the Department of Library and Information Science. According to the results of the analysis of this core competence diagnosis, the weakest competence was glocal competence, which was found to be statistically significant (t = 9.095, p <.000). Among the four sub-factors of glocal competence, the ability to use foreign languages was the least developed (t = − 25.286, p <.0001). There is a need to promote a variety of experiences and organize a program that develops confidence in students to converse with foreigners or to write what they wish in a foreign language. The result of the analysis of differences in the individual core competencies of Library and Information Science students showed that 33 (82.5%) of 40 students had a statistically significant difference in student competence, indicating that student learning core competence had somewhat improved. This study analyzed the difference in awareness of core competence through pre- and post-diagnosis using the self-core-competence measurement tool. By exploring, developing, and providing customized curriculum according to student needs based on this tool, it is expected that self-directed student participation and core competence can be increased. © 2019, De La Salle University.

AB  - An expanded investment in interdisciplinary research has prompted greater demands to integrate knowledge across disciplinary boundaries. Vision and Change similarly made interdisciplinary expectations a key competency for undergraduate biology majors; however, we are not yet synchronized on the meaning of interdisciplinarity, making this benchmark difficult to meet and assess. Here, we discuss aspects of interdisciplinarity through a historical lens and address various institutional barriers to interdisciplinary work. In an effort to forge a unified path forward, we provide a working definition of interdisciplinary science derived from both the perspectives of science faculty members and scientific organizations. We leveraged the existing literature and our proposed definition to build a conceptual model for an Interdisciplinary Science Framework to be used as a guide for developing and assessing interdisciplinary efforts in undergraduate science education. We believe this will provide a foundation from which the community can develop learning outcomes, activities, and measurements to help students meet the Vision and Change core competency of “tapping into the interdisciplinary nature of science.”. © 2019 B.

AB  - Introduction. This study focuses on intercultural competence of students of international relations and aims to determine the characteristics of intercultural competence in the group of Russian male and female students of international relations. Methods. The ideas of the Council of Europe document on key competencies underlying the culture of democracy were the source material for the study of intercultural competence. We interviewed 54 students of international relations aged 17–23 years using the technique of M. Barrett who operationalized this conceptual model of the Council of Europe. This paper represents a first effort in comparing the factor structure of theoretical and empirical models of Russian respondents’ intercultural competence (taking into account their gender) in relation to their values, behavioral attitudes, practical skills, and knowledge necessary for intercultural interaction. Results. The study involving Russian respondents confirmed the hypothesis that there are no differences in the number of factors in the theoretical and empirical models of intercultural competence. In the group of Russian female students the rating of factors of intercultural competence was as follows: 1 – practical skills, 2 – tolerance, 3 – empathy, and 4 – civic consciousness. In the group of Russian male students the rating of factors of intercultural competence was as follows: 1 – respect and responsibility, 2 – adaptability, 3 – empathy, and 4 – tolerance. Discussion. The findings obtained from the Russian sample suggest that while maintaining the four-factor structure in the theoretical and empirical models of intercultural competence, the content of factors differs significantly from the theoretical model. In our research, the respondents showed semantic and instrumental diversity in the components of intercultural competence. Women associate the success of intercultural interaction with skills, self-education, skills for listening and understanding, willingness to cooperate, and tolerance. For men, the success of intercultural interaction depends on respect and responsibility, adaptability, knowledge and its critical understanding. The conceptual model for the development of intercultural competence should be improved taking into account gender and professional characteristics of students and should be implemented in educational programs. © 2020, Russsian Psychological Society.

AB  - The ability to spell words correctly is a key competence for educational and professional achievement. Economical procedures are essential to identifying children with spelling problems as early as possible. Given the strong evidence showing that reading and spelling are based on the same orthographic knowledge, error-detection tasks (EDTs) could be considered such an economical procedure. Although EDTs are widely used in English-speaking countries, the few studies in German-speaking countries investigated only pupils in secondary school. The present study investigated N = 1,513 children in elementary school. We predicted spelling competencies (measured by dictation or gap-fill dictation) based on an EDT via linear regression. Error-detection abilities significantly predicted spelling competencies (Rbetween .509 and .679), indicating a strong connection. Predictive values in identifying children with poor spelling abilities with an EDT proved to be sufficient. Error detection for the assessment of spelling skills is therefore a valid instrument for transparent languages as well. © 2020 Hogrefe Verlag GmbH & Co. KG. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although information and communication technology (ICT) literacy is a key competence for students in the 21st century, most scholars only focus on ICT literacy in higher education and vocational education, while neglecting to discuss this competence on primary education. Given that it is not clear how various level factors affect primary school students' ICT literacy, this study conducted a multilevel analysis to examine the possible factors influencing primary school students’ ICT literacy. The data was released by Taiwan's administrative department in 2013, and the valid sample number is 943 students (including one of their parents) and 89 school deans. The results showed that: 1) The variables at student-level including gender, self-efficacy, ICT application in spare time and family salary income were significantly related to students' ICT literacy; 2) At the school-level, the larger the school size was, the higher the students' ICT literacy was. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Clinical reasoning skills are considered to be among the key competencies a physiotherapist should possess. Yet, we know little about how physiotherapy students actually learn these skills in the workplace. A better understanding will benefit physiotherapy education. Objectives: To explore how undergraduate physiotherapy students learn clinical reasoning skills during placements. Design: A qualitative research design using focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Setting: European School of Physiotherapy, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Participants: Twenty-two undergraduate physiotherapy students and eight clinical teachers participated in this study. Main outcome measures: Thematic analysis of focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Results: Three overarching factors appeared to influence the process of learning clinical reasoning skills: the learning environment, the clinical teacher and the student. Preclinical training failed to adequately prepare students for clinical practice, which expected them to integrate physiotherapeutic knowledge and skills into a cyclic reasoning process. Students’ basic knowledge and assessment structure therefore required further development during the placements. Clinical teachers expected a holistic, multifactorial problem-solving approach from their students. Both students and teachers considered feedback and reflection essential to clinical learning. Barriers to learning experienced by students included time constraints, limited patient exposure and patient communication. Conclusions: Undergraduate physiotherapy students develop clinical reasoning skills through comparison of and reflection on different reasoning approaches observed in professional therapists. Over time, students learn to synthesise these different approaches into their own individual approach. Physiotherapy programme developers should aim to include a wide variety of multidisciplinary settings and patient categories in their clinical placements. © 2018 King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences

AB  - Learning to learn (LTL) is a key competence (European Commission [EC], 2006, 2018). Building it into the educational system requires a solid theoretical model that researchers share, but there is currently a lack of agreement among academics. This work aims to check the theoretical model proposed by the research team against the opinions of key informants. This model has five dimensions — cognitive, metacognitive, affective-motivational, social-relational,andethical—aswellastwentysub-dimensions. The first three dimensions come from the literature about strategic and self-regulated learning and have been present since research into this topic began. The fourth comes from the social-cognitive approach and has more recently been added into explanatory models. The fifth one is an original contribution by this group. Our research focusses on the university setting and the aim of the present work is to verify our model with some of the key informants involved in the process (students, teachers, professionals, and employers). A qualitative methodology was used, featuring twelve discussion groups, one for each group in the three participating universities (N = 67). The participants were asked a general question about LTL and then their contributions were recorded. These contributions were then transcribed and processed using Atlas ti.8. to compare them with the theoretical model. The presence and importance of established dimensions and subdi-mensions was analysed, considering the frequency of comments and their connections and interre-lationships. The results corroborated the model proposed by the research team: all the dimensions and almost all of the subdimensions appeared in the participants’ comments. The next stage in the research process is to develop a standardised assessment instrument, based on the model, so it can be statistically validated with university students. © 2020, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

AB  - The link between identity and creativity has received surprisingly little attention from developmental psychology researchers, although flexibility and the ability to generate multiple solutions to problems are key competences for contemporary society based on continuous innovation and de-standardization of development trajectories. These competences are critical for identity formation processes, mainly during late adolescence when young people have to explore and commit to defining themselves. This study was concerned with exploring the relationships between creative and identity processes to identify typologies of ‘creativity-identity interplay’ in late adolescence. The participants comprised 315 late adolescents attending the last 2 years of Italian high schools. Two self-report measures were used: Utrecht-Management of Identity Commitments Scale and Test of Divergent Feeling. Participation was voluntary and anonymity was guaranteed. Our findings confirm the relationship between identity and creativity, identify six identity statuses (moratorium, critical exploration, achievement, early closure, diffusion, and searching moratorium), and they describe differences in terms of creativity processes involved in identity formation. Suggestions for future research and limitations are discussed. © 2017 by the Creative Education Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Visual media and virtual reality are now a common features of distance education environments. This has boosted research into questions surrounding visual media and technologies for educators’ professional development and teaching practice. This research explored educators’ views on identity and teaching presence in visual media in distance education. We interviewed 18 experienced educators and categorized their views on identity and visual media. The findings suggest that digital identity can be seen through the lens of networks with others, and that transmedia identity management, which we define as the ability to create and manage multiple identities across different technology platforms, is a key competence for online educators as a means of building trust within online learning communities. As a result, we modified the theory of tele-proximity (Themelis, 2013, 2014; Themeli & Bougia, 2016) by refining its concept of tele-teacher presence to include transmedia identity management. The implications for practice are that the professional development of online educators should include knowledge and competence in tele-teacher presence and especially transmedia identity management. © 2020, © 2020 Open and Distance Learning Association of Australia, Inc.

AB  - Within an increasingly technological framework, digital competence has become consolidated in all educational settings as a key competence for guaranteeing the formation of active citizens. The objective of the present study was to understand the important role played by schools, teaching staff and students involved in leisure and free-time courses with regards to digital competence. The research centred on the impact of the dimensions of this competence and their relevance for the construction of a competence profile in the socio-cultural setting. A sample of 25 schools, 95 training providers and 350 students of supervised leisure and free-time courses distributed throughout Spain participated. A quantitative study was carried out which was descriptive and inferential in nature. Three ad hoc questionnaires were used to identify the extent of incorporation of digital competences, and to determine the knowledge and predisposition of professionals towards incorporating technologies into socio-cultural animation content and methodology. Amongst the main findings it is evidenced that, whilst the acquisition of digital competence is considered necessary at a general level, resistance can be seen to competency and methodological changes in the socio-cultural setting. Objection exists to the incorporation of technology through specific content and concrete methods, with the greatest resistance being seen on behalf of schools, followed by training providers and, finally, students on these courses.

AB  - Regular class observations are one of the means to monitor factors and dynamics that influence quality learning. From 2016, the Rwanda education system introduced a new curriculum known as Competence-Based Curriculum (CBC), which ensures fosters more the learner-centered approach. This study was carried out to assess CBC input after four years of implementation. For this assessment, the reformed teaching observation protocol (RTOP) was used to observe 42 classes from 17 classrooms taught by nine teachers from the eastern province and Kigali city in Rwanda. Outcomes of our analysis indicated that after four years of CBC implementation, learners’ active participation has improved. The overall aggregate scores of observed lessons were 2.16 out of 4 ratings (54%) across all the 25 RTOP statements. Grouping the RTOP statements into six factors, learner-centered physics class is practiced at a 61% level while the overall reformed physics class is at a level of 53%. The results of this study led us to formulate some recommendations that would more improve physics students’ active learning. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

AB  - This paper explores the question how to approach thinking about curriculum construction for European engineering schools in the age of sustainable development. We present a theoretical argument that curriculum thinkers need to broaden their focus from the “restricted competences” paradigm (RCP) in curriculum thinking to consider how to make curricula within a diversifying competences paradigm (DCP). We claim that the best response to the challenge of sustainability is to produce more skill-diversity among engineers while simultaneously training engineers to make the most of this diversity. We support this claim with two arguments. First, we explore the problem-solving power of diversely skilled collectives, suggesting that this increases relative to homogenous collectives when confronting complex problems. Then we show that sustainable development is not only a complex problem, but an extremely complex or wicked problem. Based on these two conclusions, we propose a mixed-medium curricular model which illustrates how engineering schools might be reformed in order to produce greater student competence diversification. © 2020 Infonia.

AB  - There is little argument about the need for sustainability. Organizations around the world have now understood their role in contributing to the broader goals of, environmental and social sustainability. While financial sustainability of the organization has always been the key purpose. In order to identify, implement and promote sustainable practices, the leadership support is critical. This not only includes the current set of leaders but the future leaders of the organization as well. Thus, there arises a need to identify the key competencies and skills that contribute to effective leadership and to ensure that the training of future leaders focuses on the same. The current paper reviews theories in the area of Leadership and their evolution. Based on the proposition by key theorists in the area of leadership, the proposed theoretical framework links the dimensions of effective leadership to the dimensions of emotional intelligence. The purpose of the study was to establish a theoretical relationship between Emotional Intelligence, Effective leadership and sustainability. The proposed model is based on existing theories in the respective areas and the researchers hope that future research would work to provide empirical evidence for the same. This would ensure that the leadership pipeline is designed to promote the skills required to create and run a sustainable organization. © 2020 IJSTR.

AB  - Although collaborative care was adopted in several countries, including Canada, to improve the health and social services system, partnerships are often experienced as challenging. In many cases, transformative partnership remains a political rhetoric rather than a practical reality. This article presents an analysis of partnership relationships in youth mental health (YMH) using insights from game theory and a qualitative analysis of interactions during transcultural interinstitutional and interdisciplinary case discussion seminars (TIICDSs). Drawing on the analysis of 40 seminar sessions and six focus groups with seminar participants conducted in Montréal (Canada) between October 2013 and April 2015, this article interrogates the conditions and processes present in TIICDSs that contribute to building and strengthening YMH partnerships, examining how tensions among TIICDS participants are attended to. Research results indicate that TIICDSs can be seen as a game operating under different rules than real-life clinical work. They are characterized by the establishment of a climate of trust and respect, a high value placed on diversity and creativity, a concern for affects and power dynamics, a process of inclusive dialogue and negotiation, and a consideration for continuity. The game rules allow participants to safely apprehend a situation from a different perspective, a key competence in intercultural and collaborative YMH care. Results also indicate that participants complexify their representations by playing with divergent perceptions of people and situations and that enhanced case formulations are collective game outcomes. In light of our findings, tensions in collaborations can be seen as constituting both obstacles that can be counterproductive if not attended to, as well as powerful and useful learning tools that, under certain conditions, can support the clinical process and contribute to partnership building. Some clinical and partnership impasses may be overcome through clinical case discussions that allow partners to address these tensions and negotiate power relationships. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In 2017, the authors published an article describing the experiences of Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) as it adapted to new challenges of changing payment models, the imperative to manage the health of populations, and the desire to compete for statewide contracts. The authors described Propel Health, a multi-institution partnership created in 2013 to deliver the tools, methods, and support necessary for population health management. In the ensuing two years there were considerable changes to the structure and mission of Propel Health, ultimately resulting in its dissolution in January 2018. Using the organizational framework from the original publication, this article shares a number of lessons learned with other academic medical centers as they make the journey toward value-based care and population health management. Examples of lessons learned include ensuring that clinical and administrative leadership are aligned and that shared partnership goals are not eclipsed by local strategic needs. The potential for shared data remains a powerful motivation to partner; however, technology integration can be costly and complex. Once data are available, the ability to respond quickly is a key competency. Understanding individual sites' needs and capabilities is critical before embarking on shared clinical programs. Best practices from industry-specific experts should be employed. Lastly, it is essential for partners to determine how shared gains/losses will be attributed, and how aggressively risk should be required. Next steps for OHSU, including new, local partnerships, are shared. Copyright © 2019 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.

AB  - Theory and research in the field of competence-based vocational education (CBVE) have advanced enormously during the last decades, although empirical research on CBVE lags far behind. CBVE researchers have complained about the lack of evidence that CBVE results in better competence development, the decreasing attention for knowledge development in CBVE practice, and the cross-sectional nature of much CBVE research. This study addresses these issues by reviewing a worldwide competence-based education literature and comparing competence and knowledge development of students in vocational schools in Indonesia that have implemented principles of CBVE to a higher or lesser degree. The study involved 506 students majoring in food processing and technology and 32 teachers from 11 agricultural secondary vocational schools. Teachers and students rated student competence levels. Student knowledge was assessed with a multiple-choice test. Longitudinal data were collected during one school year at three points of time. Student competence development in high-CBVE was higher than in low-CBVE, suggesting that the implementation of CBVE was successful and had a motivating effect of both students and teachers in Indonesian vocational schools. However, knowledge development was indeed lower in high-CBVE than in low-CBVE, which needs further attention. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Some of the new teaching models that have emerged, including the Flipped Classroom, can be key to reversing traditional educational practices. However, it is necessary to analyse in detail how these educational experiences are being implemented in the classroom, and how this is affecting students' learning. The present research uses a case study methodology. The objective is to analyse a higher education course taught using flipped classroom methodology and to assess the impact of the implementation of said pedagogical model on the students' formative process. The study used a data collection instrument based on a structured interview and a data analysis strategy based on the Grounded Theory. In general, the results show that students tend to express positive opinions and a good degree of satisfaction with their experiences with this pedagogical method. Most students confirm that the method successfully stimulates cooperative learning and favours the practical acquisition of knowledge, stimulating in turn the development of a series of key competences in the educational process, along with capabilities such as organisation, autonomy and responsibility, among others. © 2019 Facultat de Psicologia, Ciencies de l'Educacio i de l'Esport Blanquerna.

AB  - The Decree of August 10, 2007 (normative development LOE) establishes that students had to learn only one foreign language with a class schedule which exceeded 4 hours per week in each of the cycles. However, the Decree of March 17, 2015 (normative development LOMCE) collects up to a second foreign language and with a direct teaching load of language lessons higher than twice the previous regulations. In addition, the curricular development map in this last law presents the evaluation criteria of each of the cycle and their relation to the rest of the curricular elements. It does not have as a reference the contents for the whole curriculum development, as in the LOE. In this respect, although the trend of teaching foreign languages in Andalusia follows very ambitious patterns through the development of their curricula from the LOE to the LOMCE, it prioritizes the development of skills at the expense of the accumulation of content. This teaching intent is a big step towards another dimension in the way of acquiring key competences. © 2020, Universidad Pablo de Olavide. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Socially-accountable health professional education (SAHPE) is committed to achieving health equity through training health-workers to meet local health needs and serve disadvantaged populations. This research assesses the biomedical and socially-accountable competencies and work-readiness of first year graduates from socially-accountable medical schools in Australia, the United States and Sudan. Method: A self-administered survey to hospital and community health facility staff closely associated with the training and/or supervision of first year medical graduates from three SAHPE medical schools. Main outcome measure: Likert scale ratings of key competencies of SAHPE graduates (as a group) employed as first-year doctors, compared to first year doctors from other medical schools in that country (as a group). Findings: Supervisors rated medical graduates from the 3 SAHPE schools highly for socially-accountable competencies (‘communication skills’, ‘teamwork’, ‘professionalism’, ‘work-readiness’, ‘commitment to practise in rural communities’, ‘commitment to practise with underserved ethnic and cultural populations’), as well as ‘overall performance’ and ‘overall clinical skills’. Interpretation: These findings suggest SAHPE medical graduates are well regarded by their immediate hospital supervisors, and SAHPE can produce a medical workforce as competent as from more traditional medical schools, but with greater commitment to health equity, working with underserved populations, and addressing local health needs. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Five years after proclamation of the Sustainable Development Goals promoted by the United Nations, Spain joined this process of transforming the world socially, economically, and environmentally. This research covers the route taken and results obtained during subsequent years in Spain and proposes, as a general objective, to observe whether it is feasible to work in the technical drawing classroom on an eco-urban project, following the learning approach and method proposed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2017 Education for Sustainable Development Goals: Learning objectives, in order to reinforce cognitive, socio-emotional, and behavioral objectives, as well as the key competences established in Sustainable Development Goal 11. The phases of the project were related to the learning objectives and key competences, the results of which were complemented by a questionnaire that provided information on the sustainable consciousness of the students after completing the project, and could serve as a starting point for future educational projects. We agree with other authors, and in particular with UNESCO, that implementation of this type of project in the classroom is a key learning method for SDG. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Background: In peer-led tutorial courses, qualified medical students ("tutors") provide their peers with opportunities to deepen their theoretical knowledge effectively and to practice clinical skills already in preclinical semesters. At the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University, a structured medical didactic qualification programme prepares and trains future tutors for their responsibilities. This programme consists of four modules: 1. medical didactics and group leadership, 2. subject-specific training, 3. performance of tutorial courses as well as 4. collegial advice and reflection on the tutors' activities. The aim of this study is to systematically analyse and present the development of role competencies for medical tutors based on the CanMEDS Physician Competency Framework through the didactic qualification programme. Methods: We applied a qualitative research approach to detect CanMEDS role competencies acquisition within the tutor qualification programme. The CanMEDS framework describes key competencies, grouped thematically under seven professional roles. Two tutors and three training coordinators independently assigned the individual modules of the tutor qualification programme to the key competencies of the CanMEDS framework. Tutors and training coordinators compared and discussed the allocations within the groups in a consensus finding process. All authors analysed the findings in order to find out the so-called "hidden curriculum". The views of both groups are presented separately. Results: The training programme promotes the acquisition of competencies in all seven CanMEDS roles. The roles of the scholar and the leader are promoted in all modules. In addition, the first and fourth module focus predominately on the role of the collaborator, the second on the role of the medical expert and communicator, and the fourth on the role of the professional. Conclusions: The systematic analysis through assignment of the CanMEDS roles to the individual modules of the tutor qualification programme documents the comprehensive acquisition of competencies, not only with regard to the tutor activity, but generally with regard to the later role of the physician. The reflection on one's own competency acquisition can support the promotion of corresponding competencies in the qualification programme and their transfer into the professional practice later. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Digital competence is a transversal key competence increasingly required by the labour market as well as by the job search process itself, most of which has now shifted online. Individuals who have not developed the most basic digital technology skills are most at risk for long-term unemployment. We argue that to bridge the skills gap of digitally-excluded, unemployed citizens we should create a common understanding of what are the most essential digital competences they require, in particular, to solve their job seeking problems. The resulting conceptual framework should aim to facilitate the design of an elementary but comprehensive practical learning programme through which adult learners can readily develop self-efficacy using digital technologies. To fulfil this need, we provide a holistic framework within which ten essential digital competences for unemployed citizens are identified and contextualised. It is grounded on an analysis of generic digital competence frameworks and existing employability-enhancing digital training initiatives. The applicability of this new “basic digital competences” framework was tested using an iterative process of evaluation with practitioners involved in programmes for the unemployed, and through the design of a challenge-based learning project that provides a practical training model for the implementation of the framework in an integrated and transversal manner. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Intercultural communication is not only a necessary tool for most international workplaces, but also for higher education so as to better prepare students for their future jobs. To test how intercultural competences might be taught in engineering programmes in Spain, a country where many young people have to emigrate in order to find work, an experimental group of engineers was trained in the acquisition of intercultural competences, and compared to a control group in the same field. Students exposed to the intercultural content performed significantly better on later intercultural assessments. Pedagogical implications show that teaching intercultural skills in monoculture contexts is feasible. © 2019 SEFI.

AB  - In a narrative way, the article presents the background of the events that led to the inclusion of the discipline of authorial reading in the teaching of a particular lower basic school. The initial assumption is that authorial reading can be a suitable alternative to the development of key competencies in addition to the practice of stylistic units. Based on the obtained data, the main goal is to formulate one's own pedagogical experience at the school during an eightyear practice with authorial reading. The secondary goal is to use case studies to illustrate the ways in which specific students (and parents) can approach authorial reading. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Mobility and transnational migration are current social developments among the population of the European Union. These developments in both society-at-large and companies, linked to the challenges of sustainability, lead to new requirements for working in the European Union. Teaching and learning in higher education needs to adapt to these requirements. As a result, new and innovative teaching and learning practices in higher education should provide competencies for transnational teamwork in the curriculum of tomorrow's engineers in order to ensure their competitiveness in the job market. A transnational project-oriented teaching and learning framework, which provides the future key competencies for young engineers was implemented in the course European Engineering Team (EET). Engineering students from four countries participated in a new project-based course that focused on the development of innovative and sustainable products and opportunities. The goal of this paper is to present results and lessons learnt from three cohorts of EET. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Advanced skills in communication, teamwork and stakeholder engagement are widely recognized as important success factors for advancing sustainability. While project-based learning formats claim to advance such skills, there is little empirical evidence that demonstrates how interpersonal competence is being developed. This study aims to describe and explains teaching and learning processes of project-based sustainability courses that contribute to the development of interpersonal competence as one of the key competencies in sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: This study on an international project-based learning course adopted a multi-method case study approach, triangulating observations, semi-structured interviews and focus groups supported by Photovoice method through which students tracked their learning processes. Data collection and analysis followed a grounded theory approach. Findings: Learning through and from conflicts within a learning community can foster competence development in teamwork, communication and stakeholder engagement. This study identified inner and outer conflicts (within individuals versus between individuals or groups) as potential drivers of learning processes, depending on strategies applied to address these conflicts. Originality value: The value of this study is fourfold: it demonstrates how conflicts can be leveraged for students’ competence development; it provides in-depth empirical data from multiple perspectives, it discusses the findings in the context of teaching and learning theories, and it demonstrates an application of the Photovoice method to track and improve teaching and learning processes. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - There is significant global concern with current environmental problems, yet people’s behaviour towards the environment has been resistant to change. Young people have the opportunity to bring about desirable changes through environmental behaviours and attitudes. The goal of this study is to better understand the scope of nature relatedness as an attribution interacting with pro-environmental behaviours for Turkish pre-service early childhood teachers. We examined the associations between the domains representing nature relatedness and also sought to identify any differences in nature relatedness with respect to their year of enrolment in a teacher education program. The participants were 402 students attending an Early Childhood Teacher Education Program at one of the two public universities in the capital of Turkey. A Turkish-adapted version of the Nature Relatedness Scale developed by Nisbet, Zelenski, and Murphy was administered to gather the data. Participants were found to have a mostly positive external nature-related worldview. Furthermore, the statistical analysis indicated non-significant differences in their nature relatedness with respect to the year of enrolment in the teacher education program. In terms of the relationships between the constructs representing nature relatedness, the internalized identification with nature was positively correlated with two constructs which refer to his/her physical familiarity as well as attraction to nature, and how individual’s relationship with the environment is provoked by his/her behaviour. This research indicates that pre-service teachers, who are regarded as important agents for the future implementation of sustainability education, are actually lacking in their nature relatedness constructs and need to develop key competencies in a field that presupposes that they have already acquired sufficient experience of physical and emotional interaction with nature. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This qualitative study aims to explore teachers' beliefs about the specific English curriculum change from a content-based to a competence-based curriculum. The core problem of developing teaching materials for lesson plans is focused on. This study applies a qualitative approach with content analysis. The participants of this study were secondary school English teachers in Surakarta, Indonesia, all of who were involved in the Teacher Forum. A collection of 12 English-lesson plans and related teaching materials were evaluated. Data about the teachers' beliefs were collected through semi-structured interviews and checklists, which were analysed using thematic analysis. This study reveals that teachers believe that the curriculum changes have had a positive impact on the development of the teaching profession, relating to the core competences, standard competences, learning objectives, learning outcomes, teaching materials, Specifically, teachers' problems show that teachers are unable to develop the teaching materials and assessments required in the instructional design and link them to the learning outcomes. The findings of this study imply that future research should look at a larger number of participants and that the government should look at providing more practical training in implementing the K-13 curriculum, placing critical evaluation as a priority. © 2020 Asian EFL Journal Press.

AB  - Currently, linguistics (LING) courses are underrepresented in general education at most US universities. As general education requirements undergo reform in higher education, the field of linguistics has an opportunity to assume a more central role. We argue that linguistics courses aligned with the key competencies of critical thinking, information literacy, and inquiry and analysis are well positioned to augment general education curricula, particularly at institutions that uti-lize common student learning objectives. An innovative The Language of Now core course and its signature assignment, a learner-centered research project on the use of the text-messaging discourse marker lol, illustrate how the methods used in linguistic inquiry are amenable to a range of standards that support general education goals.*. © 2020, Linguistic Society of America.

AB  - Vietnamese higher education has been subjected to constant pressures and major changes in the last few decades so as to meet the country's needs for socio-economic development and to better prepare graduates for employment and personal growth. There has been greater recognition for the role of mid-level academic managers as key contributors to effective institutional performance and success. However, an understanding of what constitutes a competent mid-level academic manager, who are heads of faculties, departments, academic offices and specialized centers, for the context of Vietnam is limited. This study employs an exploratory and mixed-method approach to identify the core competencies required for mid-level academic managers at Vietnamese higher education institutions. Findings from focus group discussions and a survey conclude five professional domains for effective mid-level academic management and sustainable development yet, in the meantime, reveal the gap between institutional expectations and the actual competencies of academic heads as perceived by academic heads themselves, their supervisors and their team members. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Learning to learn is a key competence in the knowledge society. Regardless of popular considerations, university students need training for learning. Teachers require a robust and comprehensive theoretical model on this competence, which allows them to perform an effective curricular design in bachelor's degrees. We build a theoretical model more comprehensive and integrative than those available. We focused on scientific literature to establish the model, and particularly on two main research lines that support the 'learning to learn' construct: the information processing theory, from the cognitive psychology, and the socio-cognitive approach. This model contains five dimensions: cognitive, metacognitive, affective-motivational, social-relational, and ethical. Based on this model, we proposed teaching and assessment options with a constructive alignment approach and using authentic tasks. This approach may lead to an easy inclusion of this competence in the subjects of bachelor's degrees. We advocate an integrative method for its evaluation, considering the complexity of 'learning to learn' and using complementary assessment procedures. © 2020 Elsevier Doyma. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction:To support the development, implementation, and evaluation of shared decision-making (SDM) training programs, this article maps the relevant evidence in terms of training program design and content as well as evaluation outcomes.Method:A systematic scoping review methodology was used. To identify studies, the databases PubMed, Medline, and CINAHL were searched from 2009 to 2019, and reference lists of included studies were examined. After removal of duplicates, 1367 articles were screened for inclusion. To be included, studies were to be published in peer-reviewed journals, and should not merely be descriptive but report on evaluation outcomes. Articles were reviewed for inclusion by both authors, and data were extracted using a purposely designed data charting form implemented using REDCap.Results:The review identified 49 studies evaluating 36 unique SDM training programs. There was considerable variation in terms of program design and duration. Most programs included an overview of SDM theories and key competencies, as well as SDM skill development through role plays. Few programs provided training in reflective practice, in identifying and working with patients' individually preferred decision-making style, or in relation to SDM in a context of medical uncertainty or ambiguity. Most programs were evaluated descriptively, mostly using mixed methods, and there were 18 randomized controlled trials, showing that training was feasible, well received, and improved participants' knowledge and skills, but was limited in its impact on patients.Discussion:Although there is limited capacity to comment on which types of training programs are most effective, overall training was feasible, well received, and improved participants' knowledge and skills. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Competence-based education (CBE) is an innovation in (vocational) education aimed at improving students’ competences. Little is known, however, about the processes leading to successful implementation of CBE and about its outcomes. This study investigates the effects that the level of CBE implementation has on student satisfaction (regarding the quality of education, guidance, and the development of interpersonal and general vocational skills) and to what extent CBE implementation mediates the relationship between teacher team learning activities and student satisfaction. To this end, data was gathered from 662 teachers belonging to 46 teacher teams in senior secondary vocational education in the Netherlands, and their students. Multilevel structural equation modelling revealed that teacher team learning was positively associated with te implementation of CBE. Furthermore, CBE had a positive effect on student satisfaction with quality of education, guidance, and development of interpersonal skills; however, no significant effect was found on student satisfaction with the development of general vocational skills. These results indicate that implementation of CBE has, to some degree, fulfilled its promise of better preparing students for their future workplace and that teacher team learning can support the further implementation of CBE.

AB  - This study is the first to investigate and validate the psychometric properties of an Indonesian translation of the Student Performance Opportunity of Competence Development (SPOCD) questionnaire that covers five key competencies related to the mathematics learning process, namely: (1) thinking; (2) relating to others; (3) using language, symbols and text; (4) managing self, and; (5) participating and contributing. The SPOCD questionnaire comprises 30 items, with a 5-point Likert scale. A total of 1413 Indonesian high-school students (46.4% male, 53.6% female) from three regions (eastern, western and central Indonesia), aged from 16 to 19 years and ranging from the 10th to the 12th grade, completed the SPOCD questionnaire. A Rasch rating scale model (RSM) and confirmatory factor analysis were applied to evaluate the psychometric characteristics and factor structure of the SPOCD questionnaire. The results indicated that assumptions of unidimensionality, local independence and monotonicity of the SPOCD questionnaire were met. In the Rasch RSM assessment, the SPOCD questionnaire response set worked well, matched the threshold estimates and functioned as an appropriate model for the response categories. The SPOCD questionnaire showed excellent psychometric characteristics for use in measuring the development of competence in middle school students in Indonesia. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Pre-service Physical Education teacher training should develop key competencies that guide graduates in their professional work. The application of the formative assessment at this stage is presented as a way for them to acquire these competencies. This research assesses graduates’ perception of the development of key teaching competencies and whether there are significant differences depending on whether or not they are working as teachers. The relationship between some elements of assessment and grading and the development of competencies is also studied. Four hundred and eighty-seven graduates from seventeen Spanish universities participated. The results show that (a) there are no differences in the perception of the competencies acquired depending on whether or not graduates are working; (b) graduates who are working as teachers positively relate the assessment items to two of the three sets of competencies studied, and participative forms of grading to the competencies of development, application and assessment of teaching and learning processes in physical education; and (c) those who are working believe that using formative assessment during their pre-service training has helped them put the teaching competencies into practice in their professional work. © Copyright Generalitat de Catalunya (INEFC).

AB  - Purpose: This quantitative study sought to investigate the perceptions of teachers and students regarding competency-based education (CBE) principles at the College of Agriculture at Razi University. Design: This research is a comparative analysis of two groups. The first group consists of undergraduate and graduate students majoring in agriculture who are members and non-members of student cooperatives (n = 256). The second group consists of agricultural faculty members (n = 59). Findings: The results of this study show that students and teachers have different views with regard to the extent to which CBE principles are practiced in the College of Agriculture. Moreover, students with different learning patterns had different perceptions regarding the extent to which CBE is practiced, whereas teachers with different teaching patterns had the same perception of the application of CBE principles in the College of Agriculture. Practical implications: This study has practical implications for agricultural higher education in general and colleges of agriculture in particular. Colleges of agriculture across Iran could encourage their students to establish and engage in student cooperatives so that the ‘what’ and ‘how’ aspects of CBE are put into practice. Theoretical implications: This study has theoretical implications for CBE principles. For example, student cooperatives can be utilized by faculty members as one of the main strategies for developing CBE in agricultural colleges. Originality/value: This study is original in that it moves from theory to practice when considering CBE. © 2019, © 2019 Wageningen University.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to supplement existing research on a joint approach to integrate sustainability into higher planning education (HPE) by facilitating an international transformative learning process. It looks at three different urban master’s programs in Serbia (Belgrade) and Germany (Berlin and Stuttgart). Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, students' assessments of the pedagogical model, individual learning outcomes and the long-term value of the pedagogical model in respect of key competences for sustainability are presented and discussed. Basic assumptions of the study include that assessment from the students' perspective can provide feedback on the transformational learning experience with the aim of improving the experience and thus learning outcomes; help identify limitations and target specific areas for improvement in the pedagogical model; and improve the evaluation of effectiveness in developing knowledge and skills for sustainability in HPE. Findings: The paper provides evidence that a learner-centered and action-oriented approach, as well as a global dialogue among peers from different backgrounds and nationalities, is an effective way to educate future generations of urban planners to become “change agents” for societal transformation toward a more sustainable future within their respective contexts. Originality/value: The paper is a supplement to the existing research on educational initiatives that attempts to integrate sustainability into the curricula, especially of urban-related programs; showcases outcomes of the pedagogical model(s) for sustainable development applied, especially when addressing the competences of students working in developing, transitional and developed countries or different geographic contexts; and shows long-term learning outcomes after the students move into work practice. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Constructing school leaders as autonomous professionals through management and leadership training constitutes the first step to releasing their potential to improve school quality. Despite major gains by the Ministry of education in Rwanda, particularly training and recruitment of teachers and introduction of a coordination system to ensure professional development and management of teachers, the education sector is still challenged to ensure that (head) teachers have the capacity to lead and deliver the new competence based curriculum in schools. In this paper, we explore how a partnership established in 2014 between governmental and nongovernmental institutions led to the development and implementation of certified Continuous Professional Development (CPD) programs for the Rwandan education sector and present some preliminary findings. We apply the Kirkpatrick evaluation of training framework to present the different results that the CPD programs have brought about at the learning and behaviour change level. Data were composed of different monitoring and evaluation outputs and training assessments that have been produced by the program so far including focus group discussions and pre- and post-surveys on knowledge, attitudes and practices. The partnership has enabled Leaders in Education including Sector education officers, head (deputy) teachers, school based mentors and tutors from teacher training colleges to acquire new competencies for leading school as well as managing and implementing CPD activities at the sector and school levels. Furthermore, the initiated partnership which started with primary schools in 6 districts has grown and expanded to other partnerships with new development partners to upscale the program at secondary school level in 14 districts. This led us to suggest that the same initiatives could be replicated by other partners to enhance professional development of leaders in education in Rwanda or any other country. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Our inner, invisible dimension consisting of our values, mental models and worldviews, has been identified as a significant leverage point for transformational change, as it brings to life our actions. Accordingly, the inner dimension of sustainability has a major role in transitioning towards desirable and sustainable futures. This paper focuses on exploring what kind of methods and competences are needed to access and work with the inner dimension as part of collaborative design practices aiming for sustainable and deep change. Thus, a lesser researched, alternative perspective to design discourse, the awareness-based co-creation approach is highlighted as a potential and emerging direction for design for sustainability. By thinking across: (1) literature findings of the concept of inner dimension of sustainability; (2) existing knowledge of awareness-based transformation approaches and (3) results of an experimental case study done in the context of nature tourism, it was recognized that more examples are needed on how to enable, promote and capture participants' transformative experiences. Finally, the argument is made that awareness-based competencies should be considered as essential future skills and competences of design for sustainability. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The development of Learners’ Key Competencies (LKCs) is one of the goals of the basic education core curriculum that is currently being used in Thailand. Therefore, learning activities that enhance LKCs are essential for all teachers. The objectives of this research were to develop a Scientific Imagineering (SIG) learning activity through Facebook in enhancing LKC development and to study its effectiveness. A research and development method was used in this study. A total of 30 students of grade 11 which selected using purposive sampling participated in the learning activity. A self-assessment of LKCs form was used to investigate the situation in a physics class, before and after participation in the learning activity. The research results showed that SIG learning activity through Facebook consisted of six steps in the form of Imagine, Study, Design, Develop, Present, and Evaluate. The evaluation results by five experts concerning the suitability of this learning activity indicated that it could be used to enhance LKCs and had great potential to be implemented. Comparing the students’ self-assessment with regard to LKCs, it was clear that there was a significant overall increase (p<.05). The comparison of students’ self-assessment to the LKCs for each component also found that the skills of communication, thinking and learning, problem-solving, and technological application increased significantly (p<.05). The results of this study support the view that SIG learning activity through Facebook could enhance the LKCs of students. © 2019 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe the design and development of a final year undergraduate mathematics module designed to address professional skills development at a UK university, including via input to curriculum and assessment from employers, and to investigate student acquisition of skills from this module. Design/methodology/approach: Literature on skills development in mathematics informs module design and development. Students optionally completed Likert-style competency questionnaires before and after the taught module content, and reflected on skills development via an end of module questionnaire. Data collection took place over three academic years. Findings: Several key competencies exhibit median increases over the course of the module in each academic year, indicating a perceived skills development. Problem solving and presentation skills are particularly highlighted. Research limitations/implications: Numbers of students were small, though the study is repeated with three different cohorts. Some students study mathematics jointly with another discipline and hence may have experience in skills development from the other subject. Practical implications: This study indicates that innovations in teaching style and assessment in mathematics modules can enhance student confidence and competence with key professional skills. Originality/value: Undergraduate modules in mathematics which have a focus on professional skills development are still fairly rare in UK universities. Often such modules do not embed the professional skills development activities with subject-specific technical tasks and projects as this module does. There are few formal studies of the effectiveness of this style of module, especially longitudinal studies covering several academic years. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to reveal the essence of innovations and their application in teaching in connection with the student’s educational outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: The sample of the study consists of 588 third-year students of the I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University. The paper describes the use of innovations in teaching in the context of the competence-activity approach, which implements the psychological process of learning of social experience in the practice of education. Findings: This paper reflects the content of a scientific research on a relevant topic in the field of modern education – the implementation of four innovations in teaching, the guarantee that each student masters the educational outcomes that meet the requirements of the Bologna Declaration to the quality of training of graduates and the development of competence-based education ideas. The paper presents the learning and professional activities that focus on constructing a mental image of educational outcomes in the student’s mind and independent training that focus on automating the student’s activity, with a view to solving the practical tasks of modeling socio-professional situations on the basis of the mental image in the mind. Research limitations/implications: There are some limitations with this research. The sample is small and this makes broad generalization difficult. In total, 588 participants (both Russian and foreign) from 611 upper-year medical students of State Medical University were involved in research work. This may have functioned as a measurement ceiling. With that, all the proposed tools are universal. The authors tried to describe their specific in as much detail as possible. The findings are also consistent with the urgent publications of researchers in the field. Thus, the authors believe there will be no problems with their implementation in other medical universities. Practical implications: The practical value of the study is that it shows medical university professors a model of teaching activities, which guarantees that each student achieves educational outcomes of the planned quality. Originality/value: The authors propose new didactic means, which help to manage each student’s activities according to individual educational trajectory. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper investigates the realisation of competence-based education (CBE) in vocational education in Indonesia. It examines the extent to which CBE design principles of the Comprehensive Competence-Based Education Framework developed in a Western context exist in Indonesian policy documents and school practices. This study reviews educational policy documents and collects cross-sectional survey data from 41 school principals, 453 teachers, and 2219 students from 41 agricultural vocational schools in five provinces of Java, Indonesia. Results showed that the ten CCBE principles listed in the framework exist to large extent in Indonesian policy documents. School principals, teachers, and students noticed the realisation of CCBE principles in the study programme to differing degrees, except for the principle of flexibility that was largely absent. The level of CBE implementation varied, from the level of starting competence-based to that of largely competence-based education. The findings contribute to the discussion of CCBE design principles and lesson learned of CBE implementation in a non-western perspective. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The rapidly changing workforce of the C21st places increasing demands on higher education institutions to produce graduates who possess sound academic credentials and key skills, and who furthermore demonstrate the ability to transfer knowledge and skills from their studies to the workplace. This paper begins with a definition of key/core skills, followed by a discussion of how they relate to transferable skills. A review of literature regarding the transference of skills from tertiary settings to workplaces in South-East Asia reveals that most literature of the region addresses key competencies rather than the transferable skills that employers value. Transferable skills are further analysed in the context of networked spaces of learning and the theory of connectivist learning. A case study of one networked classroom (NC) of an Australian university in Singapore is presented, highlighting how engagement in problem-based and project-based learning contributes to the development of transferable skills. Results indicate that the spatial and material resources of the NC intersect with practice-based learning experiences assisting students in skills acquisition by providing a teaching and learning space in which to apply transferable skills. Implications of this study point to the need for further research regarding embedding transferable skills within higher education curricula. © 2019, © 2019 National Institute of Education, Singapore.

AB  - Learning to learn (L2L) is one of key competencies in the knowledge society. Given its recognised importance, many countries have included it in their national curriculum. To date, little is known as to whether teachers are promoting this competence in classrooms. This qualitative exploratory research investigated whether preschool teachers in participating countries favoured L2L through their teaching practices. It identified similarities and differences between participating countries. Participants included 23 preschool teachers: 5 in Italy, 4 in Mexico, 10 in Spain and 4 in Uruguay. We used semi-structured interviews and performed content analysis to identify the L2L elements fostered by teachers. We matched these elements with the theoretical dimensions of our conceptual framework. We found that participating teachers report a variety of activities to foster this competency. Most activities promoted elements of more than one dimension of L2L. We observed cross-country differences both in the predominance of activities and in the pedagogical objectives pursued with them. Participants in countries with a curriculum promoting L2L (Italy and Spain) reported implementing more practices and favoured more L2L elements than countries where guidelines to promote such competence do not exist or are not clear (Mexico and Uruguay). © 2020 Elsevier Doyma.

AB  - Background: Communication and empathy are considered as key competences in the care of persons with dementia. Virtual reality might be an effective intervention to train informal and professional caregivers of persons with dementia in order to improve their communication skills and empathy. Objectives: The aim of this study was to map the use and impact of virtual reality simulation in dementia care education. Method: A scoping review was performed. Studies with all types of qualitative or quantitative design published since 2007 in English, French or German were included if a virtual reality intervention was examined in a dementia care education setting (e.g. nursing school, caregiver training). The literature search was conducted in six databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, ERIC, and Inspec), including an additional hand search as well as backward and forward citation tracking of included studies. Charted data was narratively reported by clustering results according to study characteristics and impact of virtual reality. Results: The review process resulted in the inclusion of six studies published between 2012 and 2017. Two of them are ongoing studies. Three studies had a one group pre-post-test design and in one study a post-test only design was applied. The samples consisted of caregivers of people with dementia as well as students and varied in size between seven and 126. Eight different outcomes were measured, e.g. empathy, competence, and stress. Interventions resulted in improvements of caregivers' and students' empathy and competences among other outcomes. Conclusions: No studies with controlled design and group comparisons are available yet. There are some indications that virtual reality might be an effective intervention to train caregivers of persons with dementia. Little is known about the use and impact of virtual reality in dementia-related education. Since studies are rare and do not address effectiveness, the findings of this review can substantially contribute to guide further research on this topic. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: As one of the eight key competencies of life-long learning strategies identified by the European Union and the difficulties in enhancing the “sense of initiative and entrepreneurship”, the purpose of this paper is to propose a co-production approach to overcome several concerns. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory approach is used to analyse a single case study based on the EntreComp progression model and on a pedagogical approach consistent with the philosophy of learning through creating value for others. Findings: The study introduces best novel practices that help enhance entrepreneurial education in primary school by engaging multiple local stakeholders in co-producing education. The case mainly shows that a co-production approach is appropriate to overcome challenges and assists policymakers to identify specific actions and make investments in entrepreneurship education (EE) at the primary level. Research limitations/implications: Theoretically, the study contributes to literature on entrepreneurial education and co-production studies. The main drawback of the study is its explorative analysis of a single case. Practical implications: For practitioners, the research proposes stakeholder involvement as key to co-producing EE in primary schools, implying that policymakers should identify resources for projects and other similar initiatives. Originality/value: The study elucidates the relevance of co-production approach to ensure early EE in school. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The need to develop an integrative readiness of future specialists is a relevant scientific problem. The reasons for this could be based on the fact that that the specialists-to-be were expected to be involved in the fierce competition for vacancies and areas of activity, have modern information and communication tools, i.e. have an integrative readiness for professional activity. Institutions do not, however, have a single integration (interdisciplinary) framework for training, do not provide a comprehensive educational information, technical tools, strategies and technologies of education, reasoned psychological and pedagogical conditions. According to the author, the integrative readiness of future specialists for professional activity is a system-personality formation that reflects the unity of theoretical and managerial training and practical ability of students to comprehensively apply regulatory, socio-economic, psychological and pedagogical methods and technologies for solving different problems. This readiness reflects the unity of the motivational inclination of future specialists to professional activity and knowledge of practical technologies for solving a wide range of professional problems in personal and business interactions. The research methodology is based on the concept of key competence, which provides systematization, classification of significant problems, development of a matrix of significant problems, and determination of overall strategy, management technology of professional training development process. Students and teachers can use research materials can be used by in educational and practical activities; developers of content, organizational forms and methods of professional training to improve the practical component of curricula and standards of their development. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Asian Online Journal Publishing Group

AB  - The aim of this article is to present the main assumptions about design studios as held in the Faculty of Architecture at Gdansk University of Technology (FA-GUT), Gdansk, Poland, adapted to the development of key competencies in the urban planning of complex urban structures. One of these competencies is the design of public spaces. The main goal of the studios was to deliver knowledge of the role of public spaces in the design of complex urban structures. During the studios, students learned the need for a systematic approach with various specialists in improving the quality of urban structures. An overview is given of the findings from the urban design studios held, as well as the competencies gained by students. The major conclusion is that teaching the ability to design public spaces connecting urban structures gives students opportunities to better understand complex urban circumstances, as well as offering new challenges in urban planning. © 2020 WIETE.

AB  - The chef is considered a success factor for culinary tourism. Hence, mastering the chefs’ key competencies through culinary schools is very important. Many studies have examined chef competencies, but we have not yet discovered how to measure the chefs’ key competencies according to culinary student perceptions. This study involved 392 culinary students in public vocational high schools. Data was collected by proportional random sampling through a questionnaire distributed to seven public vocational schools in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Questionnaire validation used three techniques, namely, content validity test with Aiken V analysis, small sample validity test with Pearson correlation analysis, and finally, CFA analysis. This study shows that culinary students' perceptions of chefs’ key competencies can be explained by indicators of creativity, culinary skills, hygiene & food safety, aesthetics, business sense, interpersonal, managerial, and leadership. Chefs’ Key Competencies Questionnaire (CKCQ) consists of 30 items consisting of creative (3 items), culinary skills (5 items), hygiene & food safety (4 items), aesthetics (2 items), business sense (4 items), interpersonal (3 items), managerial (4 items), and leadership (5 items). All items (30 items) have good validity and reliability values. The findings of this study discuss in-depth and some implications for vocational education practitioners proposed for further improvement. VET practitioners can also use this questionnaire to evaluate the achievement of the chefs’ key competencies of culinary students and professional chefs. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publishers’ Office.

AB  - Background: Focused history taking, knowledge-based clinical reasoning, and adequate case presentation during hand-offs represent important facets of competence of practicing physicians. Based on a validated 360-degree assessment simulating a first day of residency we developed a training for final-year medical students including patient consultation, patient management, and patient hand-off. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the training was changed to a telemedicine format and evaluated. Methods: In 2019, 103 final-year students participated in a newly de-signed competence-based training including a consultation hour with simulated patients, a patient management phase with an electronic patient chart, and a case presentation in hand-off format. Due to social distancing regulations, the training was not allowed to take place in this way. Therefore, we changed the training to a telemedicine format. In May 2020, 32 students participated in the telemedicine training. A 5-point Likert scale (1: does not apply to 5: fully applies) was used for the evaluation items. The two formats were compared with t-tests. Results: The students were similarly satisfied with the content of the training independently of its format. Both groups found the patient cases interesting (presence: 4.68 ± 0.49, telemedicine: 4.66 ± 0.48). With respect to the telemedicine format, participants were glad that an option had been found that could be offered throughout the final year (4.94 ± 0.24) despite the COVID-19 pandemic and they regarded it as a very useful training for their final examination (4.94 ± 0.24). Conclusion: The telemedicine format of the competence-based training worked as well as the presence format. In its telemedicine format, the training can be offered to students independently of their location. © 2020 Harendza et al.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims at determining the competencies of Korean nurses in prenatal genetic nursing. Methods: First, a 3-round Delphi survey was conducted to establish prenatal genetic nursing competencies. Second, a prenatal genetic nursing education program (PGNEP), incorporating the findings from the Delphi survey, was designed. Third, a single group pre- and post-quasi-experimental study at a PGNEP workshop was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the integration of the competencies into the PGNEP with the measurements of knowledge about prenatal genetic testing and nursing (K-PGTN) and information needs about prenatal genetic testing and nursing (I-PGTN). Finally, the identified competencies were reexamined for their clarity. Results: Based on the Delphi survey 78 competency components were identified. The components were then classified under 10 categories, which were organized under 4 domains. The domain of “experiential genetic nursing knowledge” and the domain of “ethics and law” were ranked as the first and the second in significance. The quasi-experimental study showed that the mean scores in K-PGTN were significantly increased from 8.19±2.67 to 11.25±2.51 (P<0.001). The mean scores of “ethics and law” in I-PGTN decreased significantly (P=0.023). The headings of 4 categories and 2 domains were revised. Conclusion: This study identified competencies for prenatal genetic nursing and nursing education in Korea. There is a need for nursing instructors and researchers to improve the competencies of nurses in the identified areas. Particular emphasis should be placed on experiential nursing knowledge and on ethics and law related to prenatal genetic nursing. © 2020 Korea Health Personnel Licensing Examination Institute.

AB  - In the French education system, the current curriculum for students from the primary to the end of secondary school is structured around the notion of key competence. A competence can be defined as an integrated and stable network of knowledge and know-how, with normative behaviors, procedures and types of reasoning. However, without a theoretical conceptualization of building and mobilization processes, the components of a competence are considered as isolated and not interconnected. In the health and physical education (HPE) setting, too few empirical studies have analyzed how teachers would contribute to the development of student’s competence. The aim of this forward-looking article grounded on an experiential and cultural framework consists in clarifying and illustrating a conceptualization of the dynamics of development of competences among students considering the teacher activity. This theoretical framework seems to offer heuristic possibilities for the examination of teaching and learning practices which contribute to the development of the key competences, particularly when a competence is read as an experience that integrates multiple dimensions. Based on audio-video recording of PE lessons and self-confrontation interviews with the teacher and a student, the results of the present study strengthen the criticism of the definition of competence emphasizing the relevance to adopt a holistic approach corresponding to the articulation of intertwined resources (i.e. motor, methodological and social) students allocate to act in PE groups. Furthermore, the results show that the competence building depends on various roles students have the opportunity to play in PE (i.e. observer, tutor). Finally, our results underline the importance of identifying the specific characteristics of the teacher activity designed to structure the learning environment to train students to acquire new competences transferable in society. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Building&Learning Project is action-research focused on the environmental consequences of technology. The didactic design is structured on the classic program proposed for the scholar discipline Technology for the first grade of secondary school; it tries to answer to the requirements of the National Plan for a Digital School (PNSD). Our first aim is to overcome the diktat “teach how to use the media” and reach the capacity to “teach with the media”, to avoid the danger of a “technocentric illusion” and to get the purpose to develop the competences proposed by Europe and Italy. Our teacher-researcher prepared every lesson to help the students to: a) get the disciplinary aim; b) understand the process and the consequences that every technology brings with itself; c) apply the theory in a practice activity. Every lesson is divided in two phases: the theoretical part is based on the method of Cooperative Learning, while the second part is a practice activity where students build with LEGO Education Kit a model that forecasts the application of the theory. After the first period, we introduced also a Story-telling part because the students showed great difficulty in expressing the theory explained. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The article outlines the main prerequisites for the transformation of modern competences in the training process of preschool education specialists (experience of the United Kingdom, Germany, Ukraine). Differences in the training of future preschool education specialists are found in the structure and content of educational programs (curriculums), namely: the bachelor’s training of preschool teachers is applied in Germany, as well as master’s programs for training of preschool education specialists; the development of new forms and methods of teaching occupies an important place in advancing of professional teacher education in the UK; they make it possible to create the future teachers’ ability for independent and critical thinking, the practical application of acquired knowledge and experience in educational research, role-based and simulation modeling, and creative search. In terms of professional competences, the most advanced training system of preschool teachers is revealed in the UK. However, in Germany, the process of training specialists in preschool education area was determined by institutional decisions, where preschool education was a form of childcare and part of social security. The United Kingdom is characterized by a longstanding tradition of a detailed, comprehensive framework of teacher’s competences for training of preschool teachers. Therefore, one of the core competences is professionalism and standards in combination with such competences, as: values, knowledge and skills. As opposed to Germany and the United Kingdom, in Ukraine the formation of key competences in the process of training specialists in preschool education is primarily based on professional basic knowledge and skills, values and attitudes, motives of pedagogical activity. © 2020, Sciedu Press.

AB  - The Earth is facing pressing societal grand challenges that require urgent managerial action. Responsible management learning (RML) has emerged as a discipline to prepare managers to act as responsible leaders that can effectively address such pressing challenges. This article aims to extend current knowledge on RML in the domain of corporate sustainability (CS) through the application of threshold concepts, novel ideas which provide a doorway to new knowledge and transform a learner’s mindset. Specifically, after conducting a systematic review of the management literature, we identify 33 CS threshold concepts that are useful for mainstream managers and practitioners in their RML process. We group them into six CS threshold concept themes that can help managers understand the complexities and interconnectedness that characterize CS. Finally, we map CS threshold concepts with key competences for effective RML. Therefore, our contribution relies on translating existing CS theoretical frameworks into transformative, specific, understandable and applicable pieces of knowledge that might help mainstream managers to embed CS principles in their daily management practices. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Purpose: The ideas of integrity, unity, systematic organization of teacher’s work allow presenting the work of the teacher – a complex pedagogical reality – in the form of the unity of three interrelated spaces: the teacher’s personality, pedagogical activity, and pedagogical communication. Methodology: The analysis of the works of national and foreign experts devoted to the study of competences and competencies shows convincingly that, first of all, this phenomenon is associated with professional activity. A natural continuation of the study of competence problems in the late twentieth – early XXI century is the scientific and practical interest in the possibility of forming and developing competence in a specially organized environment. Result: For the authors of the article it is important not only how the teacher develops his pedagogical competence in the process of professional activity, but also how it increases the effectiveness of the educational activity of the student. Discussion. In our opinion, the basic competencies of a teacher of a professional educational institution should reflect the culture of the teacher and are divided into professional-pedagogical, social-motivational, information, communicative, creative. Special competencies integrate the knowledge of the teaching subject and methods of teaching, are divided into objective, content, design, reflexive, monitoring. Applications: This research can be used for the universities, teachers, and students. Novelty/Originality: In this research, the model of the development of teacher's pedagogical competence in the conditions of professional educational organization is presented in a comprehensive and complete manner. © Sergeeva et al.

AB  - Traditionally, the innovation process has been of a closed nature because research or development projects are generated inside the company and brought to the market by a company. However, Chesbrough (2003) formulated the open innovation paradigm, assuming that companies can and should use external and internal ideas as well as external and internal market paths in search of new opportunities for their development. Openness to innovation requires cooperation with other market players, therefore some kind of partnership is necessary to co-create value with various stakeholders. The partners share their knowledge and experience as well as the benefits of jointly conducted innovative projects. Managing this type of partnership is now considered one of the key competences of the organization. However, the issue of managing the innovation ecosystem as the most mature form of open innovation has been relatively poorly researched. We do not know much about what organizational and legal solutions are adopted by companies in partnerships for the development of innovation, what a model of cooperation could look like or how to manage such a partnership. How far should we formalize these processes? While searching for answers to these questions, the author decided to conduct empirical research in 2019 among the consortium members of Group Azoty Pulawy (nitrogen fertilizers production), based on an in-depth, partially structured interview, supported by an analysis of several selected innovation ecosystems of global chemical groups (BASF, MONSANTO, SOLVAY and YARA). Group Azoty Pulawy is part of Group Azoty, the second largest producer of mineral fertilizers in Europe. In 2019, Group Azoty Pulawy generated revenues of EUR 845.4 million and profit of EUR 70.7 million. The results for the first nine months of 2020 were EUR 533.7 million and EUR 37.2 million, respectively (Group Azoty Pulawy interim reports 2020; 2021). The subject of the research was a consortium established in 2011 by Group Azoty Pulawy in order to implement joint innovation projects. In the period between 2011 and 2016, consortium members submitted 22 initiatives, 6 of which were completed by 2016. After five years of operation, the consortium consisted of 12 members, including 5 representatives of scientific institutions, 3 producers of agricultural products and 4 organizations representing agricultural entrepreneurs. The purpose of the research was to assess the degree of openness of project participants to cooperation during the construction phase and the management phase of the consortium. The research of innovation consortium of the Group Azoty Pulawy shows the following: During the construction phase, the members of the consortium were open to the accession of new partners, however selectively, i.e. according to the leader s instructions. The selection of partners was complementary and concerned entities serving the same market segment as leaders. During the management phase of the consortium, the solution that gave the leader the greatest power had the largest number of followers. Most of the respondents were in favour of a formalized cooperation strategy, i.e.The one based on standardizing relations between partners. The respondents were open to both formal (specific, contractual) and informal (relational) mechanisms in building and managing a partnership. © 2020 Institute of Society Transformation.

AB  - The main purpose of this article is to use the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method to empirically study the key competency and capabilities affecting the selection of middle managers for global shipping logistics service providers (GSLSPs). To facilitate this theme for obtaining key competency and capabilities, a list of five management competency with twenty-five capabilities are preliminary summarized. Subsequently, the proposed fuzzy AHP method is applied to measure relative weights for evaluating these competency and capabilities. The appraisal approach is then to perform empirical survey via AHP expert questionnaires. Finally, the empirical results show that: (1) ‘professional competency’ is the most important management competency affecting the selection of middle managers for GSLSPs. (2) In order of relative importance, the top six key management capabilities affecting the selection of middle managers for GSLSPs are the ‘capability to manage work pressure,’ ‘capability to manage crisis,’ ‘capability to lead team awareness,’ ‘capability to manage interpersonal networks perfectly,’ ‘capability to use logistics expertise to enhance work efficiency,’ and ‘capability to effectively build team spirit and work atmosphere,’ respectively. Furthermore, concluding remarks are provided in this article. © Faculty of Maritime Studies Rijeka, 2019.

AB  - The paper reveals a problem of the technological progress and information technologies are changing the modern reality too rapidly, offering all the new tasks, the solution of which was required yesterday. The aim of the work is the substantiation of the need for the communication composition of ontology of educational reality. The attention is concentrated on the education system does not have time to realize and correctly analyze the new experience, which is called to separate the wheat from the chaff, to give students certain guidelines and skills that will allow them not to sink in the stream of new knowledge. The authors stressed that the transformation includes components of modernization, post-modernization, traditional retreat. Àñcording to the authors, the changes taking place in the modern world, the modern socio-cultural situation, require a modern man's mobility and an adequate response to modern requirements of society, put it before the need to revise traditional goals and landmarks. In the work, the authors show that in the pedagogical sense, this means that the main result of education should not be a system of knowledge, skills and skills by itself, but a set of modern key competences in the intellectual, social, legal, communicative, informational spheres. The authors proceed from the fact that the paradigm of intersubjective understanding and communication comes to replace the old paradigm today. The focus of today's research has shifted from cognitive-instrumental to communicative rationality. The authors note that the feature of modern social knowledge, which sets the new paradigm, is that it is carried out through an analysis of what representations indirectly the most cognitive attitude to social phenomena, accompanied by a profound rethinking of the communicative nature of social reality, changes in the social and communicative sphere. © 2020 Transilvanian Association for the Literarure and Culture of Romanian People (ASTRA).

AB  - This is a mixed method study aimed at assessing the extent to which writing assessment literacy (AL) of Iranian English language teachers reflects its socio-cultural construct. The five key aspects of quality assessment for writing based on Lee’s 37 study and Coombs’s 14 socio-cultural conception of AL are used as a framework to analyze both student and teacher data, acknowledging the importance of including students’ perspectives. Quantitative data, collected through a questionnaire answered by 105 English language students, were combined and compared with qualitative data from three EFL teachers. Data were analyzed in relation to the key competencies for writing assessment. On the whole, limited writing assessment skills of EFL teachers were suggested from the perspectives of both groups of stakeholders (i.e., students and teachers). More specifically, results revealed that students’ report of the teachers’ writing AL did not reflect the five key principles. A general need to enhance the socio-cultural aspect of writing AL among Iranian EFL teachers was highlighted as well. © 2019, National Taiwan Normal University.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the learning outcomes of the project-based learning in a Master Class programme on sustainability carried out in collaboration by the University of Helsinki and a private company operating in global mining technology. The following two questions were addressed: Q1. What kind of sustainability competences do participants acquire in the Master Class? Q2. What is the role of PBL in the learning outcomes? Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on an ex ante open-ended survey and post-ante interviews addressed to the participants. The data were analysed using the qualitative content analysis. Findings: The findings show that the Master Class contributed to most of the competences under study. However, unlike in previous studies, systemic thinking is highlighted as a fundamental rather than a parallel core competence. Furthermore, the results also emphasise the role of emotions, which is insufficiently acknowledged and accounted for in sustainability education. Research limitations/implications: The study focussed only on the learning outcomes of the participants (students) and not the other parties (such as company and researchers). Practical implications: Future research should focus on affective dimension as a stepping stone to the transformational learning. In addition, the role of the systemic understanding in sustainability education should be highlighted as a core competence. Social implications: The study revealed the overall positive impacts of the co-creation in university – business collaboration to the participants’ sustainability competences. Originality/value: The study presents an empirical case study where the various competence frameworks were applied with a result of confirming the validity of the existing key competences, in particular the systemic understanding and showing the role of the affective dimension in the transactional learning. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Teachers' professional development is a continual and dynamic process, in which key competency cultivation is the core. This essay probes into key competencies that EFL teachers in western rural areas should be entitled with, including language knowledge techniques, English course knowledge, teaching cognition ability, teaching planning ability, teaching performance ability, teaching evaluation ability, teaching research ability and humanity literacy. The focus of this essay is the construction of EFL teacher's key competency cultivation system based on the theoretical construction of teacher's competency cultivation at home and abroad, on the background of new curriculum standard background, guided by socio-cognitive teacher's view. Based on this, an integrated cultivation mode cooperated by the government, universities and high schools is put forward, which is a curriculum system infused with pre- and after-service, securing the cultivation process interacted by practice and inner-reflections. © 2020 World Journal of English Language.

AB  - Is it possible that by playing video games adults can develop key competences that may prove beneficial in dealing with the new challenges of 21st-century society? The present study identifies the profile of adult video gamers and defines the characteristics of the games they choose to play. It also examines the way and with what type of video games adults perceive that key competences are developed. From a quantitative perspective, the questionnaire on video games and adult education (QVAD) (Alonso and Yuste, 2015) was applied to a sample of 404 subjects. The results confirmed that adult video gamer, while playing, also learns and develops key competences. Role-playing games are those most closely linked to the development of hard (technical, practical and mechanical) and soft skills (personality traits) for globalised society. In order to favour video games of interest to adults, they should be allowed to choose different levels of difficulty and promote individual decision-making, commitment and responsibility. Information and motivation regarding video games should be reoriented, especially in the case of women with secondary and higher education and older people, who choose cognitive and strategy video games out of concern for their cognitive development, when role-playing would really respond better to their needs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between the candidate’s lifelong learning key competences and educational technology standards self-efficacy. Relational scanning model was used in the study. The sample of the study consists of 594 teacher candidates enrolled in the pedagogical formation course of the Faculty of Education of Fırat University. In order to collect data, the “Lifelong Learning Key Competences Scale” developed by Şahin, Akbaşlı and Yanpar-Yelken (2010) and “Competences Scale for Educational Technology Standards” developed by Çoklar (2008) were used. Diagnostic analysis, t-test, MWU and Pearson Correlation analysis were benefited from for data analysis. According to the analyzes, it was determined that teacher candidates participated in lifelong learning key competencies in upper intermediate level in dimensions other than “communication in foreign language competence” sub-dimension. Significant results were found in favor of female candidates in terms of the “competence of communication in the mother tongue”, “competency to learn learning”, “competency of social citizenship awareness” and according to the gender variable across the scale. It is determined that teacher candidates have high level of educational technology standards self-efficacy. A significant difference in favor of female candidates was observed according to the gender variable “technological processes and concepts knowledge”, and according to gender” learning environments and planning and designing of learning experiences” sub-dimensions. It was figured out that teacher candidates had moderate level positive relationships between the key competences of lifelong learning and the educational technology standards self-efficacy sub-dimensions. In the light of the results of the research, it has been recommended some suggestions. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - As librarians are developing library instruction curricula for map and geography libraries, there are many places where one can find guidance. Instructional frameworks can help organize and teach key competencies and develop literacy of geospatial information for learners. The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education has become the quintessential guiding document for information literacy instruction in academic libraries. One does not teach the framework directly, rather the instructor (librarian) identifies threshold concepts, knowledge practices, and dispositions guided by six core concepts and disciplinary context. Librarians in special collections must consider how to apply such frameworks to specific disciplines, collections, institutions, and curricula. This paper focuses on geospatial information literacy instruction, best represented by librarians offering instruction services on geospatial data and/or technologies to classes ranging from GIScience courses to humanities classes incorporating digital scholarship. The unique blend of geographic literacy incorporating geography, primary-source, map, and spatial literacies as well as data and digital literacies, including data information literacy and the emerging Cyber GIScience literacy make GIScience a discipline where map and geography librarians are well positioned to impact the success of learners and advance pedagogy development. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Youth work in Estonia is focused on supporting young people’s personal development. In the context of Estonian success of PISA test results the discussion on the lack of the so called ’soft/ transferable skills’ has risen. The necessity of these skills in Europe is stressed in the European Union (EU) framework of 8 key competences (European Commission, 2007). Are soft skills learned and practiced within youth work? The main aim of the research introduced in this article is to describe learning objectives and outcomes of non-formal learning practiced in youth work in connection to key competences but also to understand how the process of non-formal learning is planned and carried out, more specifically in hobby and camping activities. We were also interested in how the role of youth worker is described and perceived among Estonian youth workers today, concerning the challenges to ensure multifaceted development of young people. The research of youth workers´ perceptions about their roles is based on individual interviews with nine youth workers from various districts of Estonia. In order to explore the learning objectives and outcomes of non-formal learning practiced in youth work as hobby and camping activities in connection to key competences, the answers from 86 youth centres were collected. The results of the research showed that the main objectives and learning outcomes of non-formal learning activities were connected to key competences contributing to the development of so-called soft skills. The role of youth worker is mostly perceived as young people´s character builder and a role-model to young generation. © 2019 RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR ALL.

AB  - Knowing students' belief of their capability in using the computer tasks is a key competency, necessary for learning in technology-enhanced environment. To generate a valid and reliable instrument for measuring computer self-efficacy (CSE), this study aimed to explore the underlying factors of CSE, and to find out the relationship with students’ academic achievement. The respondents’ CSE was assessed in terms of two dimensions, namely, general and advanced computer self-efficacy. The results revealed a statistically significant difference between Arts and Science students in terms of their CSE in favor of Science students, and also proved that there was no statistically significant correlation between students' academic achievement and their computer self-efficacy. The results provide the foundation for the instrument that allows researchers to determine students’ general and advanced computer self-efficacy, and information that can be useful in enhancing students' academic achievement. © 2019, International Journal of Research in Education and Science.

AB  - In recent years, Computational Thinking (CT) has been claimed to be a powerful way for competencies and skill development for students at any stage. Programming has been the main tool for CT development; nevertheless, several issues associated with learning and teaching programming exist and have been widely described. In this study, we designed and tested in a qualitative way a set of active pedagogical strategies to implement an alternative way to immerse university students in the learning process of CT development. Such strategies were designed and analyzed under the socio-cultural vision of learning, in which individuals interact in communities to build significant knowledge. Results showed that our curriculum design engaged students in the active use of five key skills related to CT, which could be used as the base ground for further programming learning and high-level CT skills development. Additionally, data indicates that students were involved in reflective processes of learning, as well as in the development of key competencies such as teamwork, communication skills and creativity. Theoretical characteristics of the socio-cultural vision of education are subsequentially used to explain and discussed the scope and limitations of the implementation described herein. © 2019 Author(s).

AB  - Collaborative problem-solving skills are one of the key competencies required in the twenty-first century. In this study, researchers attempted to compare the effectiveness of web-based collaborative problem-solving systems (wCPSS) and classroom-based collaborative hands-on learning activities (cCHLA) in the development of collaborative problem-solving skills in junior high school students who were learning science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-related subjects. A quasi-experimental, nonequivalent pretest–posttest control group design was employed, and 241 junior high school students were invited to participate in the study. According to the results, a wCPSS-supported environment with teacher guidance was found to be more effective than either a wCPSS-supported environment without teacher guidance or a cCHLA-facilitated environment in developing students’ collaborative problem-solving skills in STEM fields. The study suggested that a web-based collaborative problem-solving system with teacher guidance can be used in developing junior high students’ collaborative problem-solving skills in STEM education. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The usefulness of ICT in language learning is unquestionable nowadays. There are many digital educational resources available for foreign and second language teachers, materials which are progressively acquiring an important role in the teaching-learning process. In order to respond to the increasing presence of such technologies in the classroom, teachers need to acquire digital and media competences, two key elements for lifelong training process. However, these are superficially addressed in teacher education. In this light, both intraining and in-service educators demand more skills and specific training to be able to teach students how to use technologies and, ultimately, help them develop their own digital and media competences. Following an exhaustive bibliographical revision of scientific literature in the field, this theoretical paper seeks to revise the concepts of digital and media competences as well as to reflect on how superficially they are addressed at universities and teacher-training centres. After this, the importance of both competences as key elements for teachers is brought to light, as well as some useful suggestions to help foreign and second language teachers acquire and develop them and, simultaneously, teach them to their students. © 2020.

AB  - Over the past 50 years, colleges and universities have taken on increasingly important roles as anchor institutions in U.S. cities, partnering with local communities to promote development and well-being. Such community-campus partnerships rely on the work of community engagement professionals (CEPs), staff tasked with administering, coordinating, supporting, and leading engagement efforts at institutions of higher education. The preliminary competency model for community engagement professionals (Dostilio et al., 2016) lays out the knowledge, skills, dispositions, and commitments needed to perform this work. However, place-based approaches to engagement have been underrepresented in the emerging literature. The authors contribute to this conversation with a case study of partnership management work at University Neighborhood Partners at the University of Utah. Through this case, we highlight key competencies for engaging in place-based community development, suggest additional competency areas for the model, and explore how an understanding of CEP competencies is enriched and complicated by staff positionality. © 2018 by the University of Georgia.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to determine the level of teacher candidates' lifelong learning competence and basic motivation resources and to examine the lifelong learning competence and basic motivation of teacher candidates in terms of some variables (gender and to be a university student or not). For this purpose, a quantitative study was designed. The research was conducted with 382 teacher candidates being educated in the pedagogical formation program at Trakya University. In this research, "Key Competences for Lifelong Learning Scale" and "Basic Motivation Resources Scale" were used as tools for measurement. As a result of the analyses, it was determined that the basic motivation resources of teacher candidates in all of the dimensions of the scale and lifelong learning competence of teacher candidates except from "communicative competence at a foreign language/s" sub-dimension of the scale are above average. In terms of gender variables, significant difference was found in the "communicative competence at a foreign language/s" sub-dimension of "Key Competences for Lifelong Learning Scale" in favor of male teacher candidates and, on the other hand, significant differences were found in the "the competence of learning to learn" and "the competence of cultural awareness and expression" sub-dimension of "Key Competences for Lifelong Learning Scale" in favor of female teacher candidates. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Translating into a language that is not one's native language is no easy task, but one which may be necessary in certain settings. If a market niche exists for professional translators whose working language is not their native language, as studies have shown it does in Spain, it seems appropriate that translation trainees should be encouraged to develop their competence in what is generally known in Translation Studies as inverse (A-B/C) translation, in order to satisfy market requirements. Given current European Higher Education Area (EHEA) requirements for training students for the professional workplace, most translation degree programs in universities in Spain include subjects in which students are required to translate into the foreign language. This paper describes an early attempt to reconcile institutional requirements (curriculum design, assessment, reporting) and professional requirements (development of translation and instrumental competences, together with so-called soft skills) in the specialised inverse translation class in the Faculty of Translation and Interpreting of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. A competence-based, learner-centred, process-oriented curriculum was instituted. © 2018 Presses de l'Universite de Montreal. All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital competence is one of the eight key competences for life-long learning developed by the European Commission, and is a requisite for personal fulfilment and development, active citizenship, social inclusion, and employment in a knowledge society. To accompany young learners in the development of competence, and to guarantee optimal implementation of information and communication technologies (ICTs), it is necessary that teachers are, in turn, literate. We had 43 secondary school teachers in initial training to assess their own level of competence in 21 sub-competences in five areas identified by the DIGCOMP project, using the rubrics provided in the Common Digital Competence Framework for Teachers (Spanish Ministry of Education). Overall, pre-service teachers’ conceptions about their level of digital competence was low (Initial). Students scored highest in information, which refers mostly to the operations they performed while being students. Secondly, in safety and communication, excluding protection of digital data and preservation of digital identity. Lowest values were achieved in content creation and problem solving, the dimensions most closely related with the inclusion of ICTs to transform teaching-learning processes. The knowledge or skills they exhibit are largely self-taught and, so, we perceive an urgent need to purposefully incorporate relational and didactic aspects of ICT integration. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This article reports on an educational design research study exploring the potential of combining entrepreneurship and mathematics–two of the key competencies stressed as important in a society of lifelong learning. The aim of the study was to explore what happens when entrepreneurship is integrated into mathematics lessons. Eight Swedish primary schools were involved in the iterative design wherein researchers and teachers together planned, implemented, and evaluated lessons. The results indicate that combining entrepreneurial and mathematical competencies may produce a win-win situation. Entrepreneurial competencies can be of value when students are learning mathematics, and at the same time mathematics teaching can be organised so that students develop both mathematical and entrepreneurial competencies. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Since its insertion in 1998, Kigali Institute of Education, currently known as College of Education under the University of Rwanda, henceforth ‘The University of Rwanda-College of Education (UR-CE)’, it`s first mission has been training and producing teachers for secondary schools in Rwanda. To a certain extent, bearing in mind that Rwanda Education Board (REB), an institution in charge of education in Rwanda from kindergarten to secondary education, in designing its programmes, UR-CE curricula from Rwanda Education Board (REB) were taken into account. Recently, REB has introduced a new Competence-Based Curriculum (CBC) replacing the knowledge-based one that has been in practice for many years. Hence, the UR-CE is also obliged to revise its programmes and align them with the new CBC designed for secondary schools so that the UR-CE graduates are equipped with required knowledge and practical skills to cope with the demands of the newly introduced secondary school competence-based curriculum. Relying on existing documentation supported with our observations and critical analysis, this analytical paper attempts to highlight some of the knowledge, skills and attitudes deemed important to be incorporated in new UR-CE revised programmes in a way to align them with the secondary school Competence-based curriculum designed by REB. It also seeks to point out some of the challenges that might be associated with the teaching of such suggested knowledge, skills and attitudes; and provide measures to mitigate such challenges. © 2018 Conscientia Beam.

AB  - cpm.4.CSE/IRT (compact process model for Competence Science Education based on IRT models) is a process model for competence measurement based on IRT models. It allows the efficient development of measuring instruments for computer science education. Cpm.4.CSE/IRT consists of four sub processes: B1 determine items, B2 test items, B3 analyze items according to Rasch model, and B4 interpret items by criteria. Cpm.4.CSE/IRT is modeled in IDEF0, a process modeling language that is standardized and widely used. It is implemented in R, an open-source software optimized for statistical calculations and graphics that allows users to interact using the web application framework Shiny. Through coordinated processes, cpm.4.CSE/IRT ensures the quality and comparability of test instruments in competence measurement. Cpm.4.CSE/IRT is demonstrated using an example from the competence area of Modeling. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Established in 1949, the People's Republic of China has gone through 70 years of history. From China's initial inception to the modern day it has grown quickly and become a major force on the world stage, the basic education in mainland China has contributed to cultivating student's talents and developing qualified workers. Specifically, in the 1980s, after implementing a national policy of economic reform and opening up mainland China, China has started a continuous reform in basic education aiming to shift the examination-oriented educational system to literacyoriented education so as to help students to become modern productive citizens in the twenty-first century. Moving into the twenty-first Century China expanded its education infrastructure and instituted compulsory education from grades 1 through 9, the law was intended to create a compulsory 9-year education. This first round of educational reform began in 1986 helping to ensure every child went to school. The second round began in 2001 when the Ministry of Education promulgated new curriculums, which put forward several new philosophies related to the implementation of literacy-oriented education for the first time in mainland China. The third round began in 2012 when the 18th National People's Congress put forward the fundamental goal of the education named Lideshuren, which means the basic education must make efforts for students' development in moral and core competencies, pushing reforms related to human-centered and quality-oriented education to develop students to be more capable in the twenty-first century. Teachers are the key to improving education quality. Each basic education reform in mainland China has triggered a paradigm shift in teacher education. In particular, the first-round reform started in the 1980s has caused mainland China to attend to the professionalization of teachers. Three reforms in science teacher professional development have occurred in the past 30 years. The professional identity of science teachers changed from that of the lecturer in the science classroom to that of the facilitator of science beliefs and is morphing into that of a practice-based-researcher in science teaching. This paper outlines the characteristics and effects of the threestage Chinese science teachers' professional development. It also points out the difficulties and challenges science teachers currently meet in professional development. Hence, the paper provides a case for creating a team of professional science teachers in developing countries. This effort will provide an exemplar to help improve students' scientific literacy all over the world.  © The Author(s).

AB  - This article presents a documentary analysis focused on the external tests assessing the scientific and technological competence in the sixth year of Primary Education from three different points of view. Firstly, we pay attention to its adjustment and adaptation to the variables of the reference theoretical frameworks; secondly, we characterize the presence of scientific and technological competence in the tests and, thirdly, we determine the relationships between the variables and the evaluated competence. 169 activities have been analyzed through triangulation among experts. The results show that the adjustment to the theoretical framework is weak and that the applied competence requires scarce interpretation of data and research design. Finally, there is a symmetrical and positive relationship between cognitive demands and competence level. © 2019 Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona. All rights reserved.

AB  - The UN Transforming ourWorld: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (herein, Agenda 30) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer both a set of aspirations for the kind of future we would like to see for the world and a suite of targets and indicators to support goal implementation. Goal 4 promotes quality education and Target 4.7 specifically addresses Education for Sustainability. However, creating a monitoring and evaluation framework for Target 4.7 has been challenging. The aim of this research was to develop a meaningful assessment process. We used a dialogical intervention across complementary expertises and piloted concepts in a trainer workshop. We then developed a modified competency framework, drawing on previous competency models but innovating through the addition of intrapersonal competencies, a self-reflective validation scheme, a focus on non-formal learning, and specific alignment with SDG 4.7 requirements. Through exploration of how such learning could be activated, we proposed the use of multiple intelligences. Education plays a synergistic role in achieving the aspirations embedded within Agenda 2030 and the SDGs. We concluded that Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) will require individuals to acquire 'key competencies', aligning with notions of transformational learning, in addition to other generic and context specific competencies. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The article analyzes the key competence of “learning to learn” from the cognitive and metacognitive perspective. “Learning to learn” is one of the competences identified by the European Commission as a key to successfully addressing the challenges of the 21st century. In this paper, we argue that the cognitive and metacognitive aspects of learning are most important to gain an understanding of this key competence and enable individuals to pursue an independent and successful learning at school and beyond. Research into these processes began in the early 1980s, especially in the fields of cognitive and educational psychology, and a lot of correlation was found between cognitive learning strategies and learning achievements. It is argued in the article, that learning to learn is a competence that needs to be developed through formal schooling and beyond. It affects changes in teaching approaches and organization of students’ learning as a whole. © 2019, Vilnius Pedagogical University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: To describe our experiences with the development of an elective course on the pharmacist’s role in disaster management for third-year pharmacy students and to evaluate its effects on students’ knowledge and their perceptions of the introduction of this course into the curriculum. Methods: An expert team of physicians, surgeons, and pharmacists of the Service de Santé des Armées, pharmacists teaching at the Faculty of Pharmacy, and pharmacists from the Bataillon des Marins Pompiers de Marseille developed a program consisting of 30 hours of modules on disaster response training based on previously published recommendations, a literature analysis, and international guidelines. Students’ knowledge of key competencies was assessed after some teaching sessions through a multiple-choice quiz. Students’ self-perceived knowledge, perceptions of teaching quality, and degree of satisfaction were evaluated through a voluntary survey after the last teaching session on November 15. Results: The final curriculum consisted of 6 modules. Students’ knowledge of key competencies was assessed using multiple-choice quizzes, with a mean score of 19 of 25. Almost all students (98.3%) reported that this training program improved their knowledge of the pharmacist’s role in disaster management, and 79.3% stated that they would recommend this optional course. Conclusion: This training course demonstrated the potential to increase the number of pharmacists prepared to respond to disasters. It also expanded students’ understanding of the pharmacist’s role and stimulated their interest in emergency preparedness. Further refinement of the program, including a simulation of mass triage in an emergency setting, will be conducted next year. © 2019, Korea Health Personnel Licensing Examination Institute.

AB  - Purpose: The paper aims to present a pedagogical model tailored to the development of key competences in the urban planning profession in post-socialist transitional countries that is based on the creation of an integrated platform for dialogue and the development of professional competences as part of the process, whereby students produce their final projects. Design/methodology/approach: The pedagogical model is based on the principles of education for sustainable development and focuses on the establishment of a repeatable platform for dialogue between students and mentors, members of the mentoring team, the local community, external members of the consulting team of experts and foreign master’s degree programmes, in the process of producing students’ projects. The proposed method addresses several dimensions, including: the education of students, teachers, professionals and local experts, the establishment of a network for cooperation and collaboration and the delivery of practical and usable results. Findings: The paper provides a comparative overview of the pedagogical model’s application in producing the final master’s degree projects of three generations of students, as well as its alignment with the needs of re-defining the role and reach of the profession of urban planner in an environment of post-socialist transition. The model was improved, enhanced and optimised through this process and then corroborated with its practical implementation. Originality/value: The innovative pedagogical model comprises an instrument to enhance the professional capacities of all participants in the production of final master’s projects: academics, practitioners and future professionals/students, through discussions of topical issues, innovative modes of work and new professional responses grounded in the local context and tested by a broad range of stakeholders. It is of particular importance for countries in transition experiencing a shift in the paradigm of professional action, especially as the proposed pedagogical model establishes a problem-solving platform that surpasses academia. © 2018, Marija Maruna, Danijela Milovanovic Rodic and Ratka Colic.

AB  - Learner-centered pedagogy (LCP) is one of the best approaches in developing knowledge, skills, and attitudes of learners to cope with the changing world. Implementation of LCP practices tend to vary from one context to another. It is within this perspective that this study was conducted with the aim of investigating the teachers’ attitudes toward LCP in public primary schools located in Nyarugenge District. A sample size of 165 teachers was selected from 13 public and government-aided primary schools. Simple percentages, and chi-square analysis were used to analyze data, and the findings were triangulated with questionnaire and interview responses. Results show that primary school teachers manifested negative attitude toward LCP. The study also indicates that both institutional and individual factors, such as insufficient and inadequate trainings, lack of clear indicators on LCP, and lack of prior experience on LCP among colleges and university tutors during preservice training, affect the attitude of teachers. It is further revealed that gender does not influence the attitude of teachers; however, training was found to be significant at.05 level. It is therefore important that authorities ensure proper training to head teacher, school subject leaders, and teachers on LCP and avail clear indicators on those methods. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - In the present article, the authors propose the conceptual basis for the design of corporate educational environment of professional development and performance review technology. Within the framework of this concept, the educational process is based on the principles of "learning through game" and visual simulation. The environment provides variability and continuity of educational programs in accordance with the job features of trainees. Profile competence card, which includes three profiles: professional knowledge profile; professional abilities' and skills' profile; and personal qualities' profile, is prescribed to each position in the organization. In order to determine the individual indicators for each profile and create job profile, the authors conducted a sociological survey of middle-ranking managers and staff members of the organization. Based on the results of the conducted survey, the authors offer visuagraphic profiles of the manager's position consisting of the professional skills' profile and personal qualities' profile. © 2018 Academic Research Publishing Group.

AB  - This study aims to explore school administrators’ insights into the key competencies that play an important role in achieving success in English language teaching and learning at government primary schools in Thailand. The study employed semi-structured interviews with six school administrators, including four principals and two head teachers of foreign language departments from Bangkok and five regions in Thailand. Based on SEAMEO INNOTECH’s (2015) Success Competencies of Southeast Asian School Heads, the results reveal that school administrators’ essential competencies include strategic thinking and innovation, managerial leadership, instructional leadership, personal excellence, and stakeholder engagement. These competencies are overlapped, interconnected, and underpinned by complex factors including school administrators’ visions and administrative policies, English as a medium of instruction, Thai teachers, foreign teachers, teacher professional development, students’ learning behaviors, learning materials and ICT, English language development activities, family engagement, and the strong support of the Ministry of Education. These factors are not mutually exclusive; they are, rather, interwoven in the sophisticated educational networks that require consistent and mutual collaborations from all relevant stakeholders who will gear the students towards English language learning success. School administrators’ competencies and leadership skills should be enhanced for effective administration. Professional learning community partnerships need to be initiated and strengthened for long-term collaborations in order to enhance sustainable development of English language teaching and learning in primary education in Thailand. © 2018, The International Academic Forum (IAFOR).

AB  - Being able to communicate in foreign languages, along with the remaining key competences for lifelong learning, are of special significance for upper-secondary school students–soon-to-be tertiary education students and employees. Although Polish educational authorities have made efforts to account for this need in the Core Curriculum for Modern Languages, the provisions are pursued with difficulty in school practice. The aim of this paper is to address this challenge by exploring and evaluating the feasibility and student-participant perceptions of urban gaming in school settings as a didactic tool that facilitates language education, as well as digital, social, and learning to learn skills development in an upper-secondary school. Accordingly, the paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a technology assisted urban game named ‘As it once was in Cracow—discovering the history of the city’, developed for a group of Polish upper-secondary school students (N = 25) from Warsaw. The results provide evidence for student-perceived educational gains with regard to the development of skills such as teamwork, digital literacy, the English language, and content (history) knowledge. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Societal developments necessitate the continuing development of higher education, as labor markets are in full swing and professions are shifting in orientation or sometimes disappear completely. Therefore, a concomitant goal of higher education should be to help students develop metacognitive skills and domain-specific knowledge and skills. For many years, competence-based education and problem-based learning have dominated higher education. In this article, an overview of the principles and development of these concepts is given. Subsequently, based on self-regulation theory, approaches to learning and the demands of our society to learn how to face wicked problems, a sustainable approach to teaching and learning are outlined in this conceptual article. The multiple layers from which a sustainable learning environment should be built provide guidance for instructors during the design of their educational practice. Practical implications for educators to approach the transition to sustainable learning environments are given in the form of questions that can shape the dialogue on sustainable education. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The aim of the Croatian language teaching in elementary school is to enable students to develop language communicative competence which would allow them to successfully acquire the curriculum, and to be functionally included in the lifelong learning process (NPiP, 2006). Since the process of language acquisition does not only include acquiring linguistic and communicative elements but also developing psychosocial skills, L1 communication is emphasized as the first and most important out of eight key competences in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Vijeće Europe, 2005). Therefore, all the participants within the educational process are expected to encourage the development of language competences – firstly communicative and then linguistic competence. A child enters the language communication process by means of listening and imitating adult speakers of a language community, after which the processes of repetition and understanding, and the act of speaking are triggered. After finishing preschool, school-age children develop more complex language skills such as reading and writing. However, the basic skills of listening and speaking should still not be neglected. Unfortunately, the teaching experience and scientific research (Aladrović- Slovaček, 2011; Cvikić, Pavličević-Franić, & Aladrović-Slovaček, 2015; Jelaska, 2005; Pavličević-Franić, 2005, 2011) point to the fact that it is precisely the basic language skills of listening and speaking that are not being sufficiently included in the teaching process. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to articulate the immense importance of the receptive skill of listening and the productive skill of speaking within the process of learning and teaching Croatian, since they are the basic linguistic skills necessary both for acquiring the Croatian language and other school subjects. © 2018, FACTEACHEREDUCATION.

AB  - Aim/Purpose This study aimed to explore whether students' self-reported use of various learning strategies affected their perceptions on different course activities as well as their perceived performance in terms of both cognitive learning out-comes and general skills. Background In a highly active learning environment that incorporates research into teaching, the effective use of various learning strategies is considered of high importance for the successful engagement of students. Yet, this line of research has mainly focused on individual learning. Shifting from individual to collaborative learning settings, the current study investigated whether students' use of self-regulated learning, peer learning, and help seeking strategies influenced their perceptions on both the group activities and the respective outcomes. Methodology At the beginning of the course, 81 first semester postgraduate students self-reported the level of use of self-regulated learning, peer learning, and help seek-ing strategies by filling in the respective subscales of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). Then, groups of 3 or 4 students were formed and instructed to create several learning artifacts of different types and conduct a peer-tutoring session, based on a topic assigned to them by the teach-er. Additionally, the same groups conducted a research project of their own choice within course topics. Students' final grade served as an indicator of their academic performance. At the end of the semester, students filled in a ques-tionnaire eliciting their perceptions on the process and the outputs of the course activities. Finally, through statistical analysis of students' responses to the questionnaires, the influence of learning strategies on students' perceptions and their academic performance was examined. Contribution Our findings contribute to the literature regarding the research-teaching nexus in higher education settings. More specifically, the study shows how students' self-reported use of learning strategies affects students' perceptions on the ac-tivities they were engaged in, their achievement of cognitive learning outcomes, and their skills development in a research-integrated course design. Findings Students perceived differently the value of producing and studying learning arti-facts. Students who scored higher in the self-regulated learning and peer learn-ing subscales of MSLQ perceived their role as more active in the preparation of the presentation for the peer-tutoring session, which was the artifact that re-quired higher level of interaction among the group members. Students' final grades were influenced partially by their self-reported use of different learning strategies. Recommendations for Practitioners Integrating research into teaching through the assignment of research-related tasks to students can promote students' acquisition of domain knowledge and research skills. The merits of this approach can be further strengthened by hav-ing students working in groups and providing the outputs of their involvement in the research-related activities as learning material for their peers. Further-more, students' individual characteristics (e.g., use of learning strategies and preferences should be taken into account when designing course activities). Recommendations for Researchers Researchers should continue to explore the way that various learning strategies influence different aspects of the learning process, especially in the achievement of cognitive learning outcomes and the development of general skills. Impact on Society Creating learning environments that foster students' active engagement with the course material and peer collaboration should be a vital goal of higher educa-tion institutes as it can improve students' performance and promote the neces-sary skills for self-directed and autonomous learning, a key competence in the modern workplace. Future Research In this study, both cognitive learning outcomes and general skills were assessed by students' final grade. In a future study, distinguishing these different types of learning outcomes would allow us to examine in more detail the impact of stu-dents' learning strategies and course activities on the accomplishment of cogni-tive learning outcomes and general skills. © 2018 Journal of Information Technology Education: Research.

AB  - This article outlines organizational-level competencies within the changing social housing context in Ontario. The changing context is occurring at the same time as key board members and staff are retiring. This prompts the question of how the sector can ensure excellent housing for low-and middle-income tenants into the future, while keeping in mind its social justice origins. Social constructionist, adult education, and critical theoretical traditions guided the research questions and methodology of this study, resulting in a working definition of organizational competencies. Organizational competencies have been identified through a sequential mixed methods approach. Four key competency clusters have been identified: capital asset, sectoral operational, people-oriented, and strategic. These clusters and the competencies they contain provide a model to assist organizations in meeting their social justice and business goals into the future. © 2018, University of Alberta Library.

AB  - Leaders play a crucial role in the success of any organizations be they private or public entities, new or mature firms, profit or non-profit organizations. Leaders are expected to lead their people in perilous times where volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity are the general norms. The aim of this research is to identify the competencies expected of future leaders, which comprises of senior managers and middle managers and to explore the framework sought to develop the intended competencies in order to achieve the desired organizational performance and goals. This exploratory research identifies the key competencies from the viewpoint of Malaysian organizational leaders. For this research, an interview approach was employed with the research instrument adopted from Frost & Sullivan. A total of eleven chief executive officers and general managers from the private and public sectors in various industries participated in the study. The findings identified twelve key competencies that leaders must possess and the top four are: strategic thinking, communication skills, technical skills and, coaching and mentoring. However, the importance of the competencies is not the same between private and public sectors. Only two competencies; strategic thinking and networking have similar ranking. There is also a paradigm shift in the mind-set of the public sector where the competency of business acumen is ranked fifth among the twelve competencies identified. This finding will allow organizations to strategize their leadership development program. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.

AB  - One of the concerns in our time is the need to integrate economic, social and environmental aspects, which is known as sustainable development. The role of higher education is essential for providing future professionals with the necessary profiles to respond to the sustainability challenges in increasingly complex and global contexts. That is why numerous authors have sought to define key competencies, skills and learning outcomes for sustainability. However, there is still no agreement on what these key competencies for sustainability in higher education really are. For that reason, the objective of this paper is to determine which are the sustainability core competencies, considering three different geographical regions (Europe, Latin America, and Central Asia), and the perspective of four different stakeholders (graduates, employers, students and academics). The framework of the research is the development of the so-called Tuning projects, which aim to design comparable and compatible higher education degrees in different regions of the world, based on student-centered and competency-based learning. Using an exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the results of this study reveal the existence of a factor intimately related to sustainability, which includes competencies such as commitment to the preservation of the environment, social responsibility or respect for diversity and multiculturality, among others. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Based on discussions in a workshop associated with the conference The Agroecological Imagination: A Franco-American Exchange, we synthesize the state of agroecological education. We focus on three central questions: the what, how, and who of agroecological education. What are the key competencies, skills, and attitudes for future agroecologists? How do we best teach and learn agroecology? Who the learners and teachers are and should be? With regard to the what, we offer the notion of the expert-generalist who has an expertise but is also trained in integrative and transdisciplinary thinking. With regard to the how, we emphasize the importance of experiential learning and action learning, or active experience, and process for content in context. With regard to the who, we discuss the centrality of recognizing the broad community of agroecology, and the importance of agroecological education reflecting that breadth. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The European Recommendation on Key Competences for Lifelong Learning (2006) advocates communication in both the mother tongue and the foreign language as an essential learning strategy for citizens in a knowledge-based society. In Spanish education, linguistic competence has been widely developed and researched. However, the Common European Framework of Reference divides communicative competence into linguistic, sociolinguistic and pragmatic subcompetences. Considering this, the aim of the present paper is to provide strategies and resources to develop these three subcompetences in the foreign language and content and language integrated learning (CLIL) classrooms. The results will allow both teachers and learners to know which aspects speakers of foreign languages must master if they want to become communicatively competent. © 2018 Theoria et Historia Scientiarum.All right reserved.

AB  - Generic problem-solving skills have been identified as one of the key competencies valued by professional programmes, university students and their future employers. A lack of widely available and simple testing tools prevents assessment of the development of student problem-solving skills. As part of a research study, a generic problem-solving test was administered to 130 third-year science students during three consecutive years. A comparison between the scores students achieved in this test with their six academic marks obtained in this course showed no significant correlation. Lack of correlation between the problem-solving skill test scores and academic marks of students was confirmed in a larger population of students participating in a campus-wide study of generic problem-solving skills (n = 830). Problem solving and academic performance may represent two independent skill sets of students; testing problem-solving skills of students could be introduced to achieve a more comprehensive evaluation of undergraduate student progress and achievement. . © 2017, © 2017 British Association for International and Comparative Education.

AB  - Background: The Brazilian undergraduate medical course is six years long. As in other countries, a medical residency is not obligatory to practice as a doctor. In this context, this paper aims to clarify what and when competencies in communication and professionalism should be addressed, shedding light on the role of university, residency and post-residency programmes. Methods: Brazilian family physicians with diverse levels of medical training answered a questionnaire designed to seek a consensus on the competencies that should be taught (key competencies) and when students should achieve them during their medical training. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and correlation tests. Results: A total of seventy-four physicians participated; nearly all participants suggested that the students should achieve communication and professionalism competencies during undergraduate study (twenty out of thirty competencies - 66.7%) or during residency (seven out of thirty competencies - 23.33%). When competencies were analysed in domains, the results were that clinical communication skills and professionalism competencies should be achieved during undergraduate medical education, and interpersonal communication and leadership skills should be reached during postgraduate study. Conclusion: The authors propose that attainment of clinical communication skills and professionalism competencies should be required for undergraduate students. The foundation for Leadership and Interpersonal Abilities should be particularly formed at an undergraduate level and, furthermore, mastered by immersion in the future workplace and medical responsibilities in residency. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Research problem – Today the quality of vocational education and training (VET) and especially the quality of the didactic process in VET highly depend on the capabilities of VET teachers to structure knowledge and skills they impart when dealing with the increasing volume of vocational and professional knowledge, and also on their capability to integrate the requirements of occupation and needs of students when coping with the challenges posed by fast technological development and changing student identity. The goal of this study is to explore the role and potential of key competences of VET teachers and how their development could equip VET teachers with the above-men-tioned capabilities. The research methodology is based on both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The quantitative study was carried out by using a standardised questionnaire. Such a study helps disclose the personality traits of VET teachers, ways of their professional development and specific characteristics of their educational process. The participants in this research were VET teachers from different VET schools in Lithuania. Research data were analysed by using mathematical-statistical methods: descriptive statistics, nonparametric hypothesis testing, and factor analysis. Qualitative research was carried out by interviewing VET teachers from different VET schools and centres in Lithuania. Key competences and their development significantly contribute to the development of professional identity and personality factors of VET teachers. There is a direct and positive interdependency between the development of key competences of VET teachers and the quality of didactics, pedagogy and the expertise of VET teachers in the given occupational field. Key competences help VET teachers to shape and develop their professional identity and to cope with the current methodological and organisational challenges in the fields of curriculum design, organisation of training processes (including application of contemporary educational technologies), and vocational didactics. © 2019, Adam Marszalek Publishing House.

AB  - Over recent decades, education policy has been preoccupied with economic growth while paying insufficient heed to global sustainability challenges. International initiatives to promote education for sustainable development (ESD) have been hampered by a lack of clarity on how to implement this form of education. To address this concern, a Rounder Sense of Purpose (RSP) began as a three-year EU-funded project that set out to develop a practical accreditation model for educators working on ESD. Expert and user opinion was sought through several rounds of structured consultation with over 500 people, chiefly using a Delphi approach, to develop and validate the model. The resulting framework comprises 12 competences, each with three learning outcomes and several underpinning components. This is supported by a range of activities largely reflecting a constructivist pedagogy. A range of assessment techniques have also been piloted within the project although this remains an area for further enquiry. Ultimately, it was decided not to design a single qualification template because defining the award to such a level of detail would make it more difficult to apply across multiple jurisdictions. Partners also felt that such an approach would atomize learning in a way that runs counter to the holistic principles of sustainability. RSP provided a rich learning experience for those involved and has already demonstrated its potential to extend its impact well beyond the original participants. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The global dimensions of climate change necessitate a response that takes national differences–social, economic, geographic, and cultural–into account. Action-oriented education has a key role to play in advancing citizen engagement in a culture of sustainability. This paper describes research conducted with one such education programme, Youth Leading Environmental Change (YLEC), which operates in six countries and engages university-aged youth in discussion and practice related to global sustainability, systems thinking, and environmental justice. YLEC aims to advance four key competencies; this paper focuses on the goal of action competence, which involves acquiring knowledge, reflecting on experience in the context of one’s values, envisioning alternative futures, and acting individually and collectively to advance those alternatives. The present article examines the impacts of YLEC on environmental action competence in two of the countries involved in this research: Uganda and Germany. In-depth interviews were conducted with participants in both countries to examine the development of action competence during and after the programme. Findings suggest that outcomes differed in each country, reflective of participants’ different lived experiences. YLEC effectively built on the conditions faced in each country to accompany youth to a higher level of awareness and action. These findings have implications for environmental education programmes striving to work with multiple nations and diverse participants. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to identify the competencies of educational technologists by surveying the professionals within the field. The Educational Technology Competency Survey (ETCS) developed in this research was based on a conceptual framework that emphases the definition of educational technology and associated knowledge, skill, and ability statements (KSAs). Using the conceptual framework, the study was executed in four phases: (1) an extant review of relevant literature related to competencies of educational technology professionals, (2) job announcement analysis of 400 postings from five relevant databases, (3) extraction and merging of the KSA statements from the job announcements and relevant literature, (4) administration of the survey on a wide-variety of educational technology professionals (N = 219). One hundred seventy-six KSA competencies were derived from the process and organized into KSA statements. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and multivariate analysis of variance. The findings demonstrate key competencies such as instructional design, project management, learning theories, working in teams with diverse stakeholders, and twenty-first-century proficiencies. Discussion and recommendations for future research and practice are provided. The ETCS was found to be a valid and reliable measurement system for these data. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Vocational education is emerging as challenge right now due to the low level of relevance between education and quality of graduate workforce. This research aims at describing and analyzing model of plan, implementation, and supervision of entrepreneurship education on agribusiness study programme in Vocational School (SMK). The research approach is qualitative with type of research expost facto, and uses purposive sampling technique with technique of analysis interactive model data. The result of research shows that model of learning plan, implementation, and evaluation still uses semi-modern conventional pedagogy that has not been effective in developing students’ entrepreneurship soft skills ability and there has not been integration among entrepreneurship soft skills proponents (headmaster, entrepreneurship lesson teachers, and other lesson teachers). CBT is emerging as formative theory that can be used in vocational learning and can prepare expected competence that depends on dispositions (values, concerns and manner) that moves into maturity. In accordance, integrated entrepreneurship education development is needed that depends on soft skills and Competence Based Training (CBT) then it can improve graduate quality in creating student entrepreneurship soul on the level of personal maturity, student competence attainment, reduction on workforce needs gap, reduction on unemployment rate, and improvement on numbers of entrepreneurs who become the power of national economy. © 2018, Allied Business Academies.

The study proves the didactic potential of mobile applications which are able to support the quest technology in order to achieve high-priority objectives in the project "Digital School". The authors describe ideas of the methodical approach, which reflect the necessary changes in the support of students' cognitive activity through mobile game applications in the quest genre. The study shows levels of differentiation of education depending on the individual and age characteristics of students and the choice of digital means. The authors prove that the "quest" technology, focused work to solve education tasks, motivates future professional activities, and also with the help of modern digital means, contributes to the development of such necessary cross-professional competencies of future specialists as project activities, systems thinking, interaction and interindustry communication. In conclusion, the authors confirm that the inclusion of mobile game applications in the "quest" genre in education activities will help to form key competencies and skills that meet the priorities of the digital school and are most in demand by society. © 2019 by Academic Publishing House Researcher s.r.o.

AB  - With the tendency of shifting from Knowledge-Based Education into Competence-Based Education, assessment is not only of learning but also for and as learning. In Competence-Based Education, Competence-Based Assessment (CBA) is a process of collecting evidence and making judgments on whether competence has been achieved and regulating teaching and learning activities. Integrating CBA into instruction provides students with opportunities to self-construct their competences by applying academic knowledge to solve assessment tasks well related to real-world contexts. This paper referred to international discussions on the term of CBA, the meaning of integrating CBA into instruction and proposing a process of integrating CBA into instruction Pedagogical subjects for developing core competences of students. This paper also analyzed the development of Problem-Solving Competence and Presentation Competence of 33 Food Technology Education students and 22 Garment Technology Education students after dealing with the assessment tasks integrated into instruction General Psychology and Vocational Education subjects and presenting the results at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Education. Finally, some minor suggestions for developing core competences of Technical and Vocational Education students through integrating CBA into Instruction Pedagogical subjects by carefully considering the consistency of course learning outcomes, teaching-learning activities and assessment were discussed.

AB  - The standards for translating texts in specialized fields have become particularly rigorous with the increasing complexity of material and growing demand for its translation. While translations simply aimed at communication and produced by machine translation are proliferating, the need for reliable and high-quality translations is also increasing. The demand for expert-dependable legal translation is higher than ever, requiring competence-based training in the field of legal translation. This paper describes a guided-task framework for developing subject area competence at the earliest stage of an English–Arabic legal translation course. It presents the three most problematic phases of concept processing in legal translation in terms of: (a) legal systems; (b) branches of law; and (c) genre-based phraseology. The approach presented below is part of a more general study that aims to describe the first course in a series of three graduate courses on legal translation, each of them motivated by a guided-task framework that has the aim of developing three specific competences in legal translation: (a) legal concept processing => subject area competence; (b) documentary research => instrumental competence; and (c) legal rhetorics => communicative and textual competence. In this paper we intend to focus on the first course of legal concept processing as a key prerequisite for legal knowledge development. We illustrate the relevance of addressing specific variables (legal systems, branches of law and genre-based phraseology) when analysing legal concepts in the text that is to be translated, before proceeding to the information search and communication, according to established formulae and conventions. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: Energy poverty can be seen as a relatively new, but typical sustainability problem in which various dimensions (ecology, society and economy) are interlinked and in part conflict with each other. Moreover, the variety of involved stakeholders (planners, tenants, housing companies, private landlords, energy consultants, etc.) represents conflicting aims for solving this problem. This paper aims to present a systematic linkage between higher education for sustainable development (HESD) and education about energy poverty yet. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative comparative case study approach with a similar didactic approach is used. Findings: Based on the literature about HESD and an overall model in general didactics, ten criteria were identified and used for an overall reflection about similar courses dealing with the topic of energy poverty. The criteria covered the learning goals, the didactical approaches and the institutional support in the forms of organisation in the courses. Research limitations/implications: There was no competency measurement of the students in the described courses. Practical implications: There was no evaluation of the development of students’ key competencies for sustainability. However, the reflections of students and teachers revealed a positive development regarding the students’ learning process, especially because they worked on a real-world sustainability problem: energy poverty. Originality/value: This contribution describes how university courses on energy poverty were designed and implemented at five German universities. Against the background of general criteria for HESD, it reflects on the experiences that the use of this concept evoked. Through a comparison of the five courses against these criteria, the paper outlines strengths and weaknesses of the approach and closes with recommendations and requirements for designing further courses. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The contents of Education for Sustainable Development should be included in teachers' initial and advanced training programs. A sustainable consciousness is one of themain foundations for determining the key competences for sustainability. However, there are notmany empirical studies that deal with consciousness from education. In this context, the e-portfolio appears as a tool that promotes reflection and critical thinking, which are key competences for consciousness development. This work intends to propose a categorization system to extract types of consciousness and identify the levels of consciousness of teachers in training. For this research work, which is of an eminently qualitative nature, we have selected 25 e-portfolios of students (teachers in pre-service training) in the last year of the School of Education at the University of Macerata (Italy). The qualitative methodological procedure that was followed enabled deducing three bases that shape the consciousness of teachers in training: thinking, representation of reality, and type of consciousness. We concluded that the attainment of a sustainable consciousness in teachers requires activating and developing higher levels of thinking, as well as a projective and macrostructural representation of reality. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The fact that digital competence is a key competence in the 21st century, which increases the educational level of an individual (in the lifelong learning process) and the chances for their professional growth and personal satisfaction within the context of diverse life realities of the 'networked' society, is currently undebated among experts. However, the qualities to be included as a result of reflecting the current trends of ubiquitous and all-embracing digitalisation and its associated changes in (not only) the educational needs of an individual are more widely discussed in a professional context and within a number of relevant European guidelines. The objective of this study is to contribute to the discussion in the context of the questionable reductionist concept of digital competence, preferring its technological and instrumental dimension, while ignoring enhancement of other key qualities, such as critical thinking, socio-affective qualities and persistent positive value habits of personality interacting with digital media. Especially with this intention, it tests the key tool to improve citizens' digital competence - DIGCOMP 2.0 - The Digital Competence Framework for Citizens. At the same time, it penetrates the process of media education, especially the five fundamental values, which include the new values of the media literacy movement (proposed by J. M. Pérez Tornero a T. Varis) as an integral part of the reflection and description of changes in its paradigm. The study outlines conditions for understanding the digital competence model, which, in the context of the generally perceived educational process should be holistic. Its support in implementation is particularly within formal education. © 2019, Communication Today.

AB  - Those of us who serve the discipline of parks, recreation, tourism and related professions have long struggled with visibility and viability on university campuses. This struggle is magnified by the absence of an adequate umbrella term and the variability in the names of our academic programs and the colleges in which we reside. For some, the general labels of “parks, recreation, and tourism” that have long served as the basis of the discipline no longer adequately represent the specialty areas that are encompassed within our programs. The recent embrace of the experience economy concept, coupled with shifting industry trends, provides a unique opportunity for our academic discipline to position ourselves as change agents. As students emerge as professionals into positions like director of experience design, employee events specialist, participant development manager, employee event and experience specialist, and thought leadership-events and experiences, our duty as educators is to ensure their preparation as industry innovators with firm foundations in the history, philosophy, and key competencies of the field. This case study of Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo examines the strategic planning process ultimately leading to a department name change from Recreation, Parks, & Tourism Administration to Experience Industry Management and explores the implications of that shift. © 2019 National Recreation and Park Association.

AB  - Contemporary society of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) increasingly requires the education system (i.e., the school) to train competent, creative and proactive professionals who will be able to solve real life problems. If society is to achieve this, some key paradigm changes must occur in education. The school must first prepare a competence-based curriculum and, secondly, school practice should move away from subject-based teaching, towards an interdisciplinary STEM teaching approach. Obviously, to support this, modern learning environments and ICT solutions and tools have to be used. However, since the interdisciplinary STEM approach has already been implemented and integrated, it can be said that a new, integrated science discipline (STEM) has already emerged, together with a transdisciplinary approach to STEM learning and teaching. In the present research, a concrete case of designing, developing and producing a solar chimney was used to demonstrate an integrated approach to learning and teaching, while emphasizing especially the advantages of such an interdisciplinary (trans-disciplinary) approach to teaching Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematic content. The empirical research shows that such an approach produces incomparably better results, especially on higher cognitive levels, in comparison to traditional approaches to learning and teaching. © 2019, Scientia Socialis Ltd.

AB  - Background: The personal assistant is a support figure aimed at improving the autonomy and independence of persons with intellectual disability, and is coherent with the new models of intervention with such groups. Method: Two sub-studies were conducted. The first one, comprising 120 persons with intellectual disability and 147 relatives, was aimed at identifying perceptions on support needs for independent living. The second was a case study with 4 participants who received support from personal assistants. Results: In the first sub-study, persons with intellectual disability showed a clear preference for a greater degree of autonomy and self-determination in their life projects. The second one highlights the effect of personal assistance on the individuals' empowerment and the improvement of their autonomy. Discussion: The results are used to suggest a competency profile of the personal assistant, including ten key competencies, and a critical analysis of the most relevant findings is made. © Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca.

AB  - Systems thinking is regarded as a key competence in the field of education for sustainable development (ESD), because it helps students to understand the complexity and dynamics of natural, social and economic systems. In our research group, we developed a competence model that distinguishes four dimensions of systems thinking in ESD. Based on this model, we designed different university courses in biology and geography teacher education and measured their effects on student teachers’ systems thinking and the pedagogical content knowledge for teaching systems thinking with two different tests. Both variables could be effectively promoted depending on the course. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Engineering education is critical for sustainability, given the key role that engineers have in shaping the development of our society. Yet, engineering studies have traditionally not been driven by sustainability-related knowledge and skills, but focused more on general computational skills and technical problem-solving. This has also been the case in our case study, which focuses on recent water and environmental engineering graduates in Finland. We studied the role that sustainable development has had in their education and early career through an extensive questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The analysis was done in two ways: indirectly by comparing how well the key working life knowledge and skills recognized by the respondents correspond with sustainability-related skills, and directly by studying the graduates' views towards the sustainable development and their possibilities to advance it in their work. The results show that although sustainability was not at the core of respondents' studies, their key competencies correspond well with sustainability-related working life skills. The respondents also see that sustainable development has a central role in water and environmental engineering, although it is typically more visible at a strategic rather than a practical level. However, the results also indicate that several early-career engineers have deficient knowledge of sustainable development, and are therefore lacking the ability to fully connect the principles of sustainable development into their own expertise. Overall, the findings suggest that water and environmental engineers with their wide set of competencies have the potential to take on a larger role in building a more sustainable society. To ensure this, engineering education should emphasize the connection between the field and sustainable development and clearly link engineers' core competencies with the skills required to promote sustainability. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - In Uganda CBE was introduced in 2006 and since then no study has been done to find out its suitability in the preparation of competent nurses and midwives. In recent years, there is increased attention given to Competence Based Education (CBE) in nursing and midwifery training programs as means of improving quality healthcare services. The use of suitable pedagogical practices in CBE training is critical for assisting students to effectively learn important concepts needed for their practice. The purpose of this study was to explore the suitability of pedagogical practices utilized in the CBE training programs in Uganda. The study was conducted from March to June 2015, at Mulago National Referral Hospital (MNRH). Concurrent mixed methods were used to gather both quantitative and qualitative data from respondents. A total of 193 participants were drawn from nurses and midwives trained under the CBE program and other key stakeholders, namely school principals, nursing and midwifery tutors, hospital administrators/medical consultants, officials at both Uganda Nursing and Midwifery Examination Board (UNMEB) and Uganda Nurses and Midwives Council (UNMC). Results by the majority of nurses and midwives who benefitted from the CBE training, revealed that the pedagogical practices used were suitable to enable them become competent nurses and midwives. However, the opinion of some key stakeholders differed. They noted that the implementation of suitable pedagogical practices in CBE training faced numerous challenges that needed to be addressed. These challenges included inadequate resources in terms of medical supplies and equipment as well as insufficient support given to trainees during clinical training due to shortage of staffing. This resulted into big workloads due to large student numbers, coupled with insufficient follow up by their tutors who are poorly motivated and have negative attitudes towards students. The study recommended the necessity to sensitize all implementers and stakeholders on the best pedagogical practices for CBE programs. There is also need to improve resources and conditions of students’ practicum training sites as well as to recruit more clinical instructors to specifically support the increasing numbers of students during their practicum training sites. © 2018 The authors and IJLTER.ORG.

AB  - Integrity in medicine is essential. One of the most important competencies a medical student can master is to be honest at all times. Indeed, professionalism is a key competency in the identity formation and development of a medical student. At times, this competency becomes challenged during the resident matching process. The behavior of some students, faculty members, and program directors who participate in the residency program selection process (the Match) often falls short of this ideal when it comes to handling the process that will be most dispositive in directing the future careers of graduating medical students. Violations of both National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) rules and ethical norms have been reported in the literature and experienced by students. In this Invited Commentary, the authors recommend a series of reforms. Substantially more robust enforcement of NRMP rules should be considered, including the creation of an avenue for anonymous reporting by applicants who experience inappropriate pre-Match, postinterview communications. © Copyright 2018 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.

AB  - The purposes of this paper were twofold: (a) to analyse primary school teachers’ perceptions of the inclusion of the key competences in the curriculum; and (b) to test a hypothetical prediction model about the inclusion of the key competences in the curriculum according to their perceptions. The participants were 1,010 teachers from 110 schools. The results showed that the teachers need training on this new competency-based approach to teaching, learning and evaluation. The hypothetical prediction model confirmed the high predictiveness of pre-service teacher education and continuous professional development regarding the proper development of the main elements of competency-based learning which contribute to achieving the purposes of today’s education. One of the possible recommendations that could facilitate the inclusion of the key competences in the curriculum according to their perception is teacher training geared towards pedagogical models adapted to the reality of teaching today which optimize teachers’ professional performance and students’ academic achievement. © 2019 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje

AB  - Awareness of social tolerance and intercultural bridge-building can be raised by communication training that focuses on active listening competences. In humanistic psychology, ‘Active Listening’ is understood as a technical term developed by C. R. Rogers (1942, 1951, 1961, 2004) that describes a specific form of attentiveness helpful in different types of professional conversations. This attitude and technique promote highly attentive listeners who are advised to mirror back what has been understood without adding their own viewpoints. When fully realised and appropriately applied, this attitude is much more effective than might be expected. Reasons are reflected on the basis of ‘the dialectic of social recognition’ by A. Honneth (1990, 1992). ‘Active Listening’ opens a royal road to real interest in the counterpart and a deeper understanding of the self and the other, in addition to trust building and fresh insights for both parties during a communicative event. As a course of action, it is successfully applied by therapists, counsellors, leadership personnel, in social and pastoral work, etc. In this paper, the author introduces the cornerstones of the theory behind this communication method and explains how to conduct an exercise of ‘Active Listening’ for students in university seminars. It concludes with a proposal on how to position this approach in the discourse of intercultural communication education, underpinned by the studies in applied linguistics of A. Holliday (2013, 2016, 2018), and taking into consideration the effects of ‘Active Listening’. It becomes evident that in professional and intercultural communication ‘Active Listening’ can be valuable and describes how it can be conveyed. © 2019, Aeternitas Publishing House.

AB  - Equipping students with the capability to perform considerate decision-making is a key competence to elaborate socio-scientific issues. Particularly in the socio-scientific context of sustainable development, decision-making is required for the processing of information and the implementation of sustainable action. Extracurricular activities in education for sustainable development (ESD) offer a suitable format to promote decision-making due to their multidisciplinary and more informal structure. The purpose of this literature review is therefore to analyze empirical studies that explore students' (1) decision-making in (2) ESD-related (3) extracurricular activities. Following the preferred-reporting of items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic search yielded 19 out of 365 articles, each of them addressing all three components. Despite the theoretical relationship, hardly any empirical enquiry is found examining the trinomial interrelation with an equal consideration of all components. Contrarily, we argue that each is positioned in favor for only one component with the others serving as a backdrop. It follows that the full potential of an equal distribution between all three foci has not been explored yet; even though integrating sustainability-related issues in extracurricular activities displays a promising learning opportunity to optimally foster students' decision-making. Instead, studies that concentrate primarily on decision-making as a quantitatively measurable competence were predominant. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - With Kenya having rolled out the Competence-Based Curriculum effective as from 2019, anchoring in it preschool education as an integral component, there is still a level of indistinctness as to the role of the preschool teacher in the core domains of curriculum development and reform. The perspective brings to light insights of preschool teacher engagement and interlinkage in effecting the much-desired curriculum development and reform through learner growth, creating an enabling environment, the need for preschool teacher involvement in curriculum evaluations, reforms and adaptability to transformation. The perspective examination integrates documentary analysis as well as discourse analysis. Evidently, progressive implementation of the Competence-Based Curriculum in preschool education alongside any desired adaptations in a timely, expertise and pragmatic manner driven by classroom realities is considered core in ensuring seamless successive transition of learners. It is not only the basis for foundational skills of literacy and numeracy, but also life skills grounding for learners. The findings examination posits for well-anchored and dynamic policy transition considerations at the governmental level on preschool teacher capacity development. As informed by the core domains of curriculum development, it is recommended that reform thought processes and ideologies ignited by preschool teachers from the grass-root levels should encourage a bottom-top channel of curriculum adjustment recommendations rather than a top-down, unilateral and bureaucratic system.

AB  - The concept of key competencies is an important element of education for sustainability. The cornerstone of key competencies is complex systems thinking. Most who argue for the integration of key competencies into various learning processes also suggest that such integration requires critical reflection on traditional paradigms in various disciplines. This article examines the ramifications of such integration as it pertains to economics. It is argued that key competencies can be learned by studying and applying Peter Söderbaum’s institutional ecological economics because it is based on complex systems thinking. It is also argued that traditional neoclassical environmental economics is not suited for the task because it is based on simple systems thinking. The article concludes with some thoughts regarding how case studies can be used to teach key competencies. Copyright © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - This paper describes an audit workplace simulation and investigates its effects on students’ perceptions of competences, required as important in the auditing industry. Within the competence-based teaching framework, this training activity involves cooperative learning as it combines first-undergraduate and senior students within one team. First, we explore how some key competences are initially appreciated by first-year students. Second, our research empirically assesses how the simulation modifies students’ awareness of those competences. Results of the pretest reveal that senior students’ awareness on key competences is higher than of first-undergraduate students. In particular, communication skills are initially not considered as relevant by the first-year students. Results of the posttest reveal that our intervention significantly improves first-undergraduates’ awareness of technical accounting knowledge and communication skills. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In recent years, Spain’s adult population has been characterised by high unemployment rates, particularly among peopled aged over 18 who do not have the Compulsory Secondary Education certificate. Their training in key competences, such as reading comprehension, would provide them with fundamental learning, empowerment, and better employment opportunities. This empirical study examines the relationship between the use of metacognitive skills while reading and improved reading comprehension – previously shown in other studies – evaluating both constructs and attempting to establish whether there is a relationship between them in a sample of 143 adult secondary education students. Research outcomes in reading competence were lower than expected, with significant differences between stages and average use of metacognitive strategies, influenced by gender and age. A significant, linear, and low to moderate degree relationship was found between two of the metacognitive strategies evaluated and so a predictive model was constructed in which age, level, and use of strategies for problem-solving and reading-support are predictive variables explaining 23.4% of the variance in reading skills. We also suggest some changes regarding teacher practice, prioritising active and self-regulating reading. © 2019 The authors.

AB  - Literacy, in particular functional literacy in various fields and especially in the field of STEM, is becoming an increasing problem in modern-day society. The question arises, can the school system develop the kind of functional literacy in students, which allows them to fulfil, in real life, their personal and professional needs related to the competence of reading and creating written texts from the field of science, technology and engineering? The present research aimed to explore how students in today’s schools are trained in functional literacy, especially in the fields of technology and engineering, and what kind of literacies in the field of STEM they are able to (or should be able to) master competently. The present research showed that students achieve relatively poor results in the area of functional literacy, both regarding their science literacy, and especially their technology and engineering literacy, which is a result of a lack of competence on behalf of mother-tongue teachers to develop this kind of functional literacy. Functional literacy should be developed by teachers of individual areas of STEM subjects. © 2019, Scientia Socialis Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The paper aims to examine the current status and development of sustainable development in Finnish engineering education. Design/methodology/approach: The study consists of interviews with key stakeholders supplemented with the analysis of documented material. Development is discussed in relation to the findings of collaborative strategy process in the year 2009. Findings: The paper observes that the Finnish universities providing engineering education are committed to sustainable development in their strategies. However, a lot of work remains to be done before the strategies are implemented and sustainable development is integrated to all degree programs. Explicit knowledge and individual learning in clearly defined disciplinary boundaries have been the main focus of engineering education. Practical implications: The paper suggests that engineers need to be provided with mental tools to cope with uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. Key competencies include holistic understanding, communication and collaboration skills, ability and willingness for critical and reflective thinking, creativity, innovativeness and entrepreneurship. Thus, collaborative learning, open dialogue and innovation are at the heart of education for sustainable development. Originality/value: This paper has a relatively wide approach as it analyses sustainable development in the context of Finnish engineering education both on institutional and societal levels and is based on a national project. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The early promotion of self-regulated learning (SRL) has aroused increased interest since it has been highlighted as the key competence for lifelong learning (E.U. Council, 2002). To meet the demand for early support, an intervention for kindergarten teachers to foster SRL in five to six-year-old children was developed (Venitz & Perels, 2018). In the present study, different SRL promotion strategy profiles of kindergarten teachers were investigated by using latent profile analyses and the effectiveness of the developed intervention was evaluated under consideration of the found profiles. The results of latent profile analysis (n= 134 kindergarten teachers) displayed specific profiles that differ regarding the degree of self-reported knowledge concerning strategies to promote SRL in children. Using a sample of n= 76 kindergarten teachers who participated on a three-week training which was focused on the reflection of the own SRL as well as the promotion of SRL, differential effects of the found profiles were investigated. The results indicate that an adaption of the intervention according to the different SRL promotion strategy profiles would be meaningful, because kindergarten teachers with high and low SRL promotion strategy profiles differed significantly concerning their repertoire of supportive strategies and their SRL behavior. © IEJEE.

AB  - The world of employment is impacted by major trends that are imposed by the on-going industrial advances. The changing labor market and the future of work calls for a paradigm shift in teaching and learning to equip graduates with competencies they need for current and future jobs, and in particular, those of the engineering and technology programs. The purpose of this study is to discuss previous work in the subject matter, to outline a set of teaching and learning strategies, and to create a roadmap for main players to work through to arm graduates with the intended competencies skills. To achieve this objective an extensive literature review was carried out to identify what teaching and learning strategies are currently in-place, and what skills are anticipated. However, still, the education institutions not been able to provide the workplace with competent graduates. A proposed set of intended competencies skills along with teaching and learning strategies for properly preparing future engineering and technology graduates was developed; and a roadmap was built to show the roles of college administration, professors and students to ensure an effective way to support students gaining these skills. It is recommended that these sets of strategies including the facilitation of the roles of the main players to be incorporated in the educational programs learning outcomes. © 2019 Kassel University Press GmbH.

AB  - Education for sustainable development (ESD) is intended to enable individuals to shape a fair and sustainable society. Implemented at schools, ESD addresses specific topics, e.g. globalization or pollutants in clothing. This study investigates what challenges are connected with such issues in class and how students deal with issues of sustainable development at German secondary schools. Several teaching units in different subjects and schools were video- and audiotaped. The empirical material was analysed using the Documentary Method (a qualitative reconstructive approach) to describe students’ competences that emerged within different pedagogical arrangements. We identified three key competences that provide important skills for handling issues in ESD that deal (1) with the state of not knowing, (2) with perspectivity, and (3) with calls to action. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Introduction: Curricular integration in higher education has been widely supported in the educational literature. As a result, several health care and specifically dental curricula have evolved from compartmentalised disciplinary training to integrated modalities; however, in many courses, a pre-clinical-clinical watershed remains a barrier to integration in dental education. This article introduces a general description of the pre-clinical-clinical transition in dentistry according to the outcomes of the discussion held during the first working group session of the “Transition to Clinical Training” Special Interest Group during the 2016 annual meeting of the Association for Dental Education in Europe. Materials and Methods: An online questionnaire was made available before the meeting to survey the curricular characteristics of the participants’ schools. During the meeting, a working session related to the pre-clinical-clinical transition occurred. Conclusions from the discussion are summarised in this article. Results: Fourteen dental schools from 12 countries participated in the online survey. The included programmes had an average duration of 5.3 years (SD = 0.48), with high school or the local equivalent as the required entrance level for dentistry. The hybrid curriculum was the leading curriculum design (n = 9) followed by competence-based curricula (n = 3), with patient treatment as the core of clinical training in every included programme. Conclusion: The pre-clinical-clinical transition in dentistry is a recognisable matter in dental education that requires assessment and research to ease the management of a stage with relevant influence on educational outcomes. This article presents an initial framework for further research and educational intervention. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - This study explores why and how learner-centred pedagogy (LCP) as a policy has been adopted in Rwanda, despite ample evidence of the failure of LCP in developing countries. The case of Rwanda, as a late adopter, shows that at this stage of pedagogy diffusion the influence of global mechanisms and actors has been amplified. This study draws upon interviews with key stakeholders and relevant documents during the 2011–2016 period. The transfer process is examined by analysing the rationale offered and mechanisms deployed by the Rwandan government and aid agencies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article presents results of a study carried out at the Faculty of Education of the University Eduardo Mondlane, in Mozambique, aimed to assess the extent to which the bachelor course in Psychology promotes multiple intelligences as superimposed to holistic learning styles within its effort to develop students' competences. For that purpose, 158 psychology students were invited to fill in a four-point Likert scale questionnaire. Respondents were asked to gauge lecturers' practices of employing different methods and strategies to promote multiple intelligences and holistic learning styles and to indicate what their preferences were concerning methods that could be employed more often. Results show that lecturers promote holistic learning, despite prominence of practices that are more tied to logical and analytical skills, in the left hemisphere, with less emphasis on right hemisphere processes such as ludic activities, drama and simulations, and physical involvement. Such results point to the need for the promotion of professional development efforts towards increased adoption of more holistic learning and multiple intelligences within the bachelor course in Psychology. © University of Deusto.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how educators can teach the key competence of a sense of initiative and entrepreneurship (SIE) as a cross-curricular subject in compulsory education. It draws both on the literature relating to entrepreneurial education and on competence-based education to set out five features of entrepreneurial teaching. For illustrative purposes, these five characteristics are explored in a questionnaire put to a small group of teaching staff. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs a qualitative approach, seeking to understand the personal perspectives of participants, and drawing out the complexities of their behaviour, whilst also providing a holistic interpretation of such behaviour. Findings: The literature review identifies five features of entrepreneurial teaching: embedding learning outcomes for a SIE within taught subjects; active entrepreneurial teaching; educating for entrepreneurial attitudes; networking activities; being entrepreneurial as part of lifelong learning. It can be hypothesised that teaching staff teach different aspects of the SIE depending on the subject they teach (vocational or more traditional) and their role (teacher or workshop assistant). Originality/value: Development of the SIE and the five characteristics of entrepreneurial teaching is a first step towards understanding how secondary vocational teachers and workshop assistants understand and teach the SIE as cross-curricular subject. In line with Fayolle and Gailly who called for deeper investigation of the most effective combinations of objectives, content and teaching methods, the paper seeks to establish a relationship between teaching methods, development of entrepreneurial attitudes and assessment. © 2018, Daniele Morselli.

AB  - The acquisition of competences for sustainable development can be promoted in educational contexts through Visual Thinking. This study is based on the implementation of the Visual Arts in Education (VA.E) project and the development of a programme of socialization and training for teachers of schools in area 6 of the city of Mixco in Guatemala. The participant observation and research action are the core methodological tools to study four key competences, namely critical analysis, systemic analysis, collaborative work or work through projects, and commitment to society. The results were obtained from the analysis of the competences and capacities acquired during the training process, in which students and teachers participated and expressed through observable learning conducts or achievements. The proposal aims to contribute to the study of the impact of Visual Thinking as a tool for teaching-learning of students in rural schools, and of teaching practices based on the acquisition of competences for sustainable development that can be assumed by teachers in all educational levels and contexts. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of this study is to compare the 2013 and 2018 primary and secondary schools ELT curricula in Turkey in order to explore which new contributions the 2018 ELT curriculum brought compared to the previous curriculum, namely, 2013 ELT curriculum. While the two curricula are compared in detail, only the seventh-grade syllabi will be referred to due to word limitations. This study adopts a qualitative approach to educational research and hence utilizes a document analysis to find out which new contributions the 2018 ELT curriculum brought to English education in Turkey by analyzing and comparing important components of 2013 and 2018 curricula, namely, needs analysis, goals and objectives, the syllabus (content), method, materials, assessment and evaluation, weekly class hours, the use of mother tongue in the classroom. No differences were found in terms of the treatment of needs analysis, goals, approach and method, types of materials and the use of the mother tongue. Minor revisions are observed in the organization of syllabus, the selection of topics in the seventh grade, objectives (the place of objectives under different titles), weekly class hours, assessment and evaluation. While many parts of the theoretical background are identical, some additional sections are added to the 2018 ELT curriculum such as “values education in the curriculum”, “key competencies in the curriculum”, “suggested testing techniques for the assessment of language skills” and “suggested contexts and task/ activities”. The “communicative functions and sample uses of language” section of the 2013 ELT curriculum is deleted in the 2018 ELT curriculum. The 2018 ELT curriculum copies many sections of the 2013 ELT curriculum without citations. © 2019. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The Romanian Law of Education of 2011 includes the principles regarding the non-formal way of teaching Sciences. In a modern society, where there is a load of information and knowledge surrounding us, the interest towards Sciences, and especially practical Sciences, has increased. In order to maintain this interest, teachers have to use and apply modern teaching methods and tools. The present research aims to conclude the teachers’ opinion whether non-formal teaching methods, interactivity in the process of learning have had an effect on the teaching of Sciences, the teachers’ viewpoint regarding the introduction of competence-based teaching. We led our research among the teachers working in secondary schools, as well as in non-formal educational centres, with the help of an online questionnaire. (N=102). The results of the research show that the non-formal after school activities, together with the formal ones, help the teaching and learning of Sciences. Most of the teachers asked agree that the non-formal activities help in the development of the key competencies. Our research shows the lacks and drawbacks of the teaching of Sciences, both in formal and non-formal teaching. © 2019 Transilvanian Association for the Literarure and Culture of Romanian People (ASTRA).

AB  - Communicating in one’s mother tongue is one of the key competencies for lifelong learning. Speech culture implies knowledge of the laws governing voice, grammatical and lexical organization of literary language, proper speech, and stylistics. For the teaching profession, this competence is very important. Communication between teachers and students in teaching must be effective. In this paper, we have studied the attitudes of students at the faculties of teaching in Slovenia and Croatia regarding the importance of speech performance and oral expression of teachers in teaching. A questionnaire was used on a sample of 369 respondents. The aims of the research were to compare the attitudes of Slovenian and Croatian respondents towards their own speaking abilities and the importance of this competence in the profession they will perform, improving their knowledge of that ability, ways of developing spoken skills and possibilities for improving their own expression. We also wanted to see if there were any statistically significant differences between Slovenian and Croatian students regarding their attitudes towards spoken language. The results obtained show that both Slovenian and Croatian respondents are aware of the importance of effective oral expression within the teaching profession. Croatian students evaluate their verbal competencies to be at a higher level than their Slovenian counterparts. By contrast, Slovenian respondents evaluate their knowledge of the criteria and strategies for successful speech performance as better than Croatian students. A difference in attitudes is noticed in the domain of preparation for speech performance and in knowing the rules which have to be respected during public appearances. Since all respondents are aware of the importance of quality oral communication in the classroom, lifelong learning is seen as a fundamental aspect of the profession (teacher). © 2019, Slovenska Vzdelavacia Obstaravacia.

AB  - Entrepreneurship education has become an important feature in many programs across higher education-especially in engineering education. A common goal of entrepreneurship education is developing an entrepreneurial mindset in students. Furthermore, a key competency of an entrepreneurial mindset is the ability to empathize with others. Empathy is a cognitive and affective process fostering the capability of understanding and appreciating the feelings, thoughts, and experiences of others. Since entrepreneurship is about introducing innovations into a community, having a keen understanding and appreciation of the needs and desires of community members is an important entrepreneurial skill. This article aims to provide a deeper and broader understanding of empathy and its role in entrepreneurship, along with a brief discussion of educational efforts designed to develop an enhanced sense of empathy in students. © 2016 American Society for Engineering Education.

AB  - This article shares results of a survey of North American academic librarians supporting campus entrepreneurship to identify the job responsibilities and tasks, skills and experience they employ, and the impact of campus context on engagement with this community. A contextual approach draws on a variety of sources to identify competencies which were adapted and then ranked. Research services and outreach; market and industry research; innovation and problem solving are identified as key competencies. While the frameworks that guide business and liaison librarianship provide a starting point, the combination and application of these established skills sets the entrepreneurship librarian apart. © 2018 Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © 2018, © Carey Toane, and Rachel Figueiredo.

AB  - Purpose The oral case presentation (OCP) is an essential part of daily clinical practice in internal medicine (IM) and a key competency in medical education. It is not known how supervisors and trainees perceive OCPs in workplace-based learning and assessment. Method Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, 26 semistructured interviews were held with trainees and supervisors (18 clinical clerks and first-through third-year postgraduate trainees, and 8 supervisors) on the IM clinical teaching unit at the University of Toronto, 2015-2016. Interviews focused on how the OCP was viewed by both trainees and supervisors in clinical practice as a tool for patient care, learning, and assessment. Iterative, constant comparative techniques were used to analyze the interviews and develop a framework to understand trainee and supervisor perspectives. Results Supervisors and trainees viewed the OCP as an important part of informal trainee assessment in IM. Supervisors used OCPs to understand the patient through trainee-demonstrated skills including the use of narratives, information synthesis, and management of uncertainty. However, because of awareness of assessment, trainees sought to control the OCP, viewing it as a performance demonstrating their competence, mediated by senior residents and tailored to supervisor preferences. Conclusions Preoccupied with assessment around OCPs, trainees often lost sight of the valuable learning taking place. Use of OCPs in assessment necessitates optimization of the educational activity for trainees. Providing explicit direction to both trainees and supervisors, defining expectations, and clarifying the assessment activity of the OCP can optimize the encounter for best educational practice. © 2018 by the Association of AmericanMedical Colleges.

AB  - Background: Professionalism is a key competency in first year medical gross anatomy instruction, yet there is a paucity of longitudinal studies addressing professionalism attributes into year 2. This study longitudinally compared 160 preclinical medical students’ peer professionalism evaluations in two small group settings (year 1 anatomy lab and year 2 team-based learning (TBL) sessions) for 2013–2014 and 2014–2015. Methods: Students were evaluated by their small group peers on a scale (0–3) on five professionalism domains (teamwork, honor/integrity, caring/compassion/communication, respect, responsibility/accountability) at mid-term and end of semester in years 1 and 2. Statistical comparisons were made between the formative (mid-gross) and summative (post-gross) anatomy ratings and between the summative anatomy (post-gross) and mid-term TBL (mid-iTBL) ratings. Results: Anatomy professionalism evaluations showed a significant increase from an average ranking of 2.49 at mid-term to 2.6 at the end of the semester, with increases in teamwork, honor/integrity, caring/compassion/communication, and respect. Summative anatomy evaluations (post-gross) were compared to mid-term second year TBL (mid-iTBL), showing significant increases in peer professionalism rankings with improvements in teamwork, honor/integrity, responsibility/accountability, and respect. Conclusions: Significant improvements in peer evaluated professionalism were observed in multiple domains over time in the anatomy lab, with the exception of responsibility and accountability. These gains were maintained into year 2 TBL evaluations, with the exception of caring, compassion, and communication, suggesting that graded peer evaluation may improve professionalism behavior in small group settings. © 2018, International Association of Medical Science Educators.

AB  - The ability of novice instructional designers to become skilled problem-solvers, who select and apply appropriate instructional design (ID) models in their work environments, are key competencies generally sought after in introductory ID courses. Yet, the proliferation of ID models, coupled with varied philosophies and practices about how ID is taught may pose challenges for ID educators seeking to prepare the next generation of leaders in the field. With little empirical research or documented best practices, ID educators are left to their own judgment about to how to navigate the practical challenges that can arise in the pursuit of their teaching goals. This paper shares insights on how ID educators across institutions teach introductory ID under varied conditions, and how ID educators can support each other in addressing challenges faced by those teaching introductory ID and seeking to improve their own practice. Using action research methods, we engaged in cross-institutional collaboration, sharing teaching approaches, philosophies, modes of delivery, instructional strategies, resources, models, and products of instructional design with each other as a means to understand and improve our own teaching practices. We also developed a model for cross-institutional faculty collaboration that is immersive, cyclical, and theory-based, and provides a guide for other ID educators to collectively engage in the work of supporting each other in the common goal of preparing the next generation of instructional design leaders. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Material and methods: Results: Conclusions: ‪Motor skills are very important for socialization, academic achievement, self-concept and adaptation, etc. Physical education should focus on improving this area and increasing the level of motor skills. In the Czech Republic there exists the Framework Curriculum, which sets key competences which pupils should manage. Physical education outputs are not clearly given, so it is not clear which skills and movements should be covered during the first educational period. ‪The aim of the research is to assess gross motor skills in detail in children attending primary schools from 5 regions in the Czech Republic. ‪The research group was created by 224 (124 boys and 100 girls) children with an average age of 8.32 years (first educational period) from 15 primary schools. ‪The research results indicate that the level of gross motor skills is rather alarming (no children scored the Superior or Very Superior level). More than a half of the children scored a lower than average level, while only 41% scored an average or higher level of gross motor skills. ‪It is important to set some standards to curriculum to know what children should manage within physical education at the end of each school year during compulsory school education. © Gdansk University of Physical Education and Sport, Poland.

AB  - Curricula around the world make more and more use of goals trying to capture different kind of processes for the students to master. In Denmark these ambitions have most recently been described in terms of subject specific competencies. However, bringing such ambitions into the actual teaching practices has proved challenging. KOMPIS was a longitudinal project aimed at developing and examining ways of dealing with some of these challenges in lower secondary Danish classrooms in collaboration with teachers. In this paper, we present aspects relevant to mathematics and science curricula. As a key point of this analysis we present a two-dimensional content model derived from KOMPIS that proved useful in supporting competence-based curriculum development and teacher planning. We argue that curriculum descriptions of competency objectives need to be clear and distinct as well as independent of subject matter to be operational. © 2019, Bastas. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sustainability science emerged as a new academic field to address complex sustainability challenges. To train sustainability experts, sustainability science programs and sustainability-focused courses are offered in higher education, especially at the graduate level. Given the diverse topics and the complex structures of sustainability challenges, what are the required knowledge and skills needed for sustainability experts? Although the earlier literature identified key features and competencies, empirical studies on how educational programs in sustainability science provide the necessary training are still scarce. This study addresses this gap by illustrating how a field-based course can contribute in developing core skills for fostering sustainability experts through a case study of field-based course called Global Field Exercise (GFE) in the Graduate Program in Sustainability Science-Global Leadership Initiative (GPSS-GLI) at The University of Tokyo. Literature review on the competencies in sustainability science suggests a three-way typology of descriptive-analytical skills, solution-oriented skills, and attitudinal skills. A group of students joined a GFE unit in Akita, Japan, and set "local food and place attachment" as the topic for their fieldwork. The participants conducted semi-structured interviews to three generational groups to illustrate the different perceptions of local food and places. The alternative mechanism of knowledge transmission across generations by local festivals and school events was found. The authors observed the implemented field-based course provided unique learning opportunities to acquire: (i) the ability to perform key competencies collectively instead of individually; (ii) an interdisciplinary-mindset to acknowledge multiple views to topics during group discussions among researchers; (iii) a transdisciplinary-mindset to communicate research outputs with local residents in a communicable way; (iv) the ability to be empathetic to people's experiences when addressing normative dimensions of sustainability. Although different sets of competencies and approaches for fostering sustainability experts have been studied widely, the field-based approach plays an important role in developing transdisciplinary, interpersonal, and normative competences. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This article unpacks the authors’ roles as a designer, design researcher, and business strategist in translational medical research. Translational medical design is presented as a responsibility of the university to assist researchers to leverage fundamental research to create interventions that have a real impact in the community. The article makes an inherent link between translation and the notion of responsibility, suggesting an overarching directive to move research outcomes from fundamental discovery to interventions that help people in the world. To distinguish the role of design as distinct from other translational disciplines, we recognise and position the end-user at the epicentre of an integrated, co-design process, a process that connects complex networks of researchers and industry practitioners, with clinicians and patients. Through design research, designers act to derive potential interventions from unmet clinical needs in the community. Additionally, through applied practice-based research designers identify opportunities for intervention in the world outside the lab. Yet, there is a gap in how we determine which clinical needs and interventions have the highest likelihood of making it to market. Therefore, this article highlights the challenges in the commercial translation of fundamental research in the context of the Australian University System. A framework is proposed to assist design researchers to assess the commercial potential of medical research projects. The framework improves the direction of limited internal funding to projects with the highest likelihood of producing commercially viable, feasible, and desirable outcomes. The article establishes the translational designer as a key competency positioned between traditional and nontraditional research activities. It recognises the designer’s need to identify projects of broader translational value and to communicate the impact that design methodologies can have on commercial research translation. © Common Ground Research Networks, Kieran James John, Rowan Page, All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This article argues that although Civil Social Organizations aspire towards a culture of participatory process-driven governance and management, the reality seems far from this aspiration. A culture of participatory processes is understood in this study as working and decisional engagement practices which are part of internal decision-making and action-taking processes from Community Development Agents (CDAs). This brings an ethical dilemma, as these organizations claim to operate upon principles of participation, solidarity, democracy, social justice, human dignity and decent work. Through this study, 506 Peruvian CDAs offered their own analyses about the factors that foster and/or inhibit their participation in specific organizational managerial and professional developmental areas, such as: Systemic planning, organization, sustainable management and empowerment. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies was used to gain a comprehensive understanding of the field of study. Dialogical focus groups were applied, by which CDAs themselves identified and deconstructed the inhibiting and facilitating factors. The study echoes CDAs' aspiration to engage meaningfully with decision-making and action-taking processes as well as creating the participatory mechanisms and processes themselves. In order to do this, CDAs demand an ethical and democratic competence-based training, to empower them to democratize their organizational structures and to counterbalance their daily power relations and dynamics. © 2017 Oxford University Press.

AB  - The study examines the impact of the Flipped Classroom (FCM) on the development of key competences for the 21st century (KC21) in future teachers. Experimental design with two parallel groups was used. The sample consisted of 122 students of the Faculty of Education, i.e., experimental group-EG (60), and control group-CG (62). The EG attended lectures implementing the FCM, while the CG received traditional instruction. Results show that there is no significant difference in self-assessment of competence development between the EG and CG related to creativity, responsible attitude towards work, health and environment. There is a significant difference in the self-assessment of competences related to socio-emotional skills, problem solving, critical thinking, information and ICT literacy and learning to learn. The conclusion is that the implementation of the FCM can influence the development of the majority of KC21. © 2019, Adam Marszalek Publishing House. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article provides an overview of six years of research with the goal of identifying key music technology competencies seen as essential for the undergraduate music major by tertiary music professors largely in North America. The results of the research are viewed from multiple dimensions: ‘pillars’ of curriculum as defined by a recent College Music Society (CMS) (United States) task force report, the diffusion of innovative technology historically within music instruction and general categories of music study within the tertiary curriculum. The authors share the results of five separate studies over a six-year period beginning in 2011 dedicated to the identification of core technology competencies for all undergraduate music students. Total responses included 772 returned questionnaires across the five studies that probed key competencies and their role in the instructional process. Consistent support for eleven key competencies was identified. The article concludes by offering a number of creative teaching scenarios across the tertiary curriculum for supporting the eleven competencies identified by participants in the research studies. The results from the research along with the overarching curricular issues presented may apply not only to tertiary music study in North America, but to the broader, international landscape of music curriculum innovation and reform. © 2018 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - This study assesses the challenges facing teachers in the implementation of the paradigm shift towards a competence-based curriculum in public secondary schools in Iringa municipality. The study was guided by three research objectives, namely: to investigate the teachers’ understanding about the paradigm shift towards a competence-based curriculum in secondary schools; to find out the importance of the competence-based curriculum in the students’ academic performance; and to examine the challenges facing teachers in the implementation of a competence-based curriculum in public secondary schools. The study adopted case study design, whereby three public secondary schools were selected. The study involved 39 respondents, namely 24 students, 3 school heads, and 12 teachers. The study employed mainly qualitative research approach. Data was collected through interviews and focus group discussions and was analyzed through content analysis in the light of the research objectives. The findings have revealed that teachers were aware of the paradigm shift towards a competence-based curriculum; however, most of them seem not to implement it due to various factors, including: lack of teaching and learning materials, and poor or low level of language proficiency on the part of some teachers and most students. It was also found out that most teachers were not provided with in-service training as a strategy to improve their teaching-learning situation; as a result, old approaches or traditional-learning-methods were still used by most teachers. The study recommends that regular in-service training for teachers be conducted and adequate teaching and learning materials be provided, so as to enable the implementation of the competence-based curriculum. © 2018, Universita degli Studi di Torino, Facolta di Lingue e Letterature Straniere.

AB  - Healthcare professionals' education is evolving to meet people's needs towards a more comprehensive, collaborative and interdisciplinary training. In medical education in Argentina, in the context of international discussions around competence-based education (CBE), competence frameworks are being developed for undergraduate and postgraduate education, constituting agreed criteria that lead to the design of training programs and work as key tools to ensure educational quality. The Tuning Project and other international frameworks account for this process towards a common definition of standards beyond geographic and disciplinary boundaries. Generic competences (GCs) have acquired increased relevance in CBE discussions, whereas in medical education they involve key skills for patient safety - yet clarity in their implementation still has to be accomplished. In competence-based medical education (CBME), some changes are being hindered by the absence of a common language as well as diverging ideologies and theories. The purpose of this work was to explore conceptions and the terms used when referring to GCs by people in charge of educational planning and design of Human Resources (HR) training policies in Argentina. A qualitative exploratory study was conducted based on semi-structured interviews to key informants from different levels and fields in medical education. Interviews were conducted by one interviewer and analysed by two independent researchers. Results showed that medical educational planners have different conceptions regarding GCs and fail to share a common language to enunciate them. They acknowledge their relevance for patient safety and agree with the notion that, at this time of educational transformation, it would be useful to enunciate them separately from specific competences, although they realise that this involves potential risks in curricular design. From all terms used in this regard, “generic competence” was identified as a contradiction in itself. Consensus on denomination, meaning and visibility in curricula is mandatory. © University of Deusto.

AB  - The member states of the European Union have funded many initiatives supporting the teaching and learning of foreign languages. Content and language integrated learning is one of the experimental language programmes that have been introduced in Catalonia, in the north-east of Spain. The aims of this study are to analyse the results achieved by students on the state test of English language competence during the period 2009–2012 at (1) 1175 Catalan primary schools, (2) a purposive subset of 85 primary schools and (3) a school of reference (SoR), which applies a programme integrating physical education and language. The analysis indicates that the improvement of English competence occurs regardless of whether schools have participated in the experimental English language programmes. It is also showed that slightly better results can be observed in schools that apply the content and language integrated approach and a notable improvement in the SoR. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In order to explore the development of research of science teacher(RST), 904 articles from the Web of Science (WoS) core set based on bibliometric methods through R software were analyzed in this research. Specifically, it examined the co-occurrence relations of countries/regions, major journals, most cited references, and hot keywords from the macroscopic, mesoscopic and microscopic level of RST. The results showed that the core strength of RST is mainly from traditional industrialized countries such as the United States, Australia, and Britain. And some top journals in science education (such as Journal of Research in Science Teaching, Science Education) has to pay more attention on RST, it may also appeal to lots of top journals in general teacher education (such as Journal of Teacher Education, Teaching and Teaher Education). The research on science teachers was guided by several educational theories about teacher research, such as the teacher epistemological belief, reflective practice, and PCK. Moreover, theories in science education such as scientific literacy, scientific conceptual change also becomes the theoretical basis for science teachers’ teaching practice and scientific inquiry instructing. The knowledge, key competences, dispositions, and professional development of science teacher are the main keywords and hot topics in the field of RST. © 2019, Scientia Socialis Ltd.

AB  - Education for sustainable development has been addressed by professionals, authorities, and a number of research studies in the last decades, and yet the results are not clearly visible. Teachers as agents of a new mindset do not seem to understand the ways of approaching raising awareness of the issues of global challenges. This study investigated the possibility of raising the extent of applying critical thinking to the problem-solving issues of a group of student teachers in their initial training. The sample consisted of 48 student teachers. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used: namely, a questionnaire, content analysis, and focus group interviews. An archive of the students' materials was also used for content analysis. In the data analysis, inter-rater reliability, as well as parametric (t-test) and non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U test) were applied. The results of the study provide evidence of the positive impact of the use of case studies in teaching pre-service teachers on the development of their critical thinking skills. It can be concluded that it should not be taken for granted that teachers automatically know how to develop the competencies that are necessary for sustainable development (SD). Instead, teacher education institutions need to incorporate thorough training that focusses on education for sustainable development (ESD) into the entire teacher programme in order to make sure that the teachers leave their initial training well prepared for guaranteeing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This article examines how the concepts of digital literacies and digital competence are conceptualized in curricula for compulsory education within the Nordic countries. In 2006, the European Union defined digital competence as one of eight key competences for lifelong learning. The terms digital literacies and digital competence have since been used interchangeably, particularly in policy documents concerning education and the digitalization of educational systems and teaching. However, whether these concepts carry similar meanings, and are understood in a similar way, across languages and cultures is not self-evident. By taking the curricula in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Norway as examples, this article attempts to clarify similarities and differences in how the concepts are interpreted, as well as what implications this has for the digitalization of education. The analyses reveal that different terms are used in the curricula in the different countries, which are connected to themes or interdisciplinary issues to be incorporated into school subjects. The conceptualizations of the terms share a common emphasis on societal issues and a critical approach, highlighting a particular Nordic interpretation of digital literacies and digital competence. © 2019 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).

AB  - Life-long learning and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in the current fast-evolving and ever-changing society requires modern pedagogical tools and methodologies that help the transmission of key competencies such as coping with uncertainty, adaptability, creativity, dialog, respect, self-confidence, emotional intelligence, responsibility and systemic thinking. The recent trend of the application of Agile methodologies for the management of projects in different fields can be a valuable tool to convey these competencies due to the participative, collaborative and constructionist principles in which they are deeply rooted. Some experiences of the application of Agile Methodologies in education-originating what is known as Agile Education-are, therefore, starting to appear in the literature. This work carries out a systematic review to analyze how this modern pedagogical tool is being used to foster key sustainable development competencies in the field of education. Results are presented for 11 out of 121 analyzed studies which present a direct link between key ESD competencies and Agile Education. It is shown that Agile Education creates a learning environment favorable for the creation of responsible and sustainable citizens while improving the performance, satisfaction and motivation of both faculty and students. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In the past years, the use of educational robots has steadily increased, in particular due to the ongoing digitalization of modern societies and the new skills that professions require. It has been argued that educational robotics activities have the potential to promote the acquisition of such skills and may increase pupils’ interest in STEM disciplines. Despite these results, only few studies have examined the pupils’ perspective regarding the pedagogical value of educational robotics in formal education. Therefore, in this study with 91 pupils aged between 13 and 15 years, we aimed at investigating how pupils perceive educational robotics as a tool to improve their creativity, collaboration, computer science and computational thinking skills and to foster their interest in STEM disciplines. Over a period of one semester, the pupils worked with the robot Thymio II and evaluated their experience through a questionnaire. The results showed that boys and girls have different perceptions on which competences they could enhance: while boys affirmed more often than girls, that they could improve their computer science and computational thinking skills, the opposite was found for collaboration and creativity. Moreover, the results illustrated that educational robotics activities could increase the interest in coding, computer science and engineering, however, this was predominantly observed in boys. © 2019, Italian e-Learning Association.

AB  - There is a consensus that the items proposed by the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) program allow us to focus on the outcomes of the processes of appropriation and transformation of learning tools at the end of compulsory schooling, particularly regarding the key competencies for lifelong learning and citizenship in digital societies. Taking into account these assumptions, this paper focuses on a fine-grained analysis of the dynamics of students’ performance when they are confronted with a question from the mathematics domain in PISA 2012, through the example of the Climbing Mount Fuji item (question 1). In the context of the interaction dynamics (between a student and a research assistant), twelve 15-year-old students from Naples (Campania, Italy) were requested to think aloud when answering the question 1 of the item. Verbatim transcripts of the interactions are analyzed from the point of view of the PISA framework, the mathematical educational framework, and the socio-psychological approach based on didactic contract. The results show that the students involved in this task commit themselves in a complex reasoning, relying on mathematical requirements (e.g., different mathematical procedures) in an attempt to resolve ambiguities in the text, also referring to their everyday school life, activated by the didactic contract implied by the scenario of the question. The interweaving of PISA performances, mathematical procedures, and the socio-psychological approach to test assessment is discussed as a tool for a better understanding of teaching and learning activities. © 2018, Instituto Superior de Psicologia Aplicada, Lisboa, Portugal and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper focuses on the use of evaluation criteria and rubrics as tools for training in an audiovisual translation mode: subtitling for the D/deaf and the hard of hearing (SDH). Following an introduction to the current conception of and research carried out on quality assurance and assessment both in the translation industry and academia, a brief overview of the assessment processes and instruments used in SDH university training and in the professional sector is provided. This is followed by a case study of SDH assessment practices in Spain. Two questionnaires were filled in by five service providers and 12 university trainers, and the data gathered has enabled a better understanding of how assessment is currently being performed. These results, together with the Spanish SDH standards and a competence-based training approach, informed the design of two assessment instruments: a set of evaluation criteria and a rubric, which are both presented here. We also present a series of graduated tasks which are designed to enable students to gain an understanding of and be able to use the instruments to assess SDH. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The article demonstrates the application of the modular competence-based approach for the design of a Master degree programme in translation studies. The case study is based on output materials produced during the lifetime of the Tuning Russia project involving a number of Russian universities, one of which is the Russian State University for the Humanities (RSUH). The module in question - the LSP (language for special purposes) translation module - emphasizes interaction between the related disciplines on the basis of the common subject-matter, i.e. The translation of special purpose texts. The modular approach sets out to achieve key competences required for professional qualifications. In addition, the module considers teaching methods, ECTS and assessment tools. Attention is given to the concept of competence-based approach in contemporary education. The authors argue that the competence-based approach introduced in Russia at the national (Ministerial) level in 2016 facilitates Russia's interactive alignment with the main principles of the Bologna Process adopted by the European Higher Education Area. © 2019 University of Deusto.

AB  - Objectives: This review examines the current evidence on the effectiveness of digital technologies or e-based learning for enhancing the skills and knowledge of nursing students in nursing assessment. Design & Background: This integrative review identifies themes emerging from e-learning and ‘nursing assessment’ literature. Literature reviews have been undertaken in relation to digital learning and nursing education, including clinical skills, clinical case studies and the nurse-educator role. Whilst perceptions of digital learning are well covered, a gap in knowledge persists for understanding the effectiveness of e-learning on nursing assessment skills and knowledge. This is important as comprehensive assessment skills and knowledge are a key competency for newly qualified nurses. Data-sources: The MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health Source electronic databases were searched for the period 2006 to 2016. Hand searching in bibliographies was also undertaken. Review Methods: Selection criteria for this review included: (i) Published in English;(ii) Study design included measurement or analysis of Nursing subject material which included a significant ‘nursing assessment’ component; and(iii) Study cohort was students who were enrolled within schools of higher education or directly working in the clinical practice setting.Findings: Twenty articles met the selection criteria for this review, and five major themes for e-based learning were identified (a) students become self-evaluators; (b) blend and scaffold learning; (c) measurement of clinical reasoning; (d) mobile technology and Facebook are effective; and (e) training and preparation is vital. Conclusions: Although e-based learning programs provide a flexible teaching method, evidence suggests e-based learning alone does not exceed face-to-face patient simulation. This is particularly the case where nursing assessment learning is not scaffolded. This review demonstrates that e-based learning and traditional teaching methods used in conjunction with each other create a superior learning style. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Current European Higher Education Area demands for university degree programmes to focus attention on competence development have brought about the need for effective competence assessment tools. A professional portfolio is one of the tools that may be used by teachers to assess students’ professional competences; besides, it may be used by students to search for a job once they graduate. This article analyses the use of professional portfolios in translator training. Details are given of the contents of the portfolio and the criteria used for assessing the outcome of activities designed to develop professional competence. The results of a survey conducted to find out the students’ and teachers’ opinions on the use of professional portfolios as a new assessment instrument are also shown. The findings show that students have difficulties in defining their professional profile; however, the professional portfolio turns out to have a number of benefits, as it helps students to identify their own general competences and to set future goals, and to become familiar with the market rates and taxation. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Sustainability, sustainable development and education for sustainable development are increasingly central concepts, both in social practice and in the field of scientific knowledge. Sociology, and in particular Sociology of Education as a specialized Sociology, can provide relevant contributions in its promotion. This article aims to explore the importance of Sociology of Education in promoting sustainability literacy in higher education, using the Sustainable Development Goals and key competencies (United Nations and UNESCO) as the central reference in this field, and intends, thus, to become an added contribution for this discussion. The article seeks to demonstrate that the learning of sustainability literacy would benefit from the use of a sociological stance throughout this whole process that considers dimensions that are often not directly emphasized and articulated between each other, such as: interconnection of scale levels, sociological imagination, multi-paradigmatic nature, heuristic interdisciplinarity, reflexivity and use of Sociology for action. © 2019 Academic Research Publishing Group.

AB  - The speed of technological advances, communication, and the current market constantly call into question the role of designers in society. The situation raises new questions about the educational background of design students in the twenty-first century as education is currently changing its focus towards acquiring information by learning how to use it competently. The competence-based training and evaluation model-well-consolidated in the field of education-is becoming increasingly present in the design profession, considered a differentiating factor among professionals. In this context, creativity is gaining strength as a key factor in employability and managing the uncertain future for designers. This article focuses on developing the theoretical framework of creative competencies, a step which must come prior to the development of a Dictionary of Creative Competencies. This dictionary shall be kept up to date through the data collected with an online platform for competence analysis. The article finishes with the contributions that this tool can contribute towards blurring the educational boundary between design education and the profession. © 2019 Common Ground Research Networks.

AB  - This study examined the teaching competencies perceived by special needs education teachers to be essential for inclusive education. Entrenched in inclusive pedagogy, this descriptive study draws on a sample of 24 special needs education primary school teachers purposively drawn from Midlands educational province of Zimbabwe. Throughout the analysis of data, a constant comparative approach of the organization of data with continual adjustment was used. The study found that participants perceived screening and assessment, differentiation of instruction, classroom and behavior management, and collaboration to be key competencies required of teachers for inclusive education. Pre-service and in-service training of teachers in these key competencies could facilitate successful and effective implementation of inclusive education through equipping them to respond to child diversity. This study could serve as a baseline for future research on key competencies of teachers for inclusive education. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education, and the Center for the Advancement of Pharmacy Education frame patient safety from the perspective of medication management, which is also the current focus of pharmacy education and training. With the growing appreciation that diagnostic errors represent an urgent and actionable patient safety concern, the National Academy of Medicine has recommended diagnostic safety training for all health care professions. The Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine has worked with an interprofessional consensus group to identify a set of 12 key competencies necessary to achieve diagnostic quality and safety that focuses on individual, team-based, and system-related competencies. Much of this already exists in pharmacy education, but pharmacy training programs need to give graduates more guidance on how they contribute to the diagnostic process and the prevention and detection of diagnostic errors. We describe the current state of progress in this regard, and what steps are needed by training programs to provide content and assessment so that graduates achieve the requisite competencies. Governing and advisory bodies need to expand the expectations around patient safety to include diagnostic safety.

AB  - Since the mid-nineties, the European Union and UNESCO have promoted a new form of didactics aimed at developing competences. These "key competences", subsequently identified by the Council and the European Parliament, are considered as fundamental for Europe's response to globalisation. Their close link with a neoliberal perspective of the working world - as can also be deduced from the non-random choice of the term "competence" - is evident. In particular, the competence related to the sense of initiative and en-trepreneurship has assumed a strategic role within the "Lifelong Learning Programme" and the "Europe 2020" programme, fostering the spread of a new labour market model no longer based on the prevailing paid employment. Recent Italian legislation on educational institutions, and Law 107/2015 in particular, have acknowledged the European Union guidelines regarding promotion of the key competences, and more specif-ically of alternating school-work pathways. Although it is too early to make an overall evaluation of the effects these laws have produced, the actions promoted so far do not seem to overcome the existing inequality in Italy's educational and employment opportunities. Furthermore, the objective of promoting competences that can be directly used on the labour market, to the detriment of broader cultural preparation deemed useless for this purpose, risks impoverishing the education of the most disadvantaged, those people who have the fewest chances of acquiring knowledge and critical thinking outside the school context. The transformations taking place in the educational field appear to proclaim the advent of a "Competence Society", the last metamorphosis of an epiphenomenon with its roots in the globalised capitalist system which is leaving social reproduction mechanisms unchanged. © 2019 - University of Salento, SIBA.

AB  - Recently China has begun national educational reform that focuses on the development of key competences in all subjects, including English. Based on a survey about secondary school students' key competences in English in Yanbian University in Jilin, this paper explores the gap in the process of translating national educational reform into local practice. The results showed that though cultivating students' general key competences has been legally set as the ultimate goal of basic education in China, the lack of empirical research has made the cultivation low efficient. The results also showed that high school English instruction is still mostly exam and knowledge-centered rather than key competence-centered. The four categories of key competences in English: students' language competence, thinking competence, learning competence and cultural competence haven't been developed in balance due to the influence of the current exam-centered educational system. It is concluded that the transition of the teaching concept, teaching mode and the combination between the concerns of the short term exam-oriented results and the long term lifelong development are the key points to develop students' key competences in English. © 2018 Asian E F L Journal Press.

AB  - The increasing turmoil in the external organizational setting or business environment has focused attention on capabilities and resources as the primary source of competitive advantage. Obviously, this statement points to the application of the resource-based view (RBV) of organizational management. Nevertheless, what constitutes RBV remains an illusion in many quarters of organizational management, as scholars have managed to put up their personal ideas, and managed to converge on phenomenon-driven theories, in addition to RBV. This paper reviews the concepts of RBV in light of knowledge management to highlight some critical pitfalls that might have eluded the research community on the subject matter of RBV. To this end, this papers educational value lies in the fact that it simplifies the concept of RBV to the new researcher in a fashion that is capable of appealing to his or her level. A cross-sectional qualitative research approach was employed in an effort aimed at understanding the role of RBV in creating a sustainable competitive advantage and key competencies. A total of 20 relevant articles were searched from different databases and search engines, including Scopus, EBSCO, ABI Inform, IEEE, PubMed, Science Direct, SABINET, IEEE, Bing, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. The findings indicate that RBV plays an important role and assists organizations not only create, nurture, and maintain competitive advantage, but also understand the collective resources needed to compete favorably in a globalized and highly competitive market. With expert knowledge workers at its core to provide support for knowledge creation, sharing, and utilization, the RBV principles discussed in this paper promise to guarantee a methodological step geared towards the achievement of competitive advantage. It, therefore, makes an incremental contribution to the RBV to attain modest improvement in organizational settings. © The author(s) 2019. This publication is an open access article.

AB  - The aim of this article is to present different procedures (instruments and tasks) for assessing the acquisition of cultural competence in translator training. First, we outline the basis of competence assessment in translator training, advocating a dynamic, multidimensional, criteria-based approach to assessment and explaining the need to use a wide variety of assessment tasks and instruments. Second, we define the concepts of culture and cultural competence and set out different proposals, before breaking cultural competence down into four sub-competences (cultural knowledge, cultural knowledge acquisition abilities, culture-related contrastive abilities, and attitudinal sub-competence) and specifying their respective components, which can be used as indicators for assessment purposes. Lastly, we put forward various procedures for assessing the acquisition of cultural competence. We organise these procedures on the basis of nine instruments, such as translation reports, catalogues of cultural references, translation process recordings and cultural portfolios. For each instrument we describe possible assessment tasks, identify assessable aspects, and state which sub-competences of cultural competence it can be used to assess. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to identify the key competencies managerial coaches have and examine the significant competencies that affect coaching effectiveness in the Malaysian telecommunications industry. Design/methodology/approach: The unit of analysis was individual managerial coaches who were working in the Malaysian telecommunications industry. Among the 300 questionnaires distributed, a total of 140 were obtained and deemed sufficiently complete to be useable. Descriptive and multiple regression analyses were used to analyze the data. Findings: The results indicated that leadership development is the most important function of managerial coaching, followed by communication. In addition, co-creating the relationship and effective communication are the critical categories of competencies for managerial coaching. Analysis from the regression highlighted that effective communication is the influencing factor on the coaching effectiveness, followed by facilitating learning, and results. The findings also shown that all the core competencies in setting foundation are the significant influencing factors. Research limitations/implications: Analyses relied on cross-sectional data and limits the generalizability of findings to other industries. The utilization of self-reported perceptual data may suffer from response bias. Practical implications: This paper highlights personal or professional coaching characteristics that might affect managerial leadership development. It also provides a list of important criteria for developing effective managerial coaching to assist Malaysian managerial coaches to build a world class workforce. Originality/value: Using International Coach Foundation competency model, this study provides an insight on the important criteria to develop and select coaching managers effectively which ultimately lead to performance improvement in the organization. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Communication represents one of the key competencies in a knowledge-based society enabling both empowerment and employment; it is also an effective vehicle for connectivity, cultural innovation and bridging polarities. The triad communication - culture - language should be considered as an essential instrument for overcoming any "cultural shock" in today's multipolar world. Since communication and human interaction are heavily mediated by culture and facilitated by language, hence an unbiased, complex understanding and awareness of other "cultural grids" is a prerequisite for effective interaction and cooperation. Communication does not equal presuming, rather it requires thorough knowledge of language, intellectual empathy and a comprehensive understanding of culture and its main aim is to connect: individuals, communities, geographical or cultural regions of the world. The effectiveness of intercultural communication relies on the power and impact of discourse as well as the ability to empathize with the others. The main goal of the present study is to provide a definition and reassessment of the concept of "international language" mainly grounded on economic and cultural pillars, revolving around the notion of power. The novelty and originality of the present study reside in highlighting the connection between tradition and modernity, between East and West. Chinese language has the potential of becoming international also due to the Romanization of Chinese characters, by means of a worldwide accepted system - Hanyu Pinyin.

AB  - Background Undergraduate training aims to enable medical students to become fully qualified physicians. The aim of the study was to explore the competences that newly graduated doctors (beginners) bring along from medical school into their postgraduate training. In this way areas can be identified that need to be better addressed during either under- or postgraduate training. Methods Competencies were assessed using a paper-based questionnaire that was sent out to 405 physicians in Bavaria being in the possession of a postgraduate training license in internal medicine, surgery and anaesthesiology. The questionnaire included items exploring the fields of competencies outlined in the CanMeds role descriptions. The results were analyzed using descriptive and exploratory methods. Results 190 of 405 questionnaires (47 %) were returned. 96 % of the participants were male, the average age was 54 years. The results indicated that most young medical professionals had the necessary theoretical knowledge to take up postgraduate training. However, putting theory into practice does not work well enough from the physician's point of view. Discussion An approach to further support the transfer of enormous amounts of theoretical knowledge acquired during years of study into medical expertise is needed. In this respect, recently published competence-based curricula for under- and postgraduate training might prove useful. © 2016

AB  - This paper presents the interpretation of consumer innovations as a management object in order to stimulate demand in the market of innovative products. Consumer innovations are treated as a form of realization of knowledge, skills and habits of consumers, which are reflected in the form of useful benefits used to meet personal needs. Consumer innovations are characterized by the presence of positive externalities in the form of exceeding the aggregate benefit over the private, while in the structure of their value a significant share belongs to innovative added value. The role of the consumer in the innovation process increases with the formation of the postindustrial society, which is characterized by changes in the motivation and content of labor activity. This is reflected in the substitution of the materialistic orientations of activity with postmaterialistic in the conditions of the postindustrial society. At the same time, the efficiency of the innovation process and the volume of externalities are determined by the intensity of communications with the participation of the consumer and the manufacturer, which expands the composition of management objects in the market of innovative products. The paper suggests a methodical approach to the content of tools for managing the behavior of the future consumer (innovative product consumer), which is based on taking into account the individual predisposition to perceive innovation, assessing the perceived value of innovative goods by its producer and consumer, as well as the dominant factors in their decision making about choice subject to the economic activity of participants in the innovation cycle. It is determined that the implementation of such an approach provides a reasonable choice of key consumers (innovators), an increase in the proportion and number of consumption pioneers, the early majority, a decrease in the potential buyers' transaction costs for finding information about new products, and shortening of the duration of the innovation cycle.

AB  - The European Framework for Key Competences (2006) promotes a shared European identity as a priority for assuring a cohesive future for the European Union (EU), yet the development of a discrete European identity remains acutely contentious, with critics claiming it is too shallow to support the bonds of solidarity needed to engender and support a shared ‘future together’. Most EU member states now have some sort of citizenship curriculum within their state education systems and most are aware that such programmes are difficult to introduce, to teach and to assess within conventional school curricula. However, much of the citizenship education literature tells us that educators are conscious of the problematic nature of exploring citizenship identities. Drawing on both philosophical perspectives and an empirical investigation undertaken by one of the authors, this paper argues that issues of belonging may prove a useful way to explore wider conceptions of citizenship. The research was designed to examine how visual art and citizenship education could be combined to explore and extend children’s notions of European identity, using data from Images & Identity, an EU-funded 2-year curriculum development project on citizenship and art education in the Czech Republic, England, Ireland, Germany, Malta and Portugal. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Introduction. The low productivity that prevailing in recent years in Higher Education requires urgently institutional responses aimed to improving quality of university education contributing to the development among students of key competences for lifelong learning. In this sense, the aim of this research was to explore the effects of an intervention program, based on service-learning and peer mentoring methodologies, to enhance social skills and the learn to learn skill of university students. Method. The sample was composed of 78 university students of 5 degrees related to the teaching profession of the University of Huelva (Spain). The methodological design adopted was quasi-experimental pretest-posttest, using standardized tests to evaluate the dependent variables. The intervention consisted of 481 mentoring sessions, 423 individual and 58 in group, among the university students, as mentors, previously trained in 3 sessions of training, and students in Compulsory Education. These sessions spread throughout the second and third quarters of the school year 2013/2014 during out of school time, a weekly mentoring session among the couple of mentors with their mentee lasted for 90 minutes each. Results. The results show statistically significant differences in favour of the posttest phase in social skills and strategies for learning and motivation of the participants. Discussion and Conclusion. These results agree largely whit the empirical evidences from specialized literature show when service-learning and peer mentoring methodology are used as the basis for an intervention program. © Education & Psychology.

AB  - Science and engineering educators and employers agree that students should graduate from college with expertise in their major subject area as well as the skills and competencies necessary for productive participation in diverse work environments. These competencies include problem-solving, communication, leadership, and collaboration, among others. Using a pseudo-experimental design, and employing a variety of data from exam scores, course evaluations, and student assessment of learning gains (SALG) surveys of key competencies, we compared the development of both chemistry content knowledge and transferable or generic skills among students enrolled in two types of large classes: a lecture-based format versus an interactive, constructive, cooperative learning (flipped classroom) format. Controlling for instructor, as well as laboratory and recitation content, students enrolled in the cooperative learning format reported higher learning gains than the control group in essential transferable skills and competency areas at the end of the term, and more growth in these areas over the course of the term. As a result of their work in the class, the two groups of students reported the most significant differences in their gains in the following areas: "interacting productively to solve problems with a diverse group of classmates," "behaving as an effective leader," "behaving as an effective teammate," and "comfort level working with complex ideas." Our findings clearly show that cooperative learning course designs allow students to practice and develop the transferable skills valued by employers. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Background: Due to migration processes, cultural diversity and strangeness are becoming characteristics of modern society. The competence to handle this heterogeneity–the so-called intercultural competence–is a key competence for all children and youths. Sports and physical education (PE) are often considered as a particular field for enhancing intercultural competence. However, until now there is no theory-based empirical study that proves this assumption. Purpose: This study was designed to examine the effects of a standardised, theoretically driven programme in PE on the development of underlying cognitive concepts of intercultural competence: acculturation attitudes and attitudes towards cultural diversity. Research design: The research design consists of a quasi-experimental design with four measurement points. The intervention group (N = 69; mean age = 11.6 years (SD = 0.60)) followed standardised and theory-driven intervention lessons following the didactical guidelines of the concept of ‘Intercultural Movement Education’ (IME). The developed games tend to trigger ‘crises’ with the aim to insecure students. These experienced insecurities were afterwards reflected upon with the students. The internal control group (N = 63; mean age = 11.8 years (SD = 0.62)) and external control group (N = 93; mean age = 10.8 years (SD = 0.69)) were taught in a unspecific manner. The impact of the intervention study programme was tested with a reliable and valid questionnaire. Results: A significant time by group interaction effect for the subscale ‘assimilation/segregation’ of acculturation attitudes was found in boys and in girls. The attitudes increased significantly after the intervention. For the girls, the intervention group showed also a significant decrease of the attitude ‘integration’. No significant impact of the intervention study on the attitudes towards cultural diversity could be identified either with boys or girls. Discussion: The effects of the study are ambivalent. The significantly increased assimilative attitudes can be interpreted as a need for a sense of security. This is also underlined by the decrease of the integration attitude that values the maintenance of cultural integrity. It must be critically discussed whether the ‘crises’ were too intense and not adapted to the children’s skills to overcome them. Second, we have to critically analyse whether the discussions with the students about their experiences were sufficiently focused to debrief the students. Summary for practitioners: The competence to handle heterogeneity–the so-called intercultural competence–is a key competence for children and youths. Sports and PE are often considered as a particular field for enhancing intercultural competence. However, until now there has been no theory-based empirical study that proves this assumption. This paper describes the development, implementation and evaluation of an intervention programme on intercultural learning in PE along the didactic guidelines of IME. This programme tries to trigger ‘crises’ that stimulate the students to react and think about their self- and world relations. The statistical analyses show that the ‘crises’ were probably too intense as the students’ scores in assimilation attitudes increased. This lead to the didactical reflection of the implementation of intercultural learning processes in PE. © 2016 Association for Physical Education.

AB  - Purpose: This paper examines the in-service teacher training needs of secondary school agriculture teachers in Uganda as the country moves towards an ‘outcome-based’ education by removal of subjects and instead, uses learning areas, presenting a need for new pedagogical skills among teachers. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Uganda between June and September 2016 to assess the teaching methods and teacher training needs for secondary school agriculture curriculum. Data were collected from 80 agriculture teachers and 57 administrators from 60 secondary schools, randomly drawn from 25 districts in Uganda. The data were analysed with descriptive statistics. Findings: The findings show that there about 10 key competences required by the teachers to thrive in their profession. These range from traditional classroom teaching to community outreach and linkages with agribusinesses which is in tandem with outcome-based education beyond the classroom walls. Respondents highlight lack of practical agriculture skills and exposure to the modern farming practices. Theoretical implications: This paper examines role of formal in-service teacher training based on theory of change and proposes using professional learning communities for school-level improvements. Practical implication: The results were not significant enough to warrant strong recommendations. However, they suffice to highlight a growing need for in-service teacher support mechanism for a dynamic subject like agriculture using communities of practice at school and district levels. Originality/value: In the current context of growing concern for unemployment in Africa, secondary schools will require competent teachers to engage students into transferable learning, given that it is the terminal level of education for majority. © 2017 Wageningen University.

AB  - The emergence of the information society is mediated by the impact of information and communication technologies and demands to schools teaching key competences. This need is clear in the field of information literacies, related to information processing and digital competences. And in this area, it is of vital importance both teacher training and student learning. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of an innovative project for training in information literacy in secondary schools. A pre-experimental design with pre-test and post-test on a sample of 260 students of Castile and Leon and Andalusia spread over 22 teaching groups. The empirical study is based on data collected using a validated instrument for assessing the four dimensions of information literacy skills. After the verification of the previous assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances, an ANOVA with repeated measures and a T-test for two groups is applied in the data analysis. The results support the effectiveness of implemented projects, taking into account the factors autonomous community and tutor in the interpretation of data. In the conclusions, it is considered the importance of evaluation and training in key competences addressing the fundamental issues that arise around and discussing the results, which support the effectiveness of the implemented projects. Finally, after an analysis of the contributions of this work, the weaknesses of the study are highlighted. Weaknesses are focused on the design and development of standardized assessment instruments and the level of experimentally of applied design. These issues point to some future lines of research which are described. © 2017, Ministry Education and Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - The need to strengthen the connection between academia and society has received increased attention over the past years. The importance of bringing university students closer to stakeholders in society as part of their learning process is high regarding sustainable agriculture, because of its applied approach. University programs based on experiential and action-oriented learning have been developed over the past decades, but more knowledge is needed about the impact of these educational activities. In a short course in sustainable agriculture at the University of Gastronomic Sciences in Bra, Italy, we examined the impacts of experiential and action-oriented learning on competency development as well as transformational impacts on the students. We found that students improve on several core competences as a result of their participation in the short course, and also signs of deep transformational processes among the students. © 2016 by the author.

AB  - Background: Ensuring that all medical students achieve adequate clinical skills remains a challenge, yet the correct performance of clinical skills is critical for all fields of medicine. This study analyzes the influence of receiving feedback by teaching associates in the context of achieving and maintaining a level of expertise in complex head and skull examination. Methods: All third year students at a German university who completed the obligatory surgical skills lab training and surgical clerkship participated in this study. The students were randomized into two groups. Control group: lessons by an instructor and peer-based practical skills training. Intervention group: training by teaching associates who are examined as simulation patients and provided direct feedback on student performance. Their competency in short- and long-term competence (directly after intervention and at 4 months after the training) of head and skull examination was measured. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics version 19 (IBM, Armonk, USA). Parametric and non-parametric test methods were applied. As a measurement of correlation, Pearson correlations and correlations via Kendall’s-Tau-b were calculated and Cohen’s d effect size was calculated. Results: A total of 181 students were included (90 intervention, 91 control). Out of those 181 students 81 agreed to be videotaped (32 in the control group and 49 in the TA group) and examined at time point 1. At both time points, the intervention group performed the examination significantly better (time point 1, p = <.001; time point 2 (rater 1 p = .009, rater 2 p = .015), than the control group. The effect size (Cohens d) was up to 1.422. Conclusions: The use of teaching associates for teaching complex practical skills is effective for short- and long-term retention. We anticipate the method could be easily translated to nearly every patient-based clinical skill, particularly with regards to a competence-based education of future doctors. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The article reveals theoretical and methodological foundations of the process of forming logistics competences in a future Manager of a sanatorium complex at the University. A set of theoretical and empirical methods was used in the study to analyze and systematize Russian and foreign experience in logistics training of the Spa managers at the University and normative-legal documents relevant for the subject matter of the study. The authors applied interviewing of respondents, monitoring of educational-professional practices; testing of students; methods of mathematical statistics were employed for quantitative and qualitative analysis of the research results. The logistics training for students majoring in ‘Management of organizations (specialization: hotel, resort and tourist business)’ is one of the important elements of the higher professional education system at Russian universities. For graduates in this specialty (managers of the Spa complexes) logistics is not only an academic discipline but also a professional tool of analysis and management of the processes for the provision of a wide range of Spa services. The necessity to form different types of competences (including professional-logistics ones) of the graduates majoring in ‘Management of organizations’ is associated with the transition of the Russian system of higher education to the competence-based training model. The authors of the article analyze the results of the long-term (2003-2015) experimental work in the field of vocational and applied (practice-oriented) logistics training of future managers of Spa resorts. This research has shown that the formed system of professional and logistics competences of the sanatorium complex managers significantly increases their competitiveness and mobility in the labor market, contributes to the successful labor adaptation of young professionals. © 2016 Nikitina et al.

AB  - The article presents the results of the empirical research relevant to the labor market competencies of graduates with the major in engineering. Subjective preferences of employers shape requirements for the personal and professional characteristics of a graduate. In authors’ opinion, the professional competences of engineers stated in educational standards in sufficient detail and require updating in order of importance for the modern employer. The theoretical search and empirical test are due to determine the set of personal characteristics of graduates, which will affect the successful employment of young professionals and ultimately their competitiveness in the labor market. In the course of the expert survey we identified key competencies of graduates with the major in "Agro-engineering" (Bachelors) and "Operation of transport and technological machines and systems" (Bachelors); ideas of specialists about demanded in current professional work knowledge and skills were studied; grouping of the key functional responsibilities of professionals working in positions of the chief engineer and mechanical engineer was held. Information obtained during the survey of experts can be used to improve the matrix of competencies, content of workshops, updating set of competencies within the University. © 2016 Ivashova et al.

AB  - The competence-based education recently launched in Spanish universities presents a set of abilities and skills that are difficult to teach to students in higher and more technologically-oriented grades. In this paper, a teaching intervention that is based on design methodologies is proposed, to upgrade the competitive capacities of computer engineering students. In particular, this intervention targets those aspects relating to working in multidisciplinary teams and to defining requirements based on the user’s empathy and knowledge. The main idea inspiring this technique is that the underlying challenge is a communication problem. As Brooks (1995) states in his book The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering, even a project having all of the prerequisites for success (a clear mission, manpower, materials, time and adequate technology) could fail as a Tower of Babel. The proposed technique through mixed methods has been evaluated with students enrolled in different courses, confirming the repeatability and validity of this method from quantitative measurement, from observation of the results, and from ascertaining the value perceived by students and their attitudes. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In the sociology of education the relation between education and work is analysed in many ways and, since the rise of neoliberalism, increasingly in market terms. Skills are the dominant labour market currency, described in terms of competence profiles that seek to link educational qualifications directly to work. Contrary to the widespread appeal of competence-based curriculum approaches, this paper argues that the vocationalist impulse of the neoliberal era impacts as negatively on technical and vocational education (TVET) as it does on general education in its destruction of a basis for curriculum that includes knowledge and not only skills. The paper draws on a recent empirical study of labour processes in four industry sectors in South Africa to show why work-related curricula need to foreground knowledge not just in terms of its applied qualities but as a necessary ingredient of technical systems complexity. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This scientific article presents the summarized contributions from the Movement and Language Workshops held at the University of Girona, as well as the projections derived from the intellectual spirit of generating scientific debate and the contributions from the open discussions. Movement must grow in an integral way, and it is a basic language that can articulate a kind of innovative and critical education imbued with emotional intelligence. It also allows active methodologies to be defined and applied in order to enhance and develop the competencies, skills and abilities at school which should promote individual, school, family and social ecosystems. Movement integrates the development of the aspects of intrapersonal and interpersonal relationships that contribute to an individual’s success and happiness. Likewise, the neuroscientific foundations that support the construction of movement which allows for relationships, actions and creativity are discussed. Based on this, the authors of this paper posit the need to develop motor skills as one of the key competencies at schools and other educational centers by incorporating the associated competencies of dance and all the arts to empower creativity and emotional learning. © Instituto Nacional de Educacion Fisica de Cataluna.

AB  - Professional communities are experiencing scandals involving unethical and illegal practices daily. Yet it should not take a national major structure failure to highlight the importance of ethical awareness and behavior, or the need for the development and practice of ethical behavior in engineering students. Development of ethical behavior skills in future engineers is a key competency for engineering schools as ethical behavior is a part of the professional identity and practice of engineers. While engineering educators have somewhat established instructional methods to teach engineering ethics, they still rely heavily on teaching ethical awareness, and pay little attention to how well ethical awareness predicts ethical behavior. However the ability to exercise ethical judgement does not mean that students are ethically educated or likely to behave in an ethical manner. This paper argues measuring ethical judgment is insufficient for evaluating the teaching of engineering ethics, because ethical awareness has not been demonstrated to translate into ethical behavior. The focus of this paper is to propose a model that correlates with both, ethical awareness and ethical behavior. This model integrates the theory of planned behavior, person and thing orientation, and spheres of control. Applying this model will allow educators to build confidence and trust in their students’ ability to build a professional identity and be prepared for the engineering profession and practice. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Today, experts agree that the level of cognitive development of modern young people affects the long-term life goals and outcomes that they set for themselves. During the course of numerous studies experts have identified such key competencies as problem solving, information literacy, and critical thinking. However, there are still many unanswered questions about what the components of these competencies are and how they should be evaluated. The aim of this article is to analyze the above competencies, to identify them within the context of different conceptual approaches, and to evaluate their significance for university graduates and the working population. In conclusion, we examine the basic difficulties encountered when developing tools for assessing the identified core competencies. © 2017, © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Numeracy is a key competency for living in our modern knowledge society. Therefore, it is essential to support numerical learning from basic to more advanced competency levels. From educational psychology it is known that learning is most effective when the respective content is neither too easy nor too demanding in relation to learners’ prerequisites. However, so far it is difficult to assess individual’s cognitive workload independently from performance to adapt learning environments accordingly. In the present study, we aim at identifying learners’ cognitive workload induced by addition tasks of varying difficulty using electroencephalography (EEG). To this end, a classifier using specific features in the EEG-signal is trained to differentiate between different levels of task difficulty significantly above chance level and with high consistency over all participants. Importantly, our model even allows for the prediction of cognitive demands induced by the addition tasks in a cross-participant approach. Closer inspection of the crucial EEG features indicates that oscillations in the theta and alpha band recorded from parietal electrodes are most reflective of current task difficulty. In summary, we are able to differentiate cognitive workload of participants independently from performance based on data of only a small number of electrodes. This suggests that a reduced EEG-setup combined with cross-participant classification may be a feasible approach to assess learners’ cognitive workload. © 2016, FIZ Karlsruhe.

AB  - A process model (cpm.4.CSE) is introduced that allows the development of competence models in computer science education related to curricular requirements. It includes eight subprocesses: (a) determine competence concept, (b) determine competence areas, (c) identify computer science concepts, (d) assign competence dimensions to computer science, (e) code competences, (f) formulate competences, (g) formulate learning tasks, and (h) formulate test tasks. The competence definition by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development gives the direction to cpm.4.CSE. This definition highlights four main dimensions of competence: knowledge, cognitive skills, practical skills, and attitudes. For the preparation of subprocesses and the exemplification of concepts, references have been used from the academic literature of computer science education. The processes, activities, and transformations of cpm.4.CSE are documented in Integration Definition for Function Modeling, a process modeling language that is standardized, widely used and easy to understand. © SAGE Publications.

AB  - Recognizing the need for a comprehensive, structured interview tool to select candidates for increasingly popular global health electives, we set out to invent a tool assessing global health competencies. Key competencies were selected based on predominance in literature and then were ranked based on necessity for successful global health educational experience through an online survey of experts in the field. A scoring system was created using these results, and a narrative-based interview guide was constructed to assess each of the global health competencies. Next steps include determining the value and reliability of the interview tool through a pilot study. © 2016, International Association of Medical Science Educators.

AB  - A utopia of sustainable development is becoming established on the international stage. To get there, varied and complementary strategies must come into play-among them education. This trend is turning to the "Social and Solidarity Economy" (SSE), especially since the approval by the United Nations (UN) of the 2030 Agenda; the fulfilment of which demands adult education strategies and programs in line with the principles and values of sustainability. This article offers a response to that demand. It aims to carry out a reflective analysis that reveals the similarities between the principles and values of the SSE and those guiding the UN's 2030 Agenda, with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Based on the results of this analysis, we will argue that training in the competencies for sustainability, essential in achieving the SDGs, is among the main functions of education within the SSE framework. Further, in order to make educational programs more sustainable, such training must be included in their operating objectives. The work uses a hermeneutic methodology based on the existing literature and gives particular attention to UNESCO's directives on training in key competencies for sustainability. The significant contribution the results make is to show: (a) the emphases of each approach and their similarities; (b) how the two are complementary; and (c) the potential, and need, for creating synergies based on their respective strengths. A further original contribution is a proposed basic guide for the design of training activities geared towards gaining the normative competency that UNESCO has identified as key to sustainability. This innovative proposal will be useful for improving the quality of adult training programs, thereby contributing to the achievement of the SDGs in communities. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: India is the first country to have mandated compulsory corporate social responsibility (CSR) spends through changes in its legislative framework. Focus has thus shifted from the “why” to the “how” of CSR and, therefore, a shift in the “locus” of CSR responsibility from the “influencer” chief executive officer toward the “implementer” CSR professionals. The purpose of this paper is to study the role of management education in developing individual competencies among the implementers and impacting effective CSR implementation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper, using a case study design, studies the role of management education in developing individual competencies among the implementers and impacting effective CSR implementation. Building on theoretical frameworks, this paper carries out an exploratory research of an Indian business school’s management education program for development practitioners. It uses qualitative inputs gathered from relevant stakeholders of the program to understand the role of management education in facilitating the paradigm shift in CSR in the Indian context. Findings: The paper finds that the program has impacted outcomes at three levels, namely through developing key individual CSR-related competencies; impacting participants’ professional performance; and organizational impact in effective CSR implementation. Practical implications: The case study provides a roadmap to business schools for designing and implementing programs for CSR professionals. Originality/value: Extant research in the Indian context is silent on key competencies required for CSR implementation and also on the role of management education in developing the same. Such competencies can ensure the efficiency of the expected large CSR spends by private corporates under the new legal requirements and alter the country’s social development path. © 2017, Tulsi Jayakumar and Rukaiya Kirit Joshi.

AB  - Nowadays, it focuses on fostering talented individuals that can adapt quickly to society instead of cultivating humanity and basic literacy. Therefore, this study focused on developing a new curriculum based on the NCS vocational skills, which is supported and implemented throughout the country. And, we were able to conduct a newly-developed curriculum by following the procedures of the mixed development model using the advantages of existing research papers. By following the procedures of mixed development model, we analyzed the General Education Curriculum in 2015 and the vocational competency needed throughout the entire course by its order of priority and importance, which were applied in the liberal arts curriculum in 2016. After operating the liberal arts curriculum in 2016, we conducted a feasibility evaluation of the new general education curriculum by evaluating the satisfaction of teachers, learners and expert group. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

AB  - During the last decade clinical simulation has expanded exponentially worldwide as a method to train and develop healthcare professionals. There is growing evidence supporting that clinical, communication and teamwork skills, as well as attitudes and professionalism learned through simulation-based training, seem transferable into the work environment more effectively when compared with traditional methods. Also, technology-enhanced simulation training is associated with improved outcomes and patient safety in comparison with other instructional modalities. To respond to this educational reform it is necessary to promote and facilitate the development of educators with the knowledge, skills, and abilities desired to deliver quality healthcare simulation activities. In this article we review and organise key competencies for simulation-based healthcare education, and a variety of programs currently offered for faculty development in clinical simulation. An analysis of the blueprint and process to implement a fellowship program in clinical simulation at Valdecilla Virtual Hospital, a simulation centre in Spain, is also made. © 2016 Elsevier España, S.L.U.

AB  - The Program for Reindustrialization of the Economy of Novosibirsk Oblast up to 2025 was prepared by a team of researchers at the Institute of Economics and Industrial Engineering of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IEIE SB RAS) on the assignment of the Oblast Administration. The article outlines the key features of the program and its architecture; the reindustrialization potential of the oblast economy is represented as nine integrated flagship projects reflecting key competencies of regional science and technology. Directions in the formation of the innovation and engineering belt based on the Novosibirsk Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences and academic research are presented. Special emphasis is placed on the strategic initiative for establishing a Siberian scientific cluster, which can become the country’s largest territory of priority innovative development. It is concluded that the Program for Reindustrialization of the Economy of Novosibirsk Oblast should be an essential element of strategic planning for the region and can be seen as an important federal pilot project, the implementation of which could serve for practical refinement in elements of interaction between government, business, and science to activate innovative directions of regional development. Public participation in the development of the program has revealed its great integration potential. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - ABSTRACT: To address the changing needs of the labour market better, higher education institutions have increasingly aimed to enhance their teaching quality and the learning experiences of their students. Therefore, a key concept of the missions of contemporary educational institutions is to improve students’ employability after graduation. Although extensive initiatives have been undertaken, educational mismatch remains intensely debated and may seriously challenge the greater use of limited human resources in Taiwan. In this study, a vocational-oriented department (baking) of a local well-known university was chosen for a case study. A holistic approach from student admission to entry in the labour market is adopted to analyse student learning, teaching, curriculum planning, and structural and enterprise demands to estimate the extent to which these graduates fit the requirement of employers. Research findings indicate multiple gaps in skill formation, intended labour needs, and career ladders. These gaps bring profound implications to questions about strengthening the linkage or transitioning from higher education to the labour market. © 2016 Association for Tertiary Education Management and the LH Martin Institute for Tertiary Education Leadership and Management.

AB  - In today’s knowledge society, there is a demand for professionals who are able to create knowledge across boundaries of disciplines, professions and perspectives. Traditional universities, universities of applied sciences and institutions for vocational education are all challenged to educate these knowledge workers. Accordingly, these institutions are developing competence-based education programmes that promote authentic, self-directed learning and the development of a professional identity. A possible environment for realising this type of learning is the hybrid learning configuration in which learning is embedded in ill-defined and highly-authentic tasks. This study attempted to identify a set of principles that can underpin the design of such a learning configuration at the interface between school and workplace. The research approach consisted of educational design research. Starting from cognitive constructivist and socio-cultural perspectives, a set of initial design principles was developed and evaluated from the perspective of the participants during three consecutive iterations of design and implementation. The process resulted in a set of seven refined design principles which can be used as heuristics to guide the design and development of hybrid learning configurations in contexts that have similar goals and aligned tenets. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - The notion of a global public service has been put forth in the literature as a means of addressing a number of policy issues that can no longer be addressed by a nation-state in isolation. This article sets out to address whether it is possible to formulate and implement a leadership competency model that could be used to select, develop and reward these global public servants and, if so, what leadership competencies they would require. Evidence will be drawn from both the literature on the competencies required for global managers/leaders as well as various public sector leadership competency models. It is argued that more thought needs to be given to how a leadership competency framework might be fruitfully employed to buttress such a cadre of individuals. Points for practitioners: Public services around the world have been embracing the use of leadership competency models as part of their human resources management frameworks for the past few decades. This research examines a number of the various models that have been employed with the intent of identifying key competencies that would be more universal in nature. Additional research needs to be conducted to ensure that such models reflect the distinctiveness of the public sector. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Introduction: The University of British Columbia Faculty of Dentistry developed a longitudinal curriculum pilot project to assess the usefulness of portfolios for dental students to develop reflective skills and demonstrate competency development, and to examine relationships between portfolio grades and clinical success. Materials and Methods: Students in one dental class created portfolios with reflections on examples relevant to eight selected competency statements each year of the program. As part of our program evaluation, we set out to look at trends in portfolio grades, meta-reflection skills, student and faculty views of the project, and relationships among portfolio grades, 4th year clinical grades and faculty rankings. Results: Portfolio grades improved from years 1 to 3, dropping off slightly in year 4. The highest level of internal consistency for grades within and between years occurred with Competency 42, while the lowest level occurred with Competency 4. Most students were able to demonstrate meta-reflection by 4th year. Students generally agreed with portfolios and reflection in concept, but suggested a looser structure, and they shared concerns with faculty about the workload involved. Portfolio grades did not correlate with clinical course grades (P = 0.092), but they did correlate significantly with faculty rankings except for year 1. Conclusion: While portfolio grades for reflections were not consistent, and they did not quite correlate with clinical course grades, they correlated strongly with faculty rankings. Future use of portfolios at UBC Dentistry will be enhanced by increasing curricular support regarding both competency development and the importance of reflection for professionals, decreasing workload by focusing on five Key Competencies, incorporating more formative and face-to-face feedback, and providing greater opportunities for peer sharing. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - In 2006, the European Union published its recommendations on competences for lifelong learning. Since then, key competences have been integrated into the official curriculum in Spain. The objectives of the present study are: a) to describe the strategies used most frequently by physical education teachers to incorporate key competences in their programmes; and b) to identify the profiles of teachers and schools that promote the inclusion of key competences in their physical education programmes. Data were collected via a questionnaire administered to a sample of 2051 physical education teachers in primary and secondary schools in Spain. The results show that while teachers include key competences in their programmes, they do not usually do so explicitly. The competences most frequently included are: social and citizenship skills; autonomy and personal initiative; learning to learn; and knowledge of, and interaction with, the physical world. To develop these competences, lesson plans often aim to integrate knowledge, skills and attitudes, apply problem-solving approaches, and foster the transfer of learning to everyday life. The lack of interdisciplinarity emerges as a negative aspect. Factors favouring the inclusion of competences are the provision of competence-based training for teachers and the presence of a coordination system for dealing with competences in the school. The conclusion drawn is that merely including key competences in the official curriculum is not enough; reinforcement and correction of all the aspects mentioned are essential to ensure that adequate attention is paid to competences in physical education programmes. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Introduction: Medical schools teach a broad overview of basic science and clinical skills in the first 2 years of medical school, with a focus on adult medicine. There is limited emphasis on childhood disease and interactions with children. Previous data illustrated pediatric clerkship directors perceive student preparedness for the pediatric clerkship to be inconsistent. We aimed to examine how pre-clinical experiences prepare medical students for their pediatric clerkship by creating a needs assessment to inform curriculum development. Methods: An anonymous survey was administered to 525 medical students completing their third year pediatrics rotations at four medical schools. Using a 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) scale, students rated their perception of how well their first 2 years of medical school prepared them for: the clerkship (overall), pediatric communication skills, age-appropriate physical exam skills, and pediatric-specific medical knowledge. Results: Thirty-three percent (33%) of respondents felt their pre-clinical education inadequately prepared them for their pediatric clerkship overall and 40% reported inadequate preparation for pediatric physical examination skills. Open-ended responses were qualitatively categorized into themes. The most frequent theme was a need for more pediatric-specific medical knowledge with the next highlighting more pediatric physical exam training. Discussion: One third or more of students in our study reported feeling inadequately prepared for their pediatric clerkship based on the first 2 years of medical school in several key competency areas, especially physical examination skills. Although variability in student responses exists between schools, these results suggest improvements in pre-clinical pediatric education are needed. © 2017, International Association of Medical Science Educators.

AB  - Guided by the social-emotional learning (SEL) framework, we studied developmental trajectory patterns of five key competency outcomes spanning middle through late childhood: altruism, empathy, self-efficacy, aggression, and hyperactivity. We then assessed their links to middle childhood home, parental, and community contexts. Data from the Institute of Education Sciences’ Social and Character Development Program, which comprised nearly 2,400 elementary school students who were followed from Grades 3 through 5, were analyzed using growth mixture modeling. Three trajectory groups emerged for each outcome, which were linked to childhood contexts. Positive parenting was associated with a lower likelihood of following a negative empathy trajectory among children. Neighborhood intergenerational closure promoted a stable self-efficacy trajectory. Residing in a high-risk community was linked to increasing normative beliefs about aggression. These findings suggest an important role of contexts in influencing childhood social-emotional development in the later elementary school years. © Society for Community Research and Action 2017

AB  - The relevance of this research is defined by a possibility of increase in efficiency of school students' research competence formation by means of robotics within fixed and extracurricular activities and additional education. The problem of a research is defined by a contradiction between widespread introduction of robotics in modern society life and insufficient techniques of studying robotics in order to key competences formation. The objective of this research is studying the didactic potential of robotics for school students' research competence formation and to offer the methodical approach to the organization of classes in robotics on the basis of research tasks and research projects. The article presents methods of studying robotics, the use of which helps to form the skills of independent research activities, as well as the ability to apply modern technology in solving practical problems. The article can be used by teachers of educational organizations and the organizations of additional education in preparation for robotics classes (in fixed and in extracurricular activities, in additional education); in analysis of teaching robotics methods, teachers of pedagogical universities to present the methodology of teaching robotics to the students, teaching staff of institutions of additional professional education in preparation for training courses. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - As in all professions, the practice of psychologists is based on the acquisition and application of knowledge, skills, and behaviors that are often conceptualized as competencies. As students progress through their curricula, they might approach each individual unit as a discrete set of skills embedded in different coursework units. However, these discrete skills and competencies may not reflect the diverse, interrelated, and complex nature of the practice of psychology. This project sought to identify the key competencies required to practice psychology and to present these competencies in a model that demonstrates how melding these competencies together better reflects authentic, real-world practice. The methodology comprised two stages. Pre-existing data, including detailed postgraduate course content, graduate course evaluations, and destinations such as vocational outcomes, from two universities were distributed to eight Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for consideration. During the first stage of the study, the eight SMEs engaged in a modified Delphi process designed to explore psychology competencies. The SME panel also answered several rounds of questions at first face-to-face, and later online. From these sessions, a draft psychology competency model was developed, including both competencies that are underpinned by the scientific-practitioner process, and meta- competencies. During the second stage of the study, practitioners and academics from various areas of psychology practice participated in a series of workshops and further refined the competency model. Future research is needed to validate the model. Elucidation of competencies in psychology is imperative and has ramifications for psychology regulation, training, and practice. © Copyright © 2017 von Treuer and Reynolds.

AB  - Foreign language lessons at school are designed to form key competences, with communicative competence being an important one, implying students' ability and readiness to communicate in a foreign language. However, there are difficulties in mastering the foreign language. As before, the main ones are: the lack of active oral practice, the absence of the environment for foreign language communication, and the presentation of educational material in textbooks without taking into account the principle of individualization and differentiation of education. The solution to this problem is possible through applying the ideas of developmental teaching at the lesson. The purpose of this study is to substantiate theoretically and test experimentally the effectiveness of using the ideas of developmental learning at the foreign language lessons to develop students' communicative competence. The leading method of the research is a pedagogical experiment aimed at revealing the level of the development of students' communicative competence. The content analysis of foreign language textbooks was also used to identify potential options to apply ideas of developmental learning. Results of the research: The article presents a selection of topical projects aimed at students' partially exploring and research activities that form the communicative competence directly; there were developed lessons to introduce the ideas of the developmental teaching at the lesson. It is proved that the projects assembled in the textbook contribute to building interdisciplinary connections, stimulate the development of the communicative competence and, on the whole, favour the development of the student's personality. Relevance of the study: The study proved the effectiveness of using the ideas of the developmental teaching to develop students' communicative competence. The materials of the article can be used to improve the process of teaching the foreign language at the secondary school; developed and tested different topical projects can be used by teachers of the foreign language in class. © 2018 by Academic Publishing.

AB  - Using iconic images created by students in Belfast and Sarajevo of their respective cities, this paper will explore how emerging ideas in the field of cognitive science (e.g. Gallagher, S. 2005. How the Body Shapes the Mind. Oxford: Clarendon Press) can help explain the making and understanding of Augusto Boal’s ‘Image Theatre’. There has been growing interest in the intersection between performance and cognitive science (McConachie, B., and H. E. Hart, eds. 2006. Performance and Cognition: Theatre Studies after the Cognitive Turn. Routledge), particularly in terms of kinaesthetic empathy (Reynolds, D., and M. Reason, eds. 2012. Kinaesthetic Empathy in Creative and Cultural Practices. Intellect), which can enhance our understanding of the embodied practices associated with Augusto Boal’s Image Theatre. This paper will analyse the ambiguities inherent in stage images of contested cities to explore how these may reveal unconscious insights into the image-makers’ perception of their home environments. An image of Sarajevo, for instance, ostensibly about the Winter Olympics, prompts consideration of the city’s internal divisions. An image of Belfast, ostensibly about the Titanic, suggests the limitations of the city’s Peace Process. Taking Boal’s idea that stage images should be felt rather than read, this article explores the fine line between feeling and meaning in the understanding of Image Theatre and suggests that alongside literacy and orality we now also need to include ‘imageracy’, the ability to interpret and understand images, as a key competency for the modern world. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background Communication and teamwork skills in interprofessional education are key competencies for ensuring safe patient outcomes. Simulation is a safe environment in which to foster and develop such skills. Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate a program of communication and team skill development in a sequential set of interprofessional simulations for pre-licensure nursing and medical students. Method A prospective, repeated measures design was employed to determine whether team training at the beginning of a longitudinal interprofessional had an effect on subsequent performances in interprofessional communication and teamwork skills. Student teams engaged in an interprofessional simulation once a semester for four semesters. Discussion Targeted team training improved communication and teamwork skills in interprofessional nursing and medicine student teams. Conclusions Team training through simulation is an effective means to develop and sustain communication and teamwork skills in interprofessional student teams. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - While federal action on climate change and renewable energy development has lagged in the United States, cities are undertaking ambitious sustainability initiatives. Motivation often flows from a resilience mindset - how cities can prepare for and be resilient to future shocks. The conflation of sustainability and resilience jeopardizes the success of sustainability efforts and limits their scope. Institutionalizing sustainability in city governments requires building capacity for city leadership to link sustainability and resilience objectives. This article builds on previous work in sustainability education to demonstrate how key competencies, or ways of thinking, in sustainability can be adapted for use with city leadership. The article introduces a novel board game entitled Future Shocks and City Resilience as a method for creating an interactive educational environment that facilitates learning while contributing to cultural change within a city administration. The game was played with leadership from the City of Tempe, Arizona. Results from analyzing the game play indicate that the game encourages participants to utilize sustainability in ways of thinking at a novice level. Recommendations include how cities can utilize this and other capacity-building tools to develop intermediate and advanced sustainability competence among their staffs. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - This article examines Japanese education system especially relevant to the school curriculum, which might support Japanese high performance in the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), mainly through Japanese policy documents. The Japanese education systems have been constructed by the local context of society and politics, and it is hard to analyse the reasons why Japan has seen better results in the previous PISA assessments than other OECD countries. However, the 2008–2009 revision of the Course of Study (the national curriculum in Japan) shows that the Japanese government was really concerned about the decline of Japan's ranking in the previous PISA assessments and revised the Course of Study in response to children's skills which the PISA aimed to measure (key competencies). The Japanese government has placed importance on the cultivation of human resources which are necessary to compete within the international community, and the PISA has had a large effect on the direction of Japanese education. © 2016 British Educational Research Association.

AB  - Through the New Skills for New Jobs initiative, the European Commission wants to (1) promote better anticipation of future skills needs, (2) develop better matching between skills and labour market needs and (3) bridge the gap between the worlds of education and work. With relatively little effort, the use of lingua receptiva can contribute significantly towards achieving these goals. Including it in the Skills Agenda as a "transversal skill"could:- enhance the key competence "Communicating in and learning a foreign language"; - refine the European Qualification Framework (EQF); and, - strengthen the Europass.

AB  - This article Describes Some Issues Concerning The Use Of Robots In primary school as an object and subject of learning. The authors conclude, based on an analysis of earlier research as well as their own study, that educational robots can stimulate learners' learning motivation. Compared with other media, programmable bricks provide children with the opportunity to create their own products and, through this process, to express creative thinking. Studies have found that learning robotics or integrating programming bricks into courses can help to develop students' problem-solving abilities and enhance their learning performance. Besides, an analysis is presented of basic legal regulations in this matter, primary school curricula as well as some results of a survey conducted in Poland and Ukraine among in-service teachers and prospective teachers.

AB  - The increasing availability of new technologies in an ever more digitalized world has gained momentum in practically all spheres of life, making technology-related skills a key competence not only in professional settings. Thus, schools assume responsibility for imparting these skills to their students, and hence to future generations of professionals. In so doing, teachers play a key role with their competences in using new technologies constituting an essential prerequisite for the effective implementation of such skills. As models of school development and school effectiveness found teacher professionalization to be a key element with regards to student achievement as well as teachers’ in-class use of new technology, the present research project conducts secondary analyses using data from the IEA International Computer and Information Literacy Study 2013 (ICILS 2013) regarding internal and external teacher professionalization. Particular emphasis is placed on the implementation of new technologies in class in a comparison between the education systems of Germany and the Czech Republic. A Latent Class Analysis serves the purpose of establishing a teacher typology with regards to technology-related professional development. This typology is subsequently used for further analyses of additional factors that show a correlation with the teachers’ use of computers in class. These include the teachers’ ICT self-efficacy and their emphasis on teaching ICT skills. The results show two different types of teachers across both countries. Teachers who participate in professional development use computers more frequently in class, put more emphasis on teaching ICT skills and have a stronger sense of ICT self-efficacy. When comparing teachers in Germany and the Czech Republic, teachers in Germany who participate in professional development consider themselves more ICT self-efficient, while teachers in the Czech Republic use computers more often and put more emphasis on teaching ICT skills compared with their colleagues in Germany. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Competency-based medical education systems allow institutions to individualize teaching practices to meet the needs of diverse learners. Yet, the focus on continuous improvement and individualization of curricula does not exempt programs from treating learners in a fair manner. When learners fail to meet key competencies and are placed on probation or dismissed from training programs, issues of fairness may form the basis of their legal claims. In a literature search, we found no in-depth examination of fairness. In this paper, we utilize a systems lens to examine fairness within postgraduate medical education contexts, focusing on educational opportunities, assessment practices, decision-making processes, fairness from a legal standpoint, and fairness in the context of the learning environment. While we provide examples of fairness issues within US training programs, concerns regarding fairness are relevant in any medical education system which utilizes a competency-based education framework. Assessment oversight committees and annual programmatic evaluations, while recommended, will not guarantee fairness within postgraduate medical education programs, but they can provide a window into ‘hidden’ threats to fairness, as everything from training experiences to assessment practices may be examined by these committees. One of the first steps programs can take is to recognize that threats to fairness may exist in any educational program, including their own, and begin conversations about how to address these issues. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - This study deals with the interactional achievement of laughter in WhatsApp conversations. We aim to describe how texters mobilize “transcribed” laughter (i.e. hahaha), and to what extent laughter is a resource for managing the interactional contingencies linked to the asynchronous nature of the written conversations in which participants are engaged. Using both a conversation analytic approach and quantification, we analyzed 43 WhatsApp conversations collected in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. By focusing on the position of laughter in a message, its sequential position, and the management of turn allocation before and after a message that contains laugh particles, we show that participants recurrently produce volunteered and unilateral laughs combined with assessments as responsive actions. However, depending on the position of laughter in the message and its sequential organization, participants orient to different courses of action. The first pattern includes standalone unilateral laughter (i.e. the message is composed only of laugh particles) that is followed by another message by the same speaker, in which he/she produces an assessment, leading to sequence closing and topic termination. In the second pattern, the speaker laughs in turn-initial position before producing an assessment in the same message; in this case, the next message is performed by the partner, providing him/her with the opportunity to prolong the ongoing topic. Laughter is thus a powerful resource in that it allows participants to orient to interactional moments that are particularly delicate to manage, especially in asynchronous conversations: message-taking and sequence closing/topic termination. Laughter thus opens a window onto how participants display expertise in the management of WhatsApp conversations. Given the impact that asynchronous exchanges may have in social life, the ability to exhibit an identity of “doing being” an expert of new communication technologies appears to be a key competence that deserves further investigation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper analyses the bibliometric characteristics of 616 journal articles on key competences indexed in ERIC in a 23-year-period following documentary analysis. This observation method allowed us to highlight key elements like the population, educational level, topics, etc. to focus whether this literature contributes towards implementing competence-based education. The findings of key competence-based articles confirm that competence discourse in education has become a highly rated topic of debate from 1999 to 2013. In the two last decades, there has been a gradual increase in articles based on research combined with a decline in articles of a descriptive nature. The main contributions of articles on competency-based education are significantly in line with topics related to reflection on competence discourse and education policies that should be implemented. There is still a clear need for publications which provide examples and empirical evidence aimed at developing basic competences. © 2017 Association for Teacher Education in Europe.

AB  - Background: Clinical reasoning is a key competence in medicine. There is a lack of knowledge, how non-experts like medical students solve clinical problems. It is known that they have difficulties applying conceptual knowledge to clinical cases, that they lack metacognitive awareness and that higher level cognitive actions correlate with diagnostic accuracy. However, the role of conceptual, strategic, conditional, and metacognitive knowledge for clinical reasoning is unknown. Methods: Medical students (n = 21) were exposed to three different clinical cases and instructed to use the think-aloud method. The recorded sessions were transcribed and coded with regards to the four different categories of diagnostic knowledge (see above). The transcripts were coded using the frequencies and time-coding of the categories of knowledge. The relationship between the coded data and accuracy of diagnosis was investigated with inferential statistical methods. Results: The use of metacognitive knowledge is correlated with application of conceptual, but not with conditional and strategic knowledge. Furthermore, conceptual and strategic knowledge application is associated with longer time on task. However, in contrast to cognitive action levels the use of different categories of diagnostic knowledge was not associated with better diagnostic accuracy. Conclusions: The longer case work and the more intense application of conceptual knowledge in individuals with high metacognitive activity may hint towards reduced premature closure as one of the major cognitive causes of errors in medicine. Additionally, for correct case solution the cognitive actions seem to be more important than the diagnostic knowledge categories. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - The starting points of this initial exploratory study are two research questions: (1) could marketing relationships in international marketing channels be predicted by international marketing managers' behavior reflected by "honorable merchants'" key concepts (ethics and trust) and experiential learning key concepts such as capability and competence?; and (2) can we measure the progress of this research theme in the international marketing literature and understand the nature of this phenomenon? We examine how scholarly research on international marketing managers' behavior and their marketing relationships evolved from 2003 to 2013 and envisage the shape of this research theme the next years, to uncover current trends and possible research gaps on the ethics agenda in the international marketing education area. We identified the most salient concepts from 2,083 words for 22 key concepts counted in the abstracts of the 327 journal articles of the international marketing literature, in order to innovatively uncover the trends and concepts, explaining the marketing relationships in the international marketing context. We assessed sets of concepts that best reflect the marketing relationships in international marketing channels and indicated prospects for increasing the focus on specific topics, by conducting a series of multiple linear regression analyses and trend analyses. The research results show that the progress of the research theme can be measured. Innovatively, key competences and capabilities of international marketing managers relating to the key concepts of the "honorable merchant" construct are realized as a strong logical basis for the explanation of effective marketing relationships in international marketing channels. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This article focuses on the analysis of the current state of the key competence development of adults in Lithuania. The following key competences are analysed: communication in native tongues and foreign languages, development of cultural awareness, entrepreneurship, application of information society technologies, and learning to learn. The research involved analysis of the definition and role of the key competences, discussing their typologies and revealing the preconditions, factors and approaches to the development of the key competences. Results of the quantitative survey involving 6992 adult respondents in Lithuania showed that the key competences are important for the majority of the research sample in their social, work and personal life. Individualised ways of key competence development are applied more frequently than collective ways. Key competence development is mostly enhanced by personal needs (work, wish of development and self-realization) and support of the family. The most frequently mentioned obstacles to the development of key competences are lack of financial resources and expensive training services. © Wydawnictwo Adam Marszałek Toruń 2017.

AB  - Drawing upon the work of Foucault and Latour, this article reflects on 25 years of critique of competence-based education and its continuing strength as a way of framing education and training. Using an example from England, it rehearses the argument from Foucault that, despite its student-centred discourse, competence-based education can be positioned as one of the disciplining techniques in modern societies. However, beyond the research community, such critiques have had little impact. The article seeks to explore this by drawing upon Latour’s argument that conventional forms of critique have run out of steam. This indicates the need for new forms of educational critique as a means of having impact on policy and practice. The article is theoretically driven and exploratory. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In the discourse on diversity in colleges and universities in the United States, an often-neglected population is nontraditional adult learners. This article explores this invisible aspect of undergraduate diversity, and addresses how competence-based education, which focuses on demonstrating the actual ability to do, is an innovative approach that caters to adult learners’ life phase and learning needs. College arguably is a youth-centric phase of life generally designed for the younger student. However, the stereotypical full-time student who lives on campus is actually a small percentage of the entire postsecondary population. Due to the demands of an increasingly competitive world of work, nontraditional adult learners will continue to seek out postsecondary education. Unfortunately, the credit hour system is a significant barrier for both entry and success of adult learners. Merits of competence-based education are discussed, and implications are provided to best meet this significant component of student diversity. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - This article presents a practical example of the implementation of learning portfolios as a means to assessing competence in translator training. Details are given of how a portfolio may be used for both formative and summative assessment; the stages of competence development at which assessment should take place; and the criteria used for assessing the outcome of activities designed to develop translation competence. The results obtained are presented and discussed. The example presented shows that learning portfolios are the instruments of choice for assessing the progressive development of competence in trainee translators. They encourage learner autonomy, reflective and critical thinking and self-assessment, and the tasks set mobilise all the competences required to successfully develop translation competence. The use of learning portfolios, however, requires close collaboration between trainers and trainees, and a sustained effort to establish, and apply, effective competence assessment criteria. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The issue undertaken in this article concentrates on entrepreneurship as the key competence of the teachers of preschool and early school children in Poland. A hypothesis was made that developing this competence in the course of professional teacher training is the condition of effective children education. For this purpose, an online survey was conducted with a sample of 232 head teachers of schools and kindergartens (public and private ones). The presented results of the research tackle expectations of employers towards recruited teachers with regards to this competence. Accomplishment of the research project allowed for formulating recommendations for teacher training within the framework of education for entrepreneurship by indicating directions and areas of implementing necessary changes. © Wydawnictwo Adam Marszałek Toruń 2017.

AB  - Background General practitioners (GPs) are among the specialists who prescribe the highest number of medication. Therefore the improvement of pharmacological competencies is an important part of the GP specialist training. The self-concept of general practice stating that GPs are the first contact persons for all health problems makes it challenging to define and acquire competencies for specialist training. While the “Competence-based Curriculum” developed by the German College of General Practitioners and Family Physicians defines diagnoses, reasons for counselling and competencies which are essential for general practice, a similar orientation guide is lacking for the pharmacological field. The aim of this study is to define and characterize pharmacological substances which every GP should know so well that he or she is able to conduct counselling and monitoring. Methods We analysed private and public health insurance prescriptions of all general practices participating in the CONTENT project in the period from 2009 to 2014. The analysis was limited to substances with oral application which were prescribed at least once by at least 25 % (n = 11) of the practices. While the 100 most frequent prescriptions were included due to their frequency, less frequently prescribed substances were assessed concerning their relevance for general practice in a rating procedure. The substances included were classified by diagnoses and reasons for counselling. Results We analysed 1,912,896 prescriptions from 44 practices and 112,535 patients on the basis of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. After applying the inclusion criteria, 453 substances were left, 302 of which were considered relevant for general practice and could be assigned to 45 diagnoses / reasons for counselling. Conclusions The result of this study could be considered a working draft for a pharmacological curriculum for general practice, which may complement the “Competence-based Curriculum” in the medium term. © 2017

AB  - The aim of this study is to develop a scale to measure primary and secondary school teachers' perception of a competence-based curriculum model in Spain. After reviewing the literature, we designed an initial questionnaire with 37 five-point Likert-type items. This was then reviewed by a panel of experts. A pilot test was conducted with 100 participants using exploratory factor analysis. This resulted in a final scale with 23 items across five factors (beliefs about the theoretical model, level of implementation of the model, difficulties in implementing the model, resources and professional development). To verify, using new data, the level of fit of the measurement model generated by the first sample, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis, and, subsequently, a confirmatory factor analysis with structural equations on a sample of 1408 respondents. Acceptable levels of internal consistency and model fit were obtained. The result is a scale which is rapidly and easily administered. It demonstrates good criterion validity in explaining teachers' beliefs about the competence-based curriculum model, and thus reveals teachers' perceptions of the impact of this curricular reform. © NAER Journal of New Approaches in Educational Research 2018.

AB  - Global sustainability problems pose serious challenges for humanity. In handling these problems education for sustainable development (ESD) is seen as important. Different key competences that ESD should focus on have been introduced, such as the ability to deal with future dimensions. Still, studies indicate that future dimensions are not always included in ESD and that many young people are pessimistic concerning the global future. Therefore, one could argue that a focus on anticipatory emotions, especially hope, should be included in ESD. There is a worry, however, that hope will lead to unrealistic optimism and/or less engagement. The aim of this paper is to problematize the discussion about hope in relation to ESD and the global future by grounding it in theories from different disciplines and in empirical research about young people, hope, and climate change. The review shows that hope is a complex, multifaceted, and sometimes contested concept. Hope can be related to denial, but in other cases it can help people face and do something constructive with their worries about the global future. The close relation between hope and trust is emphasized and a need for critical emotional awareness in ESD is argued for. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In an era of global changes, flexible thinking is a key competency, necessary for learning in technology-enhanced environments. Advancements in instructional science and educational technologies call for an updated conceptualization of 'flexible thinking' to address current educational challenges. Echoing this need, the goal of this study was to re-conceptualize flexible thinking and to generate a valid and reliable instrument for measuring an individual's inclination to think flexibly in contemporary learning situations. A Six-stage study was designed to assess and validate the new instrument. As a result, the Flexible Thinking in Learning (FTL) scale was generated, consisting of three subscales: Acceptance of new or changing technologies, Open-mindedness to others' ideas, and Adapting to changes in learning situations. Within the framework of the current study, findings confirmed the FTL scale's content, construct, and concurrent validity, indicating stability across populations and over time. Consequently, the FTL scale may serve as both a research instrument and a self-assessment tool. It may assist in the evaluation of learners' inclination to think flexibly or in explaining individual differences regarding the utilization of new learning methods. Yet, generalizability should be carefully considered and additional studies should be conducted to examine the FTL scale among learners from different age groups and academic background. © 2016 2016 The Authors.

The aim of the research was to determine what competencies of art teachers are needed for school work and professional and proactive role in the society and what the possibilities of their professional development are. The research sample included 220 art teachers working in primary and secondary school. Results indicate that initial teacher education to large extent determines their teaching preferences, as well as that many respondents recognise art teachers’ competencies as essential for their work at school and social community. It is noted that a small number of art teachers participate in school projects, experimental programmes, teachers’ associations, and that they are largely involved only in the work of school teams. It can be concluded that their professional development needs to be focused towards the development of sensitivity for the identification and understanding of different professional and social patterns and roles, towards social interaction and involvement in various school teams and teachers’ associations, through which they can provide themselves with a source of support and resources for their work. © 2018, Institute for Educational Research.

AB  - The relevance of the research problem is due to the fact that in foreign language education one-sidedness is viewed, because there is no fixed experience of emotional-valuable relations. As a consequence, their implementation in foreign language education occurs randomly and intuitively. The purpose of the article is to carry out the selection of elements contributing to the formation of students' emotional-valuable relations. The leading approach to the investigation is modelling. The article presents a selection of elements in the content of foreign language education, contributing to the formation of students' emotional-valuable the experience. It is revealed that their joint modelling and functioning allows to achieve the goal of forming a free, developed, educated person that holds the key competencies, man of culture, its creator. The model of formation of students' emotional-valuable relations in foreign language education is introduced. The article can be useful for training foreign language teachers in order to make the learning process on the subject student-oriented, and the content of foreign language education -emotional-valuable. © 2016 by iSER, International Society of Educational Research.

AB  - This article shows efficacy of competences-oriented education model, representing effectiveness of pedagogy technology and digital tools blending in transforming education while using tutor’s support. In correspondence to contemporary requirements and education system special features, connection between digital education tools and tutor technology contributing to students’ key competences development is determined. The paper contributes to the field by summarizing some theoretical issues and offering implementation suggestions for effectively integrating digital technologies into teaching and learning. The use of digital technologies in educational activities opens up new opportunities, adequate methods for dissemination and management of digital information, development of necessary competencies on the basis of digital literacy, ensuring equitable access for all who wish to obtain necessary knowledge and decision-making skills, ensuring demand for school graduates in the world labor market in situation of digital economy. Innovative technologies become a problem adding difficulties to students’ burden. Tutor becomes an intermediary between students and digital technologies to promote students’ active learning practices; there are not so many students who can appreciate digital learning practices and get the most of it. The role of tutoring in digital literacy promotion is hard to overestimate. Tutor support is a pedagogical activity in individualization of education aimed at identifying and developing students’ educational motives and interests. To form students’ key competencies in education system, it is necessary to supplement traditional education with tools of digital educational technologies, new trends in pedagogies such as tutoring, which is becoming an integral part of modern learning process. © 2018 IJCRSEE.

AB  - Upper-secondary school students must prepare for adult life, which - among others - entails acquiring relevant skills and discovering their own potential. Efforts at European and national levels have been made to ensure that students gain the competences, the so-called key competences, which facilitate functioning in the modern world. However, in Polish uppersecondary schools their overall development may be problematic as schoolwork is heavily exam-oriented. In order to address this challenge, a study was undertaken, the aim of which was to investigate the usefulness and feasibility of applying gamification to an extracurricular CLIL project intended to develop key competences in an upper-secondary school. The paper reports on one part of this study, i.e. on how a biology challenge (two tasks) was designed, implemented and evaluated. The results show educational and emotional gains, suggesting the motivational effect of gamification in learning.

AB  - The article describes an original approach to training of technical translators. The authors present a model describing formation of translation competences in students/graduates of nonlinguistic higher schools which has been tested throughout 15 years in the Engineering Academy of the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia. Key competences of technical translators were defined, examined and systematized. In particular, these include intercultural, communicative, special, social and personal competence. The authors propose a phased approach to the formation of translation competences during fulfillment of relevant tasks by translators. This gave the possibility to point out four main training stages – professional orientation, analysis, synthesis and correction. Each tasks referring to the above stages formed the basis of the original training modules which include the following components: tasks, ways of its solution, relevant competences and external assets, certain exercises developed to check formedness of relevant knowledge and skills in the field of technical translation. The developed model has an important feature which implies integration of knowledge and skills referring to a particular industry in students/graduates of higher educational institutions. © 2017, Slovenska Vzdelavacia Obstaravacia.

AB  - The reference to the corpus of texts and corpus technologies as a means of foreign language teaching is one of the actual directions for improving the teaching methodology. The corpus is characterized by representativeness, visibility and provides the teacher of foreign languages with broad search possibilities that allow creating various models of forming the key competencies of the student. The purpose of this study is to theoretically substantiate and empirically confirm the effectiveness of the methodology for the formation of the lexical skills of students in German with the application of corpus technologies. The analysis of existing approaches to tasks construction using corpus technologies allowed the authors of the study to construct their own complex oft asks consisting of three blocks. For each block the tools (concordance, statistical capabilities of the corpus, dictionary) was chosen, with the help of which either the teacher develops the tasks, or the students independently work with a corpus of texts under the guidance of the teacher. To determine the effectiveness of the corpus technologies-assisted methodology for the formation of lexical skills in academic years 2015-2016, an educational experiment was conducted at L. Tolstoy Higher School of Russian and Foreign Philology of the Institute of Philology and Intercultural Communication of Kazan Federal University. Comparative analysis of the formation of lexical skills among the students of control and experimental groups at the ascertaining and control stages of the experiment has proved the effectiveness of the method of forming lexical skills using corpus technologies. The results of the research contribute to the development of web-didactics and DDL (training oriented to these corpora), a set of developed tasks can be an incentive to more intensive use of corpus technologies in foreign language teaching.

AB  - The study generalizes the concept of cultural intelligence (CQ) as a key competency in Indian context due to its diverse cultures. Cultural intelligence is a capability, which increases the manager’s ability to effectively interact with people belonging to other cultures. The purpose of the study is to examine the mediating role of cross-cultural adaptability (CCA) in between CQ and the job performance relationship and the moderating role played by work experience and language proficiency in between CQ and CCA relationship. The data for the study have been collected from 342 managers of nationalized banks in Jammu and Kashmir (India). Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis have been conducted to explore and validate the factor of different constructs. Hypotheses have been tested through structural equation modeling. The study reveals that CCA mediates the relationship between CQ and job performance. Further, previous work experience and language ability act as moderators between the CQ and CCA relationship. Further, moderated mediation analysis also confirmed significant indirect effect. Implications and limitations of the study have also been discussed. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - The job expectations and requirements of the information age bring with them a need for a change in teaching and studying. A quantitative approach to working with information and a frontal style of teaching, still a wide practice in many institutions, no longer seem to be suitable preparation for current students' needs. One of the areas affected by these changes are the foreign language competences necessary to efficiently deal with study and job related practices and, correspondingly, to succeed in the job market. Along with the change in student needs comes the demand for change in the organization of language classrooms and instruction. Young people, facing a deluge of information and unlimited access to resources, are challenged by the changing needs in processing the material. A qualitative approach to information is required with a growing focus on information processing, analysis, critical evaluation and implementation in practice. Similarly, the need for efficient communication skills such as negotiation, argumentation or presenting seem to be more in demand than grammatical precision or encyclopedic knowledge. From this perspective, language instruction accentuating activities focused on memorizing and drills needs to be restructured so the students can develop targeted key competences for the current times. This paper focuses on the research of student needs and how they are perceived from the perspective of students and their study or internship experience, as well as from the perspective of teacher practitioners. The purpose of the study is to identify the key competences students need to succeed in the job market as a resource for restructuring university language instruction. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.

AB  - Reflection is considered necessary and beneficial within career learning and is deemed to be a condition for successful career-identity development. Indeed, reflection is generally seen as a key competency in learning how to respond effectively to a complex and dynamic post-modern world in which individuals are increasingly exposed to risk. Paradoxically however, reflection can itself form a risk when it results in rumination. It is therefore important to identify the conditions and personal (risk) factors that make reflection a detrimental or beneficial activity and to identify elements within career-learning interventions that promote benefit. The purpose here is to increase awareness about reflective versus ruminative processes and promote responsible use of interventions that aim to stimulate reflection in the process of career-identity formation. Based on the “career writing” method, the authors conclude that a successful career intervention must especially provide good facilitation and a safe holding environment. © Australian Council for Educational Research 2016.

AB  - This article analyses the conformity of the educational action research (EAR) process for the improvement of selected competencies that will be necessary in the near future for each active and responsible person. The most requested competencies in the near and midterm future are determined in accordance with near future structural requirements of labour demand, determined by international organoizations. The contribution is based upon the outcomes of the action research carried out in the internet environment, by Bachelor students majoring in information technologies at Riga Technical University, Latvia. Working in groups, they supplemented each other's ideas, developing living theories. The content analysis of the students' supplementary submissions and living theories was carried out to identify the features indicating the development of student actions towards the improvement of the most necessary competencies in the near future. To accomplish the objective of action research, at first, the most requested competencies in the near and midterm future were determined. Then the changes of the features, mentioned during the three action research cycles were identified. Finally, the most important features of the students' actions indicating the development of two of key competencies, namely, Novel and adaptive thinking and Design Mindset, were identified. Perfection of referred competencies is viewed as the substantial part of education for sustainable development (ESD). The conclusions were drawn about the development of students' competencies according to the future needs identified during the action research process on the internet. © by Janis Kapenieks 2016.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe, reflect on, and problematize the curricula and student support created by the Writing Program at DePaul University’s School for New Learning. This case study discusses the challenges and considerations that the authors have used to develop writing classes and support for non-traditional adult students. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative case study emerges from the practical experience and theoretical knowledge of the three authors. The experience includes development, implementation, and revision of curricula and support services to fit the changing needs of the non-traditional student population. Findings: The growing majority of students demonstrate at least one non-traditional characteristic: delayed postsecondary education enrollment, lack of high school diploma, part-time enrollment, full-time employment, multiple dependents besides a spouse, etc. In the face of institutional indifference, these populations frequently fail to receive the support that meets their particular needs. Practical implications: Using their own experience of creating a Writing Program that meets the needs of adult non-traditional students, the authors discuss practical strategies for and possible pitfalls of providing writing support that can be adapted for similarly underserved student populations. Originality/value: The paper does present interesting approaches for educating adult students. It covers the unique challenges in this population, and the the approaches that are specifically tailored toward meeting their needs. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to design and validate an assessment tool to find out how primary school students perceive their competency-based learning. By examining the content validity (n = 35 experts), comprehension (n = 173 students) and construct (n = 523 students) of the instrument, the results showed correct psychometric quality, internal consistency, reliability and adequacy of the structural model: χ2/df = 2.08, TLI = 0.88, CFI = 0.90, GFI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.04, and SRMR = 0.04. The final version of the Questionnaire on Perceived Competency-based Learning of primary school students (#ICOMpri1) includes eight dimensions and 27 items. The results showed a high perceived competency-based learning of primary school students. This is therefore a valid and reliable instrument that provides a more subjective and real vision of primary students' academic performance. Nevertheless, future studies should analyse the criterion-related validity by comparing perception results with those of international academic achievement. © 2017 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.

AB  - Recent government moves in many countries have seen coding included in school curricula, or promoted as part of computing, mathematics or science programmes. While these moves have generally been associated with a need to engage more young people in technology study, research has hinted at possible benefits from learning to program including fostering general thinking skills. However, little research has been carried out exploring these ideas. This study analysed data collected while 5- and 6-year-old students in a New Zealand primary school were using Scratch Jnr. to learn about basic shapes, as part of a numeracy topic. Analysis combined Brennan and Resnick's (2012) computational thinking skills framework and Krathwohl's (2002) revision of Bloom's Taxonomy to evaluate any role general thinking skills played in these students' coding work. Results suggest including basic coding in primary curricula provides teachers with an effective means of exercising their students' general and higher order thinking skills. They build on Brennan and Resnick's (2012) framework by including conceptualization as an important element in students' computational work and highlight the role of predictive thinking in debugging code. Findings support historical arguments that more needs to be done to investigate students' cognitive processes when undertaking computational work. Lay description: What is already known about the topic: Computational learning is an emerging area of school curricula; Limited research exists exploring thinking processes within computational learning; Early studies challenge more recent claims of thinking skill transfer from computational work. What this paper adds: Computational work supports a range of general and higher order thinking skills; Task design and teacher skills are critical to achieving higher order thinking outcomes from computational work; Computational work in teams can support collaborative, cooperative and self-management key competencies. Implications for practice and/or policy: Findings broaden the base of empirical support for including computational work in school curricula; Coding provides an engaging means of exercising complex thinking skills and key competencies in students; The data methods used provide teachers with visible evidence of students' thinking processes during computational work. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The social and interactive dimension has taken on particular relevance with the appearance of new technologies in education, making the capacity for virtual empathy a key competence for promoting learning processes in virtual environments. Therefore, we conducted a study based on a survey with 704 students who were training as teachers, to whom we applied an adaptation of the empathy scale designed by Gorostiaga et al. (Revista de Educación 364, 12–38, 2014). The study shows a valid and reliable measure of virtual empathy. Results indicate that only 10 % of the sample reached a high level of virtual empathy and, for this reason, we believe it should be included in teacher education syllabuses. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - The basis of the submitted study are the continuously rising demands to alter the curricula with the aim to develop students' key competences in order to increase their professional versatility. The lack of scientific research and discussions show that little investigation has been done on the issue of development of key competences. Therefore, the primary objective of our study is to present the teaching methodology, the process of creating the educational model and the pilot verification aimed at the development of key competences through interactive whiteboard in the subject of Technology. The partial results of the pilot research conducted on the research sample of 6th and 8th grade students of primary schools on Slovakia show its usefulness especially in the development of teamwork, in terms of interpersonal competences, problem solving in terms of learning competences and reading comprehension in terms of communication competences. The presented educational model reflects the contemporary requirements in terms of using information and communication technologies in the teaching of the subject of Technology, in which the acquisition of key competences becomes considerably important.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to examine and compare faculty perceptions of the process of institutionalizing sustainability, developing sustainability pedagogy and activating key sustainability competencies between the University of Oklahoma (OU) and Arizona State University (ASU). Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 professors in the Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability at OU and 10 professors in the School of Sustainability at ASU. Findings: The results highlight the complexity of teaching sustainability in an interdisciplinary manner in both programs. Professors are incorporating many of the key competencies of sustainability teaching, but in a patchwork manner that does not necessary follow the comprehensive frameworks from the literature. Practical implications: The comparative analysis leads to recommendations for teaching sustainability in higher education. Originality/value: This study contributes to theories of sustainability teaching by identifying gaps between what professors are actually doing and experiencing and a set of best practices from the literature. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The quality and content of English language courses offered in secondary schools require special attention as they affect many students who learn English as one of their school subjects. Despite curricular provisions prescribing balanced development of language competence and a number of so-called "key competences", class work in Polish uppersecondary schools heavily focuses on developing students' selected language skills and language systems, i.e. the areas that are tested during school-exit exams, neglecting civic competences (i.e. group work) and digital skills. It is suggested that technology-assisted project-based language learning can help remedy this situation. Accordingly, the aim of this article is to outline a class project that illustrates the integration of project-based learning approach in language (English) and content (Polish language and culture) learning, the execution of which necessitates collaboration in groups, as well as the use of technology. It is hoped that the presented project will provide inspiration and guidance on how to engage upper-secondary school students in meaningful project work so that the development of target competences can be facilitated.

AB  - In recent decades, higher education institutions worldwide have been moving from knowledge-based to competence-based curricula. One of the greatest challenges in this transition is the difficulty in changing the knowledge-oriented practices of teachers. This study evaluates the consistency between syllabus design and the requirements imposed by a competence-based learning environment. To make this comparison, the study sets four criteria (C1: explicit relationship between syllabus and graduate profile; C2: precision of the learning outcomes and assessment criteria; C3: contents that mobilise the learning outcomes; and C4: learning and assessment activities) derived from the literature and a thematic analysis of competence-based learning in higher education. Afterwards, a sample of 150 syllabi from different disciplines of five Chilean public universities were analysed, all of which stated the use of learning outcomes and competences in their learning models. Using a three-point Likert scale derived from the aforementioned criteria and their indicators, a comparison was made between the actual practices reflected in the syllabus design and the previously established criteria. Results show a gap between the declaration of a competency-based curriculum and actual syllabus outlines. Moreover, there are important differences among disciplines. Although all disciplines present high levels of accomplishment for Criteria 1 and 3, only the discipline of health sciences presents an acceptable level for Criteria 2 and 4. It is recommended that further research be undertaken towards identifying effective competencybased syllabus design. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - Europe has stressed the importance of lifelong learning as a way for its citizens to enrol and to engage fully in day-today demands of work and citizenship life events. Support is more urgent for those who are at risk of social and educational exclusion. This paper presents an overview on the goals of the European project LIBE “Supporting Lifelong learning with Inquiry-Based Education”, that aims at designing, developing and trying out an innovative e-learning management system devoted to develop key information processing skills for ICT with an inquiry-based approach to learning, focused on the young adult population (16-24) that have low levels of competences regarding literacy, numeracy and ICT skills. Additionally, it presents the results of a content analysis of focus groups sessions, carried out with Portuguese teachers, trainers and students, aiming to identify the key competences and skills most needed by young low achievers. The Portuguese results integrate the alignment of the proposal of the LIBE framework for the learning outcomes, instructional objectives and ICT key information processing competencies. Results highlight literacy skills and social competence as the most relevant for the target audience, adding ICT competences as very important in developing literacy skills and self-efficacy. Pedagogical support is considered a significant part of the students’ successful learning, both in face-to-face or e-learning environments. © 2016, Bielefeld University, All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of mentoring in academia as a strategy to support individual academic careers has a long tradition. It has been shown that the combination of mentoring as well as training sessions to acquire interdisciplinary key competences and networking activities is suitable for enhancing the individual's skills in various ways. In addition, it is evident that mentoring has a strong link to organisational learning as individual and institutional aims become connected and personal knowledge is transformed into collective knowledge. To date, the impacts of mentoring programs on the organisational development in universities have received little or no attention. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a new framework for developing social innovation competencies in social sciences within the agenda of the Relational University. It explores the educational strategy promoted by the Social Innovation Excubator (SIE), an experimental social sciences lab that provides students with a work-based learning scenario focusing on the solution of social problems. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper explores a new learning strategy to promote the Relational University. This exploration designs an experimental infrastructure named SIE. This infrastructure promotes the link between work-based learning and social innovation to develop four key competencies: heuristic, epistemic, relational and experimental skills. Findings: There is little attention in the literature about work-based learning and social innovation. The conceptual framework provides a program on Social Innovation Capitalization (SIC) in the framework of the SIE. This framework provides a process of four phases to prototype social innovations: exploration, experimentation, exploitation and evaluation as a process to boost social innovation skills. Research limitations/implications: The conceptual framework of Relational University is an innovative and integrative model (companies, social organizations, public sector and civil society) that develops a work-based learning strategy through SIE infrastructure. The SIE has a strong implication for social sciences developing an experimental space to explore, exploit and evaluate local social problems. Practical implications: The SIE infrastructure and the SIC program promotes a new strategy in social sciences to boost employability (new competencies), entrepreneurship (pilot social organizations) and intraentrepreneurship (social innovation in organizations). Originality/value: This paper proposes a conceptual and empirical framework to develop the Relational University through a new learning strategy linking work-based learning and social innovation. This practical framework covers a lack in the work-based learning perspective opening a new line of research linked to social innovation. © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This article investigates whether a reflexive portfolio is instrumental in determining the level of acquisition of clinical competences in traumatology, a subject in the 5th year of the degree of medicine. A total of 131 students used the portfolio during their clinical rotation of traumatology. The students’ portfolios were blind evaluated by four professors who annotated the existence (yes/no) of 23 learning outcomes. The reliability of the portfolio was moderate, according to the kappa index (0.48), but the evaluation scores between evaluators were very similar. Considering the mean percentage, 59.8% of the students obtained all the competences established and only 13 of the 23 learning outcomes (56.5%) were fulfilled by >50% of the students. Our study suggests that the portfolio may be an important tool to quantitatively analyze the acquisition of traumatology competences of medical students, thus allowing the implementa-tion of methods to improve its teaching. © 2016 Santonja-Medina et a.

AB  - In this paper the influence of bilingual education on the acquisition of the key learning to learn competence is examined. To do so, bilingual (n = 1,966) and non-bilingual students (n= 14,713) of Castilla-La Mancha enrolled in the 2nd year of Compulsory Secondary Education took a series of tests designed to assess two dimensions of the competence of learning to learn: “metacognitive strategies”, made up of two learning standards related to metacognitive processes, and “learning strategies”, a dimension consisting of five standards connected to cognitive processes. Results showed bilingualism had a significant effect on the acquisition of the key competence of learning to learn. © 2016, Universidad de Granada. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article considers the mathematical models of the growth and accumulation of scientific and applied knowledge since it is seen as the main potential and key competence of modern companies. The problem is examined on two levels - the growth and evolution of objective knowledge and knowledge evolution of a particular individual. Both processes are described mathematically by exponential and logistic laws and parameters (intensity of knowledge obsolescence and the knowledge half-life period) allowing application of the models to real practise of knowledge management. © 2016 G.

AB  - In spite of the absolute prohibition against torture in international law, this grave human rights abuse is still practiced systematically and with impunity in the majority of countries around the world. Mental health professionals can play a positive role in the fight against torture and impunity, by developing competencies to assess the psychological sequelae of torture. High-quality psychological evidence can help to substantiate allegations of torture, thereby increasing the likelihood of success in civil, administrative, and criminal proceedings. This article will orient mental health professionals to issues specific to forensic assessment of torture survivors. It provides a brief introduction to the sociopolitical context of torture, reviews literature on the psychological sequelae of torture, introduces the reader to key competencies, offers information on strategies for producing documentary evidence and expert opinion, highlights ethical considerations, and suggests areas for development in the field. © McGill University.

AB  - Competence-based education (CBE) is the leading paradigm for education reform of Vocational Education and Training in European countries. This study addresses the association of collective team identification, task interdependence, team learning, and team size, with the implementation of CBE (N = 1008 teachers, 93 teams). Information processing in teams was positively associated with the implementation of CBE. Furthermore, trends revealed that information storage and retrieval, task interdependence, and smaller team sizes were associated with less disagreement within the team about the CBE-level of the educational program. These results provide further insight into the importance of team learning for education reform. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to discuss issues related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. It is emphasized that the need to prepare students with twenty-first-century skills through STEM-related teaching is strong, especially at the elementary level. The authors present selected previous experiences, publications, research into the study topic, and review examples of primary school robotics and programming curricula, as well as associated educational activities. The authors stress that workshops, using kits to build and programme robots, are a modern form of interdisciplinary education of children and youth. Design/methodology/approach: The rationale for conducting such activities in schools is found in the European reference framework in the context of training of key competences. Classes in robotics – if properly taught – will have an impact on the development of mathematical literacy and scientific–technical information and social competences. At the same time, competence is understood to mean a combination of knowledge, skills and attitudes appropriate to the situation. Besides, an analysis is presented of basic legal regulations in this matter as well as results of a survey, conducted in Poland and Ukraine among in-service teachers and prospective teachers. Findings: The study was carried out with the participation of 91 primary school teachers and future teachers in the province of Silesia and at the University of Silesia in Poland, and in Ukraine, at Borys Grinchenko Kyiv University. The survey contained 15 questions about the pedagogical research “Robotics and children”. The study was carried out to determine the needs of modern education to introduce the basics of robotics in the educational process of primary school. Originality/value: It can be expected that the findings from the prior Polish and Ukrainian surveys can be extrapolated into curricula for secondary schools and vocational education and training (VET) in the coming years. © 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The Berge et al. article in this volume presents the functional construct of writing that underlies summative and formative assessment of writing as a key competency in Norway. A functional construct implies that specific acts of writing and their purposes constrain what is a relevant selection among the semiotic resources that writing generally affords. In this article, we present the specific criteria that are currently being introduced in Norwegian teaching and assessment of writing, as well as selected aspects of their development. The article builds on an assumption that assessment criteria have such educational importance that even their origins, intellectual trajectories and underpinnings should be given attention in educational research. In this context, the article presents elements of a rare approach, in that national ‘norms of expected proficiency’ at politically predefined educational grade levels have been grounded in sustained collaboration with experienced teachers of writing across the curriculum, and may thus be viewed as yet unofficial ‘standards’. In the first step, a combination of existing curricula and literature review of writer development was used to tentatively draft a first set of criteria for the grades included in a 2005 national test of writing (grades 4, 7, 10 and 11). In the second step, such criteria were developed through an iterative, long-term process where initial criteria were confronted with the judgements of experienced teachers. Through ‘think aloud’ assessment interviews, pairs of teachers across Norway were asked to assess specific cases of students’ writings and voice criteria for their judgements, both within and across a series of domains. In the third step, interview transcripts were used to search for criteria used by several pairs of locally situated teachers across geographically distributed schools. Criteria thus identified were pooled into a refined set of ‘national standards’ that were subsequently tested out in everyday classroom contexts. On the basis of this confrontation with educational reality, the set has been further refined to form the version presented in this article. The Norwegian case raises a range of issues related to curriculum development, ‘standards’ and educational sustainability. © 2016 British Educational Research Association.

AB  - Purpose: – The purpose of this paper is to find a framework for the assessment of the learning outcomes of entrepreneurship education as a cross-curricular subject. The problem is twofold: the first difficulty is the relationship to the general issues regarding competence and its assessment; the second difficulty is the assessment of competencies in cross-curricular education in diverse contexts such as school and work. Design/methodology/approach: – The European key competence for lifelong learning of the sense of initiative and entrepreneurship and the European qualification framework (EQF) are convenient to benchmark the outcomes of enterprise education. In order to assess and develop competence in vocational students, educators should design real life problem solving situations, which are new for the students and closely related to their vocations. Findings: – The study describes an assessment process of the learning outcomes in terms of knowledge, skills and competence. While the authors tested knowledge by giving the students open-ended questions, the authors assessed the skills and competence with a practical problem concerning the students’ vocational discipline to be solved in groups. Research limitations/implications: – The paper calls for a better alignment between work experience, teaching for competence and assessment of key competences – such as the sense of initiative and entrepreneurship – taught as a cross curricular subject. Originality/value: – The assessment makes use of a theoretically grounded definition of competence, and considers varied forms of evaluation of entrepreneurship education. Educators can use it across Europe as it refers to a common background, the European key competences and the EQF, and it promotes the students’ transitions to work and mobility. It is rigorous, and, at the same time, adaptable to the context. It is meaningful for the various stakeholders at various levels: students, employers, schools, workplaces and institutions. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - This large-scale study compares the digital skills of CLIL and non-CLIL secondary students by means of two separate tests assessing 'communicative digital competence' (CLIL group, n=2,152, and non-CLIL group, n=18,093) and 'informational digital competence' (CLIL group, n=2,581, and non-CLIL group, n=17,553). The findings indicated that CLIL students showed significantly better digital skills than non-CLIL learners, particularly regarding communicative digital competence. This may suggest CLIL students are more familiar with the use of ICT, and that the communicative skills acquired by means of CLIL methodology based on communication, participation and interaction were transferred to digital environments. These outcomes reveal a new CLIL by-product as well as added value in a highly underexplored area in CLIL research: its effectiveness in the acquisition of key competences (in this case, digital competence), which are the major goals of compulsory education. © 2018 Revista de Linguistica y Lenguas Aplicadas.

AB  - Diagnosing is one of teachers' key competences. Lately, a new model of teachers' diagnostic competence and therewith a new measurement method focusing on diagnosing students' learning behavior in an interdisciplinary approach have been developed. They can build a basis for promoting teachers' diagnostic competence. However, some questions relevant to promoting teachers' diagnostic competence concerning students' learning behavior still remain unanswered: Which values do teachers-on-the-job in contrast to preservice teachers with or without teaching experience gain through experience and which are the relevant variables that lead to a high level of diagnostic competence focused on learning behavior? Thus, this study aims at enlightening these issues. In a sample of 293 participants (93 German grammar school teachers, 107 German teacher students in their second phase of teacher education, and 93 German preservice students in their first phase of teacher education), teachers' diagnostic competence concerning learning behavior as well as teachers' motivation, attitude, self-efficacy, knowledge, and reflection on experience concerning diagnosing was measured. Motivation, attitude, and knowledge were found to be substantial positive predictors of diagnostic competence concerning learning behavior, with differentiated predictions for teachers' experience. Reflection on experience and self-efficacy unexpectedly was not found to be relevant. Teachers-on-the-job were generally better at diagnosing their students' learning behavior than were preservice teachers without teaching experience. However, the diagnostic work of preservice teachers with teaching experience was as credible as that of the in-service teachers. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.

It represents a critique as well as an extension of previous alternatives in that it views writing as a culturally and individually intentional act of semiotic mediation. Its perspective is sociocultural and functional; focussing on the relation between writing acts and their purposes, and its dynamic construction captures flexible relations between these. The communicative aspects encapsulate semiotic tools which written mediation affords. A discussion of curricular and didactic potentials finishes the article, illustrating how the model may form a basis for a varied teaching of writing, as well as being a tool for learning and assessment within and across school subjects. © 2016 British Educational Research Association.

AB  - It is imperative that schools and communities give students opportunities to participate in active citizenship and prepare them with the important skills and dispositions needed to become informed citizens. Action civics is a promising practice that puts students at the heart of civics learning by providing them with the opportunity to learn about civic and political action by engaging in a cycle of research, action, and reflection about problems they care about. As a response to move civics education toward a more action-oriented approach, the researchers planned and hosted two iterations of a summer civics institute for students entering 5th–9th grades. Using Jessica Gingold’s (2013) framework for action civics evaluation, this mixed-method research study explores the outcomes of the iEngage Summer Civics Institutes. Findings suggest that iEngage successfully incorporated four key competences from this framework, including producing 21st-century positive youth leaders, producing active and informed citizens, increasing youth civic participation, and encouraging youth civic creation. However, iEngage was not without its limitations and challenges. © College and University Faculty Assembly of National Council for the Social Studies.

AB  - The intent of this research is to assess the implementation state of entrepreneurship programme and its influence in developing entrepreneurship key competencies among undergraduate students. The survey design was employed for the research. A total population of 8,101 undergraduate students from University of Benin was used. A sample of 382 undergraduate students was used for the research. A structured questionnaire, validated by two experts was used for the data collection. The Cronbach alpha statistical method was employed to determine the reliability of the instrument, which yielded the coefficient alpha value of 0.87. Twenty items questionnaire was administered to the respondents with the help of two trained research assistants. The data were analyzed using the mean, standard deviation, and t-test statistics. The research revealed that entrepreneurship programme is not properly implemented particularly at the university level. It also revealed that students are not well-equipped with entrepreneurship key competencies such as creative and innovative skills that would have helped them in starting and running their own business. It also revealed that there was no significant difference between the mean responses of Science and Arts/Humanity-based students regarding the implementation state of entrepreneurship programme. It further revealed that there was no significant difference between the mean responses of Science and Arts/Humanity-based students regarding the extent to which entrepreneurship programme has equipped students with creative and innovative skills. Consequently, the authors drew a useful conclusion for the subject matter. Providing sufficient amount of financial resources, involving employers of labour, sourcing for qualified teaching and non-teaching personnel, procuring the state-of-the-art infrastructural facilities, as well as utilizing appropriate instructional methods, that would help in equipping students with creative and innovative skills for starting and operating their own businesses were further recommended.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop a multi-dimensional scale to measure students' awareness of key competencies for M-learning and to test its reliability and validity. The Key Competencies of Mobile Learning Scale (KCMLS) was determined via confirmatory factor analysis to have four dimensions: team collaboration, creative thinking, critical thinking and problem solving, and communication. The research subjects are 815 students from the elementary school that participate in M-learning programme in Taiwan. The research results show that students have better self-awareness in team collaboration and creative thinking, but have worse self-awareness in critical thinking and problem solving. This study also found that there was no significant difference between genders in the KCMLS, but students who study in the schools that committed in M-learning longer have higher awareness in all dimensions than students who study in the schools that committed to M-learning in fewer years. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Objective: The aim of this paper is to present the academic requirements for the education of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and to discuss some of the challenges in providing quality supervised practice and the solutions proposed by some programs in Brazil. Methods: Brazilian proposals regarding the training of SLPs are reviewed, with guidelines provided by the International Association of Logopedics and Phoniatrics (IALP) and the Comité Permanent de Liaison des Orthophonistes-Logopèdes de l'UE (CPLOL), and descriptions of the specific experience of the oldest Brazilian program are provided. Results: The bachelor's degree is the minimum level required for the independent practice of speech-language pathology and audiology in Brazil, where there are 75 undergraduate programs. In several programs, students are encouraged to enjoy the diversity at their university, enrolling in courses of different areas to broaden their experience. The basic areas of the undergraduate program are mandatory as per recommendation of the Ministry of Education and include competences related to the health system, decision making, communication, leadership and continued education. Since practice training is part of the undergraduate programs, it is incorporated into the pedagogical concept and has a major role in it. Conclusion: The structure of the programs allows the dissociation of theory from practice to be attenuated; both educational strategies are used together as part of the pedagogical concept. © 2015 S.

AB  - There is an on-going recognition of the need for facilitation to support different group settings. However, the skills and expertise required to successfully facilitate a group of participants to achieve their goal is a challenging task to achieve. There are a number of barriers towards facilitation: A facilitator needs to operate at many different levels at the same time; understand the politics within the group; encourage interaction within the group; and guide participants through tasks and activities, while balancing the needs of the group and the client to reach real outcomes. One of the key competences of a facilitator is flexibility, to adapt to varying circumstances. The complexity and dynamic nature of delivering an appropriate and effective facilitation service makes it therefore difficult to assess the facilitator's performance in any facilitated session. In this paper we describe a framework in the form of an artefact developed to aid the facilitators in assessing their own performance in different meetings. Facilitation Service Assessment Framework (FSAF) allows facilitators to define metrics and measures in the context of facilitator's goals. The assessment framework consists of a structure and a process which facilitators use to apply the framework to facilitation scenarios. Finally, the paper describes how experts evaluated FSAF in alternative scenarios by running a survey and then by conducting interviews. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - This article assesses the extent to which the impact of overeducation and overskilling on labour market outcomes such as earnings and job satisfaction relate to mismatches in particular competency areas. The analysis uses REFLEX data, which collects information about 19 key competence areas related to job performance. We find that the penalties to both forms of mismatch are insensitive to the inclusion of controls for overskilling in a wide range of jobspecific competencies. The research suggests that the problem of mismatch relates to an inability to fully utilise general or innate ability as opposed to specific areas of acquired learning. We conclude that the problem of mismatch can only be effectively addressed by raising general levels of job quality within developed labour markets. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - After one decade of Competence-Based Education (CBE), the need arises to investigate the experiences and implementation of CBE in contemporary higher education. A phenomenographic analysis using interviews was conducted with three different groups of stakeholders, namely curriculum coordinator, teachers and students at 26 different educational institutions, providing three different types of educational programmes (ICT and Media, Management, Teacher Education). Results suggest that CBE is emerging and that the majority of the institutions designed their education through a mix of traditional and competence-based teaching and assessment methods. Nevertheless, some obstacles appeared as restrictions to succeeding in the further implementation of CBE. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article analyses the growing focus on teacher competences European policy discourse against the backdrop of global convergences education reforms. It traces key ideas, policy recommendations, peer learning and documents which underscore the relevance of teacher quality for education improvement, as recently stressed the European Commission Communication and Staff Working Documents Rethinking Education. The intertwining of teacher competence frameworks with other areas of education policy is outlined - key competences school education, the quality of initial teacher education, and the continuous professional development of teachers - teasing out reasons for their central role. Some insights from research and peer learning then explore key implications the defining and implementing of teacher competence frameworks national education systems. A comparative viewpoint further analyses current policy trends about teacher competences across European national contexts, discourse and practice. order to do so, a framework of analysis takes into account system features as key variables affecting national policy - roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, governance and education cultures, and the status of the teaching profession. Across the variety of policy practices, the analysis endeavours to trace some emerging patterns and trends, highlighting paradigmatic national examples, with some food for thought. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Competence-based education refers to the integration of knowledge, skills, attitudes and interactivity as the intended outcomes of learning. It makes use of lifelong learning and lifelike tasks in realistic settings and requires the cooperation of teachers. This research was prompted by the desire to explain why collegial cooperation often seems to be problematic in schools and universities. Are there certain social structures or behavioural patterns that influence the cooperative culture in teacher communities? The research material was collected in 2013 and 2014 in Oulu, Finland. The target groups were both newly qualified and experienced vocational teachers at all educational levels (N=30). The data collection methods were open questions in interviews and questionnaires. The research approach and analysis methods were qualitative. The theoretical background is in humanistic-cognitive and experiential learning as well as in dynamic epistemic conceptions. The findings show that the prevailing model in teacher communities is individualistic, discipline-divided and course-based, especially among older teachers. The obstacles refer to teachers’ self-image and a deeply rooted fear of criticism or revelation of incompetence. The promoters of cooperation were connected to the changing practices and desire of sharing with colleagues. © 2015, University of Ljubljana. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research on the effectiveness of competence-based education (CB-education) across educational contexts and levels requires a new evaluation measurement. This study explores the face validity, construct validity, and robustness of a competency self-report instrument that is aligned with contemporary competence theory and with current educational practice based on CB-qualification frameworks. A pilot study showed face validity of the competency constructs and indicators according to students from various levels in tertiary education. The results of the principal components analyses and parallel analyses, using data from 351 secondary vocational education and academic students, show more construct validity and robustness for competency constructs that are concrete and easy to relate to specific situations (e.g., "applying expertise") compared with the abstract competencies (e.g., "deciding and initiating"). This article sets out implications for designing and administrating uniform competency self-reports across educational levels and discusses suggestions for subsequent research. © 2014 Sage Publications.

AB  - Cognitive self-regulation refers to the mental processes that students adopt with the aim of adapting and changing their processes of cognition and that can lead to positive results in terms of learning. The purpose of the present study was to develop a short scale with sound psychometric properties in order to measure self-regulated knowledge in university students. The scale was designed on the basis of the Self-Regulated Learning theoretical framework (Pintrich, 2004) as well as the results of previous studies investigating students’ cognitive self-regulation. The «Self-Regulated Knowledge Scale - University» (SRKS-U) was made up of five subscales, each one intended to measure one of the following cognitive processes: knowledge networking, knowledge extraction, knowledge practice, knowledge critique, and knowledge monitoring. The psychometric properties of the scale were tested on a sample of 2.209 Italian university students (average age = 22.6 years; SD = 6.14; 67% female) to ascertain its reliability (internal consistency) and factorial structure (using a Confirmatory Factor Analysis). A multigroup analysis was employed to verify the measurement invariance of SRKS-U across gender. The results proved the good internal consistency of the scale, confirmed its theoretical structure, and demonstrated its configural, metric and scalar invariance across gender. Given its brevity and its good psychometric properties, the SRKS-U can be usefully employed in research programs which aim to investigate self-regulated knowledge as well as in evaluation programs as a screening instrument to provide information that can be used for developing targeted interventions in order to enhance students’ self-regulation of learning. © 2015, Edizioni Universitarie di Lettere Economia Diritto.

AB  - Competence-based teaching in higher education institutions and its evaluation have become a prevalent topic especially in the European Union. However, evaluation instruments are often limited, for example to single student competencies or specific elements of the teaching process. The present paper provides a more comprehensive evaluation concept that contributes to sustainable improvement of competence-based teaching in higher education institutions. The evaluation concept considers competence research developments as well as the participatory evaluation approach. The evaluation concept consists of three stages. The first stage evaluates whether the competencies students are supposed to acquire within the curriculum (ideal situation) are well defined. The second stage evaluates the teaching process and the competencies students have actually acquired (real situation). The third stage evaluates concrete aspects of the teaching process. Additionally, an implementation strategy is introduced to support the transfer from the theoretical evaluation concept to practice. The evaluation concept and its implementation strategy are designed for internal evaluations in higher education and primarily address higher education institutions that have already developed and conducted a competence-based curriculum. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The article outlines the main problems of modern higher education in terms of international virtualization industry. The authors developed a technique of formation of information and professional competence of the economic profile, which presented its basic components, we consider a system of pedagogical conditions that affects the level of formation. The essence of the competence approaches to the preparation of information at the high school in the framework of academic mobility, it was given the theoretical and experimental study of the essence of information and professional competence and its significance depending on the scope of activities; it was developed and scientifically grounded information competence-based education technology students at the high school; criteria and indicators to measure the level of information and professional competence of specialists and effectiveness were developed in the study of the technology of formation of students of the high school. The authors believe that enhancing the innovative pedagogical training of specialists of economic profile can be achieved by allocating as an independent integrative learning objectives the formation of bachelors and masters of information and professional competence, which is manifested in all competencies related to information aspect of knowledge, information and intellectual skills and capacity for reflexive self-organization in addressing educational and professional tasks and problems through the involvement of information resources. A necessary condition to achieve this goal in an educational institution is the introduction into the educational process special information competence-oriented learning technologies. © 2015, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

AB  - An appreciative lens has been used to explore the question: what is it in the performance of managers, other employees, vocational educators and apprentices themselves, which enables an apprentice to experience a sense of thriving at work? The apprentice is understood to be involved in a process of continually developing and becoming as their social identity as a tradesperson emerges. Previous researchers have noted how learning to both ask for, and offer, help is a key competence that successful apprentices develop during their training. This helps to focus attention on the social context of the apprentice’s experience. This study suggests that when managers, vocational educators and apprentices engage in behaviours that promote affiliation they have the opportunity to develop not only more meaningful relationships but also to experience a sense of thriving at work. © 2015 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.

AB  - Video analysis, using the program Tracker (Open Source Physics), in the educational process introduces a new creative method of teaching physics and makes natural sciences more interesting for students. This way of exploring the laws of nature can amaze students because this illustrative and interactive educational software inspires them to think creatively, improves their performance and helps them in studying physics. This paper deals with increasing the key competencies in engineering by analysing real-life situation videos – physical problems – by means of video analysis and the modelling tools using the program Tracker and simulations of physical phenomena from The Physics Education Technology (PhET™) Project (VAS method of problem tasks). The statistical testing using the t-test confirmed the significance of the differences in the knowledge of the experimental and control groups, which were the result of interactive method application. © 2014 SEFI.

AB  - This paper unites two streams of enquiry: ‘managerial work’ and ‘professional services call centres’. The ‘role of the manager’ is an under researched area in call centre studies though the ‘managerial regime’ has been frequently invoked while describing the info-normative control mechanisms. Additionally, there is a paucity of discussion on professional services call centres since much of the commentaries are situated in the context of mechanistic or mass-customised service delivery models. A call centre employing professionals is distinctive in its nature. A professional workforce is required to work in an information communication technology (ICT)-dominated ecosystem where their autonomy and discretion is constrained. This paper captures the voice of the General Manager (GM) of a health contact centre (HCC) and critically examines the impact of the work organisation on the managerial role. This case study sheds light on the key competencies of the GM who is required to negotiate the duality of the work organisation–preserving the established practices of the nursing workforce and transitioning them into the efficiency-driven environment of a call centre. © 2014 AIRAANZ.

AB  - Emotional intelligence comprises of several important elements which enhance the ability of several key competencies. This study attempts to examine the relationship between emotional intelligence, communication skills and information technology skills among university students in Malaysia. Three thousand one hundred and one final year students from 10 public universities in Malaysia were randomly chosen as samples for this study. The Bar-On Emotional Quotient: Short (EQ-i:S) by Bar-On has been utilized for the purpose of measuring emotional intelligence. An inventory by Moreale, Spitzberg and Barga was used to measure communication skills while the Computer Efficacy Scale by Murphy, Coover and Owen was utilised to measure skills in information technology. Results showed that there were positive significant relationship between emotional intelligence and both communication and information technology skills. This study implicates that students with high emotional intelligence will have better command in communication skills and information technology skills. © 2015 Canadian Center of Science and Education.

AB  - Human resource management is a process of bringing people and organizations together so that the goals of each other are met. Nowadays it is not possible to show a good financial or operating report unless your personnel relations are in order. Over the years, highly skilled and knowledge based jobs are increasing while low skilled jobs are decreasing. This calls for future skill mapping through proper HRM initiatives. Indian organizations are also witnessing a change in systems, management cultures and philosophy due to the global alignment of Indian organizations. There is a need for multi skill development. Competency Mapping is a process of identifying key competencies for an organization, the jobs and functions within it. Competency mapping is important and is an essential activity. This study has developed the competency dictionary and mapped the defined competencies at Private Ltd and found the areas for training and development. © 2015 Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences.

AB  - Background The German Society of General Practice and Family Medicine (DEGAM) has defined educational seminars during post-graduate training as a core element to improve trainees’ specific knowledge and competencies. Furthermore, these seminars facilitate networking among trainees and support the process of identity formation in family medicine. Since its implementation in 2009, the Verbundweiterbildungplus Baden-Württemberg (VWBplus Ba-Wü) has offered educational seminars. Aim of this article is to analyse the content of these educational seminars and to derive implications for other family medicine training programmes in Germany. Methods From 2009 to 2015, the data from all educational seminars was descriptively analysed. Furthermore, two researchers categorised the seminar contents independently of each other and assigned them to the competence-based curriculum for family medicine training (Kompetenzbasiertes Curriculum Allgemeinmedizin, KCA). Results Until 2015, 600 trainees participated in a starter seminar of the VWBplus Ba-Wü. In total, 1,116 teaching units and 160 different seminars covered all relevant topics of the KCA. A restructuring of organisational processes and seminars was necessary to handle the increase in the number of participants, including the development of specific software for electronic support. Of all these seminars, 56% were held by specialists or trainees in family medicine. The participating trainees rated the educational seminars in general and the possibility for networking as (very) good. Conclusions The contents of the educational seminars included in family medicine training programs will have to be specifically based on family medicine and cover all relevant aspects of the KCA – medical expertise, competencies and procedures. In order to ensure a common standard concerning didactic methods and qualifications of teachers, a didactic guideline is to be developed. The increasing demand of family medicine training programmes requires (further) development of the software eSchoolab, including integration of the KCA. © 2016

AB  - Our societies have come to be known as knowledge societies in which lifelong learning is becoming increasingly important. In this context, competences have become a much discussed topic. Many documents were published by international organisations (UNESCO, World Bank, European Commission) which enumerated 21st century key competences. The field of learning theories has also experienced advances. Findings from neuroscience have promoted a new understanding of what really happens in the brain when we learn. At the same time, the fact that learning increasingly takes place in virtual communities led George Siemens (2004) to propose connectivism as a learning theory for the digital age. Similarly, Roberto Carneiro (2010) suggested a theory he called generativism which aims at describing collaborative learning with digital technologies and open educational resources. These theories might be better able to describe and explain lifelong learning than classical learning theories. In the field of digital technologies, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have recently received a great deal of attention. While Siemens suggested connectivist MOOCs (cMOOCs) as the ideal platform for connectivist learning, other forms of MOOCs were also developed. These MOOCs have spread at a breath-taking pace in the last few years, although it is far from clear to what extent they are based on principles from learning theories and really support learning. These developments will be presented and discussed with respect to their relevance for lifelong learning as an integral part of man's quest for meaning. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - AIM: This paper reports a study commissioned to address concerns that not all newly qualified nurses (NQNs) were perceived to be competent at the point of appointment to their first post. It seeks to understand how competence is interpreted in the context of selection and recruitment, and explore the different expectations and experiences of employing Trusts across the London region.; BACKGROUND: Competence is a significant topic in nursing and there is much literature around the concept, what it means and how it relates to behaviours and values with no universally accepted definition. However, there appears to be little evidence about how competence is assessed in practice in the selection and recruitment of NQNs to their first post.; METHODS: The study took a three-phase, mixed method approach including a literature review, an electronic survey to map current assessment and selection procedures, and focus groups to identify the competencies perceived essential by senior nurses.; FINDINGS: Most Trusts reported assessing core competencies, and could report how they do this with respect to literacy and numeracy. Employers could describe what they required from NQNs, and how applicants both met and did not meet expectations. Several personal attributes were considered as important as key competences, but these are not described in the KSF or NMC frameworks, and it is not clear how these are assessed in selection processes.; CONCLUSION: There appeared to be a large variation in the number and types of competence assessments being used for recruitment, with little consistency in the detail of the assessments, although broadly similar assessment exercises are used. There appears to be little evidence as to the validity of the measures being used and whether in fact they are measuring the competences that are being sought or considered most important. It would appear that practical skills are more easily assessable, but there is a lack of clarity regarding the assessment of those competences that are considered equally important but appear to be more elusive to assessment such as communication and teamwork. It is also unclear how a number of 'personal qualities' described as essential for NQNs are being assessed at recruitment. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article reports on the curriculum design of a distance learning sustainability bachelor’s degree in order to broaden the coverage and increase the quality of education for sustainable development in Mexican higher education. The goal of this case study was to describe the useful of the competence-based curriculum design to increase the actual stock of knowledge toward achieving curriculum greening. This bachelor’s degree has been designed with the primary purpose of boosting the supply of educational services in the country in order to not only meet the rights of all Mexicans citizens to obtain a higher education, but also to confront the sustainability challenges within the UNESCO key campaigns such as the Decade of Education for Sustainable Development, Education for all and the Millennium Development Goals (EAMG). Having as the organizing principle the competency-based framework, the sustainability bachelor’s degree project was carried out using the focus group research technique for collecting data. The concept of competence has played a key role in defining the outcomes of this curriculum; yet, there are a number of ongoing issues that are significant enough in order to address the challenges imposed by this decade that have not been included because it is impossible to cover all aspects of sustainable development. Hopefully, the sustainability graduate students will have the competences for being the most effective agent of change to foster sustainability in organizations. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The paper presents the concept of mother tongue in primary schools in Montenegro. The author has presented the structure of the Curriculum as well as its basic components: operational objectives, activities, events, concepts, and correlations. The author has explained the organization of the curriculum consisting of two areas: language and literature, and analyzed the fundamental distinction between the modern to the traditional curriculum. The analysis indicates some of the important assumptions that have significantly influenced the innovation of the overall program concept: a system of the key competences for lifelong learning, PISA definition of reading literacy, theory of literary reception. The program contains numerous elements that can strongly influence the promotion of mother tongue teaching, proposes a variety of teaching methods and forms of work suggesting the usage of modern strategies and teaching techniques, as well as numerous and diverse sources of knowledge which are directed towards learning outcomes that are aligned with Bloom's taxonomy for the cognitive area. © 2014, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

AB  - In higher education there is a growing demand for graduates with the competence to transform our society toward a sustainable future. Part of this competence in sustainability is anticipatory competence, the ability to engage with multiple futures, manage uncertainty and hold a worldview that the future can and should be steered toward a more just sustainable path. In order to further examine and operationalise anticipatory competence, a course "Sustainability and the Future" was developed and run in the University of Vechta, Germany, as part of an action research cycle exploring key competencies for sustainability in higher education. Reflective journaling was used to explore the competence acquisition process along with focus groups with students after the course. The analysis of this programme shows that while certain subject areas such as values, transport and population models provoke more critical reflection on the future, skills such as the ability to work with emotional aspects of the future, for instance hope, were perceived to be necessary for anticipatory competence. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - The paper introduces a new methodological perspective to the process of urban design, which reacts to the increasing interdependence of multipe scales in almost all facets of life. The production of place in the contemporary urban context calls for a new conception of space. We conceive space as the result of physical and non-physical activities and their relations across scales and over time. Based upon this understanding, we have identified five key competencies that might support the relevance and scope of urban design. Thus, urban design can neither be understood as a purely physical task nor as a purely social one. It needs to be rooted in the present but pointed towards the future. It is the combined result of a multitude of interventions into space and society. These need to consider strategically their short-, medium- and long-term impact. Only then, design can be medium for debate between decision makers, planners, institutions and the general public. © 2014, Wiese et al.; licensee Springer.

AB  - The process of digitization that is increasingly entering all aspects of our lives (personal, academic, professional and social) requires education to undergo a profound transformation, and communication and learning processes to be reformulated. Networks and the ability to access information and knowledge anytime and anywhere are enabling all spaces to become potential learning environments. To acquire the evidence we need, we must therefore investigate the real changes that are taking place as a result of digitization. This kind of research should enable us to transform educational activity in a broad sense. In this context and with these objectives in mind, the first International Forum on Education and Technology (FIET) was designed and developed. At the Forum, experts and researchers from 16 countries from around the world worked together for a period of nine months to define the future lines of action for the Education and Technology binomial. These lines of action were divided into the following four categories: institutions and learning environments, citizens, teachers, and public policy. The final category, which encompasses all the previous three, is one that needs to be investigated and innovated in order to produce changes and improvements in the education system. © by FUOC, 2015.

AB  - As information literacy is a key competence of the information society, information literacy instruction in public as well as academic libraries is crucial. Today, librarians do not only act as providers of information but also as educators of the information society's citizens. This study aims to assess the perceived quality of information literacy instruction in libraries of Canada's informational cities: Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. Therefore, librarians were interviewed by means of a questionnaire inspired by the SERVQUAL diagnostic tool. The questionnaire comprises of two parts: The first part consists of questions regarding information literacy instruction, in the second part the focus is on the seven competence areas of information literacy. Based on the difference between the librarians’ “Expectation” and “Experience” scores, gap scores for all questionnaire items were calculated and are now being presented and discussed. At the same time, results of public and academic libraries are compared to show the differences in information literacy instruction and the perceived value of the different information literacy competence areas.

AB  - Knowledge and familiarity of evidence-based practice (EBP) is a key competence to social workers entering the workforce. The literature review revealed no studies on Romanian graduates that have measured the beliefs, attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors students have about EBP in the final semester of their bachelor’s of social work (BSW) degree program. A sample of 89 students drawn from one public school in Romania completed the instrument. The questionnaire included measures of familiarity, attitudes, feasibility, and intentions for future use as well as demographic information. Overall, students are familiar with EBP steps and principles and have quite positive attitudes. However, only familiarity significantly predicts their intentions to engage in the EBP process upon graduation. Attitude does not contribute to the regression equation, meaning that these are not yet consolidated. These results indicate a need for attention to teaching EBP in BSW programs. To provide optimal care, practitioners must be able to locate, interpret, and apply current best evidence to a given social problem. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Few countries in the world have introduced media education into their curriculums. Montenegro became one of them in 2009, when “media literacy” was introduced as an optional subject for 16 and 17 year old students of Gymnasium high schools. This article presents the findings of the first and only research conducted so far on media education in Montenegro. It is a national case study which examines the potential of media education to change the school culture and accelerate education system reform towards embracing the new digital education paradigm in the future. The focus is on the results of research conducted through in-depth interviews with media literacy teachers all over the country. Despite the many challenges, all teachers identify the potential of media education to strengthen some of the key competences of the students and to improve their motivation and academic performance. They also identify potential to change positively school culture by transforming teachers into “cultural mediators” (Morcellini, 2007) and by supporting the formation of a “participative culture” (Jenkins & Kelley, 2013) in schools. This research recommends focusing education reform on spreading the media education pedagogy to the entire curriculum in order to embrace the new digital education paradigm in the future. © 2015 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).

AB  - The paper has twofold goals. The paper reviews the culture of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial competencies in Palestine. It is characterized by donor-supported and non-governmental-initiated trainings. This demands an urgent active involvement of universities in the field of entrepreneurship that is shaped in the form of Research and Development as well as offering entrepreneurship academic programs. This comes in line with the emerging trend of offering courses and programs at universities worldwide. Furthermore, the paper proposes a softcomputing-based entrepreneurial key competencies’ model (SKECM). This tool is capable of predicting/judging the overall quality of entrepreneurial competencies. SKECM is based on the three-cluster, ten key entrepreneurial competencies developed and used by Empretec. A three-stage, 14 different models have been developed and validated by hundreds of randomly generated datasets. Measures were used to validate the adequacy of these models including, the mean average percentage errors and the maximum percentage errors. The best achieved values for these measures are 0.8511 and 6.3175, respectively. However, although the preliminary findings of the proposed SKECM model are promising, more testing is still required before stating the adequacy of applying the softcomputing modeling approach in the entrepreneurship field (This is to state that there are no financial competing interests (political, personal, religious, ideological, academic, intellectual, commercial, or any other) to declare in relation to this manuscript). © 2016, Arafeh.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of creative activity and storytelling in assisting development of students' reflective ability and critical thinking.; Design/methodology/approach - Eight biomedical science students undertaking year-long work-based placements took part in this action research study. A coding scheme was designed to assess students' reflections initially and at each stage of the study. Intervention activities involved students using mood boards, images and storytelling to assist development of creative learning spaces with a thematic approach employed to analyse both personal and collective reflections. Post-intervention evaluation considered possible long-term impact on students' reflective ability.; Findings - Students' pre-intervention reports showed little reflection focusing mainly on competence demonstration and descriptive situation summaries. During the intervention workshops, all students demonstrated both identification of self as a practitioner and a critically reflective approach. However, this was not maintained long term as initial post-intervention reports tended to revert to a more descriptive style of writing suggesting longer-term support is required.; Research limitations/implications - The importance of further research into the long-term usefulness of creative collaborative learning spaces in work-based programmes is suggested.; Originality/value - This is the first study investigating the approach to supporting critical reflection during work placement in biomedical scientists. It is suggested that the current competence-based training programme provides limited opportunities for developing and embedding critical reflection. Where opportunities are provided, such as creative learning spaces, students' critical reflection was greatly enhanced. However, it appears essential that this approach is maintained throughout training as critically reflective skills developed during collaborative learning have limited transferability to subsequent reflective report writing. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a classroom assessment aimed at determining the extent to which five key sustainability competencies develop in students during an introductory transdisciplinary sustainability course. University sustainability programs intend to provide integrated education that fosters the key competencies students need to solve real-world sustainability problems. Translating sustainability competencies into effective pedagogical practice in integrated academic programs is not straightforward. This work builds on a previous study by both expanding the competencies evaluated and considering additional demographic characteristics. Design/methodology/approach – The paper summarizes previously identified key sustainability competencies and describes teaching methodologies used to foster these competencies in students. Development of competencies in students during a semester-long course is assessed using a pre-/ post-test based on two case studies. The implications of the findings for teaching practice and overall program structure are discussed. Findings – Based on the assessment methods used here, four of the five sustainability competencies evaluated in this study developed differently in students according to gender, disciplinary affiliation and age. Females improved interpersonal competence more than males. Systems thinking competence improved for students associated with the three disciplinary affiliations considered in this study: sustainability major, sustainability minor and business major. Anticipatory competence improved for sustainability and business majors only, but not for students minoring in sustainability and majoring in other disciplines. Finally, normative competence improved for younger students only. Research limitations/implications – Insights for teaching practice and overall program structure are based on assessment of one introductory transdisciplinary sustainability course. Much additional work is needed to draw strong conclusions about general teaching practices and program structure for sustainability education. This study provides a flexible and field-tested rubric for further evaluative work in other sustainability courses or degree programs. Practical implications – Universities incorporate sustainability into their undergraduate curricula in many ways, ranging from certificates to entire degree programs focused on sustainability. The results of this study suggest that educators pay attention to gender diversity, classroom teaching practices, disciplinary perspectives and student attitudes and developmental stages as they figure out how to make sustainability part of undergraduate education. This information may help create more effective sustainability courses and academic programs, which may maintain the viability of current sustainability programs and promote the institutionalization of sustainability in higher education. Originality/value – This research contributes to undergraduate sustainability education by providing insight into how sustainability education might thoughtfully be integrated into academic programs. It also offers an assessment approach for use by other sustainability educators to evaluate effectiveness of teaching practice and overall program structure based on five key sustainability competencies commonly cited in the literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Relevance of the work due to the need to resolve the contradiction between the new requirements for future professionals associated with the presence of experts formed by the ability to see, to identify and find solutions to problems that arise in their professional activity and the lack of readiness of teachers to implement the learning process of these requirements. The purpose of the article is to substantiate the thesis that the problem-based learning in a modern high school is objectively demanded as a basic foundation training. The methodological basis of the study was a systematic, competence and problem approaches. We used methods of study, analysis and synthesis of innovative experience of high school, the requirements of employers to the graduates, the latest scientific and educational literature in the field of didactics of vocational schools. The main results are that: The basic requirements for a modern model of learning in higher education; It justified the conclusion that in today's higher education Problem-based learning should be seen as a basic type of training that allows you to integrate educational opportunities and other learning technologies; revealed three major trends in the development of problem-based learning: the formation of an active problem-interactive learning technology, which is based on the interaction of at least three core technologies-the problem, and an interactive computer-based training; extension of the core of didactic teaching aids the creation of problematic situations in order to create all sorts of competencies; active development of integrative forms of realization of problem-based learning (problem-situational, problem-activity, problem-modular, task-design, problem-targeted, problem-playing, etc.). Materials may be useful to those skilled in the field of didactics of general and higher education, post-graduate students, university professors and secondary education system. © 2016 Ibragimov, Ibragimova and Bakulina.

AB  - This paper explores whether the business plan competition (BPC), as a classically causational mechanism for extracurricular entrepreneurship education, can facilitate the development of the means that underpin an effectual approach to new venture creation. In-depth, open-ended qualitative interviews were conducted with participants in a regional university-based extracurricular BPC before, immediately after and six months after the competition. The BPC was found to facilitate the means that could be used to adopt an effectual approach. The competition afforded valuable networking opportunities and collaborative contacts with regard to ‘who they know’; and it enhanced ‘what they know’ through enabling the acquisition, development and application of key competencies. Participants were able to gain and project a confident sense of ‘who they are’ in terms of their venture, changing their perception of the venture from a student project to a credible and viable business prospect. There were strong indications that these acquired means endured in the six months following participation. The implication is that education in which a business plan is dominant need not automatically impede the promotion of an effectual approach. © 2015, © 2015 SAGE Publications.

AB  - This paper aims to present the evaluation of eSchooling, an ICT system supporting competence-based education. The eSchooling team ran an experiment involving ten high schools throughout an entire school year, so as to cover all the teaching stages (from activities planning to the final students evaluations). In order to guarantee objectivity independence, external experts performed monitoring, validation evaluation of the experimental results. These experts analysed different aspects: the logs of the eSchooling system, the response of a user community, the logs of the interactive e-book system the outputs of users focus groups. The main indication derived from the analysis of the collected data is to involve entire groups of teachers of the same class, rather than isolated ones, when evaluating such kinds of educative tools. Another suggestion is to move in the direction of a tighter integration with other ICT tools such as the electronic board for recording activity, even when it is not competence-based.

AB  - A collection of articles in this issue examine the concept of mastery learning, underscoring that our journey is from a 19th-century construct for assuring skill development (i.e., completing a schedule of rotations driven by the calendar) to a 21st-century sequence of learning opportunities focused on acquiring mastery of special key competencies within clerkships or other activities. Mastery learning processes and standards have the potential to clarify learning goals and competency measurement issues in medical education. Although mastery learning methods originally focused on developing learners' competency with skillful procedures, the author of this Commentary posits that mastery learning methods may be usefully applied more extensively to broader domains of skillful practice, especially those practices that can be linked to outcomes of care. The transition to mastery-focused criteria for educational advancement is laudatory, but challenges will be encountered in the journey to mastery education. The author examines several of these potential challenges, including expansion of mastery learning approaches to effective but relational clinician advice-giving and counseling behaviors, developing criteria for choosing critical competencies that can be linked to outcomes, avoiding a excessively fragmented approach to mastery measurement, and dealing with "educational comorbidity.". © 2015 Association of American Medical Colleges.

AB  - Background: In 2005 a competency based curriculum was introduced in the Dutch postgraduate medical training programs. While the manager's role is one of the seven key competencies, there is still no formal management course in most postgraduate curricula. Based on a needs assessment we conducted, several themes were identified as important for a possible management training program. We present the results of the pilot training we performed to investigate two of these themes. Methods. The topics "knowledge of the healthcare system" and "time management" were developed from the list of suggested management training themes. Fourteen residents participated in the training and twenty-four residents served as control. The training consisted of two sessions of four hours with a homework assignment in between. 50 True/false-questions were given as pre- and post-test to both the test and control groups to assess the level of acquired knowledge among the test group as well as the impact of the intervention. We also performed a qualitative evaluation using evaluation forms and in-depth interviews. Results: All fourteen residents completed the training. Six residents in the control group were lost to follow up. The pre- and post-test showed improvement among the participating residents in comparison to the residents from the control group, but this improvement was not significant. The qualitative assessment showed that all residents evaluated the training positively and experienced it as a useful addition to their training in becoming a medical specialist. Conclusion: Our training was evaluated positively and considered to be valuable. This study supports the need for mandatory medical management training as part of the postgraduate medical curriculum. Our training could be an example of how to teach two important themes in the broad area of medical management education. © 2014 Berkenbosch et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

In this article, the author argues that, at the dawn of the third millennium, educational policies in the European Union are shifting from intergovernmentalism to integration. The European Qualifications Framework, the key competencies for lifelong education and training, and the benchmark criteria set out in two European strategies – Lisbon and Europe 2020 – attest to a real change in the field of educational policies. The author conducted interviews with officials from various European institutions, including the Commission, the Parliament and the Council, in order to compare their testimonies to the official discourse on education policies. The qualitative analysis of the interviews reveals that the principles of subsidiarity and neutrality have been called into question since the introduction of the open method of coordination. In contradiction with the legal framework and the official discourse, it would appear that, due to the growing influence of the European Union in education policy, the objective of reaching a common education policy in the Member States could become a reality in the coming decades. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning.

AB  - Focusing on so called "key competencies" or "21st century skills" urges educational organizations to redesign their psychosocial and physical learning environments. Inspired by studies indicating that considering learners' perceptions of learning environments can have a positive impact on learning and wellbeing, our study aims at developing design principles for involving learners in the learning environment design. This pilot case study analyzed 7- to 14-years old Finns' (n = 80) perceptions by using web questionnaires and design workshops. The results are in line with research indicating that Finnish learners value aspects such as safety and peacefulness, the possibilities for rest and physical activity, the presence of nature, and good social relations. They also value versatile, personally meaningful, and collaborative learning situations, including both traditional and novel tools and spaces for learning. The study offers educational administrators tools and data for redesigning learning environments. © Common Ground, Tiina Mäkelä, Marja Kankaanranta, Sacha Helfenstein, All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This research aimed to study the use of Project-based Learning using ICT (PBL using ICT) to develop learners’ five key competencies based on Thai Basic Education Curriculum 2008, which consists of 1) communication capability 2) thinking capability 3) problem solving capability 4) capability in applying life skills and 5) capability in technological application. The subjects were 212 students from 4 schools in Kanchanaburi, Chiang Mai, Mae Hong Son, and Si-Saked provinces that were enrolled in the 2010 academic year. The PBL using ICT approach was used as the research tool. The data collecting instruments were lesson plans, students’ journals, semi-structured interviews, and social networking where students’ learning artifacts and products were collected (nectecpbl.ning.com). Content analysis and triangulation methods were used to analyze the data. The results showed that students were able to perform five key competencies in communication capability, thinking capability, problem solving capability, capability in applying life skills, and capability in technological application. Moreover, the students learned the content in the learning areas of Science, Mathematics, Foreign Languages, Health and Physical Education, and Occupations and Technology. The research findings revealed that the use of PBL using ICT can help to develop students’ abilities to communicate ideas, problem solving, life skills, and abilities to use technology, as well as their learning in content of the subject area. © 2015, International Journal of Research in Education and Science.

AB  - This paper aims to develop a valid method to assess the key competencies of the exercise physiology profession acquired through work-integrated learning (WIL). In order to develop a competency-based assessment, the key professional tasks needed to be identified and the test designed so students' competency in different tasks and settings could be assessed. The objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) was adopted for this purpose. Key competencies for practice were identified by clinical academics, practicing accredited exercise physiologists (AEPs), and by a review of the exercise physiology scope of practice document. Final year exercise physiology students who had completed professional placements participated in three pilot OSCEs. Content validity was evaluated following feedback from students and staff, and test results were analyzed to confirm reliability. Key competencies were grouped within the domains of communication, clinical and procedural skills, and technical proficiency. The results indicate that the OSCE is a valid and reliable method of assessment of the key professional competencies of exercise physiology students acquired through WIL. © 2014 New Zealand Association for Cooperatives Education.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to identify the essential competencies required to promote service innovation. The paper is based on a systematic literature review of published studies on service innovation competencies, from which seventeen competencies which aided service innovation were identified. A framework was then developed in which the competencies are classified into five organisational practices: knowledge management, employee engagement and user empowerment, cooperation and collaboration, effective leadership and agility. The paper discusses the implications of the findings for the health sector and future research.

AB  - In this paper we argue for a revision of the knowledge, skills and competencies of school psychologists and specialist teachers. Evidence-based practice of psychologists and teachers, the accountability movement, and calls for improved service delivery have led to changes in the practice of both professions. The changes in technology and the growing complexity of service delivery have converged, leading to changes in the practice of testing, assessment, and evaluation in schools. This has led to calls for increased competencies of teachers. Testing, assessment and evaluation have previously been a central practice of educational psychologists but it is now expected to be a key competence of all teachers and other professionals working in schools. This inevitably changes the balance of practices of both teachers and educational psychologists in schools as roles converge, making collaboration and joint consultation best practice within a response to intervention framework. In view of the growing demands, changes and possibilities, we propose a three tier model of assessment functions that includes educational psychologists, special educators and teachers. The proposal is inclusive and offers possibilities for a more collaborative and participatory relationship between these professions in school settings and a stronger emphasis in pre-service curriculum on testing and interpretation and its utility in effective intervention. © 2016, Western Australian Institute for Educational Research Inc.

AB  - The Lancet Commission on Education of Health Professionals for the 21st Century calls for enhancing health education for the needs and challenges of the 21st century to improve health status globally. To complement the Lancet report, this article makes recommendations for including core global health competencies in the education of health care professionals and specific groups of the public who are relevant to oral health in a global context in order to tackle the burden of oral diseases. Experts from various professional backgrounds developed global oral health competencies for four target groups: Group 1 was defined as dental students, residents/trainee specialists (or equivalent), and dentists; Group 2 was community health workers, dental hygienists, and dental therapists (or the equivalent); Group 3 was health professionals such as physicians, physician assistants, nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists; and Group 4 was non-health professionals in the public arena such as parents, teachers, decision makers, key opinion leaders, and health and consumer advocates. Key competencies for members of each of the four target groups are presented in a matrix. The suggested competency matrix shows that many other health professions and groups in society have potentially crucial roles in the prevention, control, and management of oral diseases globally. Workforce models including a wider range of professionals working together as a team will be needed to tackle the burden of oral diseases in an integrated way in the broader context of non-communicable diseases. Further discussion and research should be conducted to validate or improve the competencies proposed here with regard to their relevance, appropriateness, and completeness. © American Dental Education Association

AB  - Competence-based education requires changing teacher roles probably affecting teacher-student interactions and student motivation. This study examines how students (N=1469) from competence-based and less-competence-based vocational schools perceive their teachers' interpersonal behaviour and its relation with their motivation. Results showed comparable teacher profiles in CBE and less-CBE schools, with an unexpected difference at the dimension level. Perceived teacher interpersonal behaviour moderated connections between CBE and student motivation, with greater impact in less-CBE than in CBE learning environments. Required changes in teacher roles are not yet perceived, hampering the expectations of increased motivation in competence-based education. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Today’s working life is increasingly characterized by entrepreneurial challenges. Entrepreneurial challenges start at an individual level with the identification of entrepreneurial opportunities, which is acknowledged as one of the key competencies for lifelong learning. Since the identification of entrepreneurial opportunities relies heavily on the opportunity identification competence (OIC) of individuals, understanding the meaning of OIC is relevant. Until now, OIC has been explored in the young entrepreneurship research field. However, entrepreneurship researchers until now have not fully explored OIC. According to several authors, the research on complex problem solving (CPS) in the cognitive research field might contribute to understanding OIC. In this paper, we review the link between OIC and CPS by comparing the cognitive and entrepreneurship research fields. We argue that those who excel in identifying opportunities share core characteristics with high-level complex problem-solvers. We propose to conduct empirical research in the future to investigate the relation between OIC and CPS within a work context in order to gain more insight into OIC. We believe that the cognitive research field contributes to the entrepreneurship research field and provides a deeper understanding of the initial steps of the entrepreneurial process. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The aim of this article is to present assessment procedures, instruments and assessment tasks, for use in translation teaching. First, we establish the current conception of assessment in teaching and the different types of assessment that exist, and indicate the aspects involved in assessment planning. Second, we provide a brief overview of assessment in translation teaching. Last, we propose instruments for such assessment and, taking competence-based training as a starting point, set out a number of tasks for assessing the specific competences involved in the learning process of translation. With the procedures we describe, great importance can be attributed to formative assessment, and assessment can be regarded as a tool that aids learning rather than as a mere grading system. The procedures in question also highlight that assessment in translation teaching should not consist solely of appraising a translation, but rather of performing a variety of tasks to assess the process and not just its end product. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Traditional folk culture forms a significant area for possibilities of creating positive values towards adherence of cultural heritage. A threat of globalisation, development of a consumer society and devaluation of spiritual and cultural values within our society requires original and effective solutions even within the process of primary education. There is no possibility to form and reinforce national awareness of pupils and develop their key competences without any knowledge of a region with is diversity and in a wide spectrum of typical phenomena, without any knowledge of history of the region and its cultural traditions. That is why the education of traditional values of folk culture becomes a part of educational processes. In our paper we mention partial results of the research aimed at implementation of elements of folk culture into processes of education in the primary education in Slovakia. The results showed that religious primary schools implement the elements of folk culture of local region more frequently.

AB  - A considerable number of young Europeans live or risk ending up in socially vulnerable situations. Different social channels (e.g., education, on the job training, leisure) exist through which youths can enhance their chances to improve their social position. There is a growing belief that sports in particular can help personal and social development of socially vulnerable youths. Nevertheless, there is little understanding of the mechanisms through which sports can foster development. In addition to participating in sports, volunteering in sports is also regarded as providing developmental opportunities for socially vulnerable youths. Today, however, there is an underrepresentation of socially vulnerable youths in volunteering and volunteer training programs. A case study in Brussels was set up within a volunteer soccer training program focused on socially vulnerable youths. A qualitative research design was used to analyze developmental experiences of participants (n = 11) and program organizers (n = 3). The study also aimed to gain more insight into the mechanisms underlying the program. Participating youths indicated development in both technical and key competences. It is concluded that a systematic approach of the volunteer training program can play an important role in the development of competences of socially vulnerable youths both as a volunteer and an individual. © 2015 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).

AB  - Background: Over the past decade, addiction medicine training curricula have been developed to prepare physicians to work with substance use disorder patients. This review paper aimed at (1) summarizing scientific publications that outline the content of addiction medicine curricula and (2) evaluating the evidence for efficacy for training in addiction medicine. Methods: We carried out a literature search on articles about addiction medicine training initiatives across the world, using PubMed, PsychINFO and EMBASE with the following search terms 'substance abuse, addiction medicine, education and training.' Results: We found 29 articles on addiction medicine curricula at various academic levels. Nine studies reported on the need for addiction medicine training, 9 described addiction medicine curricula at various academic levels, and 11 described efficacy on addiction medicine curricula. Conclusions: Several key competences in addiction medicine were identified. Efficacy studies show that even short addiction medicine training programs can be effective in improving knowledge, skills and attitudes related to addiction medicine. A more uniform approach to addiction medicine training in terms of content and accreditation is discussed. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - One of the key changes of the European Higher Education Area is the implementation of a competence-based educational system. Students are now more than ever the axis around which the university system orbits. The competences that students should acquire during their studies include transversal competences, which are those competences related to leadership skills, problem solving, and teamwork, highly valued by labor market. This is particularly important in engineering, as these skills can influence the selection of one candidate over another. So, the evaluation and teaching of these kinds of competences are now some of the main challenges facing university professors as the corresponding learning objectives need to be set and assessed, both for study programs as well as for each individual subject, and this process is new for teachers. Focusing precisely on this aspect, our work, based on an empirical study conducted with a sample of 102 engineering students from the University Center of Merida, uses a tool to measure the progress of such students in different transversal competences. This tool not only allows us to evaluate the level of competence development, but also allows us to detect students’ areas of weakness in cross-curricular training that can then be addressed. © 2015, FACTEACHEREDUCATION.

AB  - The competence approach to learning and teaching has been described by several theoretical models. These formal models are often not integrated with concrete educational activity. On the contrary, this article proposes a practical implementation of the competence approach in education. The model of reference is the Comprehensive Competence-based Education framework, defined for the vocational education and used to analyse the curriculum of some vocational schools in the Netherlands. The framework is here applied to Digital Competence. This specific vocational domain represents the field where the applicability of framework has been tested. Moreover, this is used as a starting point for the operationalisation of an educational model for the digital competence.

AB  - The learning discourse of the 21st century is characterized by the emergence of the knowledge economy, and the need for lifelong learning for learners to be able to adapt to the fast and ever changing economies of the society. This has created changing demands for the skill sets of the 21st century learners, such as the ability for critical and creative thinking, the ability for self-directed and collaborative learning, the ability to learn formally and informally, and the ability for both competition and cooperation, etc. The skill sets diverge from the almost single-faceted traditional emphasis on academic abilities, and the knowledge functions of the university is gradually changing. Knowledge creation is being regarded as possible not only by basic and discovery research, but also possible in the process of teaching, clinical practice and multi-disciplinary integration. Knowledge ownership is changing from the ivory tower research professors to combined expectations and ownership of the learners and stakeholders. The significance of knowledge is shifting from its simple significance in terms of discovery to being measured by its utilization and mobilization, and user's satisfaction. All these have implications for learning, and university teaching is also changing from traditional research based learning modes towards practice and internship, the opportunity for experiential learning, and the opportunity of exchange among an increasingly diversified student body, developed through the agenda of internationalization. The purpose of this paper is to examine these changes and how the changes require our adjustment in our teaching and learning approaches, measurement, and expectations for learning outcomes in university education. © 2014 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

AB  - The article considers the possibilities of a competence-building approach while training translation. The translator’s competences emphasized by the researchers were analyzed and the grounds for their systemizing were offered. The conducted analysis permitted to distinguish the following key competences of the translator: intercultural, special, social and personal ones. The authors have established that operational and cognitive skills are obtained and formed in the process of training and perfected in the further translation activity while experience and social skills, physiological and emotional resources are manifested and perfected only in the process of a professional activity. The formation of translator’s key competences takes place at all the stages of this complicated activity when fulfilling certain actions by the translator as a member of a definite professional team acting in a certain professional environment. Moreover, the pragmatic approach permitted to distinguish the main stages of training corresponding to the translator’s stages of activity. The practical value of the research is that the systemizing of the translator’s competences will permit to arrange their nomenclature and to elaborate the unique requirements for their formation. © 2016 Gavrilenko.

AB  - The present day level of the society informatization makes high demands on the level of information competence of specialists in all spheres, and one of the basic abilities lying in the basis of any professional activity is the ability to work with the text material. Today a specialist has to process great volumes of professional information. When working with special literature: scientific, technical, economic, juridical and other, a specialist is not only to quickly and correctly orient himself in the content but to possess the art of the information text processing. The aim of the text information processing is extracting useful and valuable information concerning a concrete problem, interpreting the content into more or less detailed form, depending on the practical value of information and its further use needs. One of the key competences that are formed in practical classes at language departments when working with texts is a communicative competence supposing student’s ability to interact with a text, to perceive information and to interpret it adequately, to develop an own statement. The problems arising in forming this competence are connected with the gap between the acquiring of theoretical base and forming of practical abilities and skills. Thus, the novelty of the study consists in the fact that there was undertaken an attempt to develop a methodology of working with a text in practical classes; it is necessary to teach working with information in the texts: to form a competence that supposes the ability to extract information, to analyze, to transform it, to use for solving problems. © Canadian Center of Science and Education.

AB  - The purpose of this research study was to identify the multimedia competencies of an educational technologist by creating a valid and reliable survey instrument to administer to educational technology professionals. The educational technology multimedia competency survey developed through this research is based on a conceptual framework that emphasizes the current definition of the field. Following the conceptual framework, a review of literature and an emergent theme analysis on 205 job announcements in educational technology were conducted. Eighty-five multimedia competencies were derived from this analysis and organized into knowledge, skill, and ability statements. These data were examined using descriptive statistics, internal consistency reliability, exploratory factor analysis, and multivariate analysis of variance. Though the purpose of the instrument was to measure multimedia competencies relevant to the field of educational technology, other constructs on the instrument emerged as more important in the analysis. The results include key competencies, such as knowledge of methods and theories of instruction; soft skills; and the ability to work in a team-oriented environment. A discussion about the results is provided. The instrument was found to have a valid and internally consistent structure. © 2013 Association for Educational Communications and Technology.

AB  - Twenty-first century learners face a multi-literacy landscape as they strive to acquire the cognitive skills needed for independent learning, apply linguistic skills to other knowledge base, and become computer literate. This article envisions a combination of skill sets and knowledge bases as the foundation of a literary competence-based curriculum. Such a curriculum would have the goal of enhancing young learners' critical thinking abilities; this would also help them take charge of the cognitive, linguistic, and sociocultural dimensions of written and spoken language in order to make learning transferable and applicable to the real world. ©, Copyright Taylor & Francis.

AB  - There is a growing demand to enhance entrepreneurship. This study aims at producing knowledge that can assist teachers in designing and supporting collaborative learning of entrepreneurship in vocational education. A qualitative case study approach was adopted. The outcome of this study provides a better understanding of the factors that hinder and enable collaboration, as related to entrepreneurship education in initial vocational education and training. In practice, nine dimensions of descriptive factors that hindered the exercise and nine distinct descriptive factors that acted as enablers were identified. This study suggests that, although the script of the learning task creates the setting for collaborative learning, the positive style of working together seals the successfulness of the exercise. Moreover, designing the complexity of the computer-supported collaborative learning task seems to be a challenging process that balances between being simple enough and yet offering sufficient complexity. Finally, the findings illuminate the teacher’s support as a valuable part of the collaborative learning process. © 2015 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.

AB  - Laboratory work is conventionally addressed to the demonstration of theoretical principles. Traditionally, students pass through several experimental setups and perform a set of tasks following the provided laboratory hand-out. With this procedure, student-oriented approaches, as well as transversal key competences, are poorly developed. To adapt practical subjects of the Chemical Engineering undergraduate degree of the University of Barcelona (Spain) to the European Higher Education Area, teaching-learning methodologies have been progressively revamped during the three academic courses (2009-2012). The main changes were mainly applied on the use of continuous formative assessment methodologies, to increase feedback, to promote collaborative learning and to engage students in ethical commitment. In accordance with the analysis of subject evaluation inquiries and academic marks obtained by students, it can be considered that the teaching-learning process in laboratory subjects has been improved especially in the acquisition/development of transferrable competences as teamwork, professional ethics, oral and written communication, and personal autonomy and self-regulation, which are necessary for personal fulfillment and employability of the chemical engineer in a knowledge-based society. © 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Since 2006, the ability to use information and communication technology (ICT) has been included as a key competence in the curriculum in Norway, and specific competence aims are developed for most grades. The aim of this study was to identify students' ability to use ICT according to the competence aims, and to examine factors that can predict students' digital competence. A sample of 1793 students and 125 school leaders from 125 schools was used. The findings show variation in digital competence both between students and between schools. Results from a multilevel analysis showed that higher levels of mastery orientation and self-efficacy (i.e., motivation) and the students' family background (i.e., language integration and the number of books at home) were predictors of students' levels of digital competence. Additionally, when school leaders reported higher levels of culture for professional development among the teachers at school, increased levels of digital competence were found among students. Challenges for schools and teachers to support students' motivation and to emphasize digital inclusion still prevail. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - In the article, the authors concentrated their attention on the professional development of the key competencies of preschool education students. In the theoretical part, they defined the professional development and key competencies necessary for future preschool teachers. The authors also described the Erasmus intensive programme as a part of the pedagogical practice with the characteristic of offering students active collaboration and an insight into their future profession. In the empirical part, they investigated the professional development of students' key competencies on the example of the Erasmus intensive programme. They analysed the reasons for a student s inclusion into the programme and their point of view on the knowledge and skills gained throughout the programme. 47 students from Slovenia, Croatia and Italy filled in the questionnaires. The results showed that students became involved in the programme for different reasons and perceived the gained knowledge and competencies differently.

AB  - This paper reports on rating during the development of a Norwegian sample-based national assessment of L1 writing as a key competency. This assessment is to be officially introduced in August 2014. Novice members of a national rater panel to assess Year 8 pupils' texts were studied during three of their successive training sessions: in June 2011, November 2011 and April 2012. My purpose was to conduct an exploratory investigation into how the rating practice of novice raters might develop during such a preparatory stage. The raters in this study mainly assessed in pairs, and data sources were assessment dialogues. The analysis of transcripts showed that rater behaviour changed only to a minor extent towards an increased use of shared assessment resources. The quality of the assessment dialogues did not change much either, leaving the impression that raters often reached consensus without much discussion. Since reliable scoring is a collective task, however, it is argued that a more balanced use of resources, both those attained from teacher practice and those attained from being a member of a national panel, may together with more exploration-oriented dialogue be necessary to achieve sufficient reliability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose – In Germany, principals’ working environments are data-rich for school improvement purposes in a rather low-stakes test-regime. An effective use of externally as well as internally generated data, also known as data wise leadership, is considered to be a key competence of successful principals. The purpose of this paper is to describe data use practices in German schools, especially focussing on schools facing challenging circumstances. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws on findings from two projects funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. A standardized questionnaire study was conducted to measure the usage of available data for school improvement quantitatively. The perceived usefulness, the reflection upon, and the use of information sources by principals were measured. Moreover, semi-structured interviews with school leaders fromschools in deprived areas were conducted, transcribed and analyzed by means of qualitative content analysis. Findings – The results showed that internal sources of information were used frequently while (international) student assessment, statewide comparative tests, and school inspections proved to be of relatively little use for the principals’ professional practice. Moreover, there was a discrepancy between the perceived usefulness of information sources and the actual use of the data. Originality/value – In contrast to the USA, for example, research on educational leadership and principals’ data use – particularly at schools in challenging circumstances – is rather limited in Germany. This paper seeks to take up this desideratum. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The relevance of this problem is related to an insufficient degree of the development of the issue of identifying the evaluation function of the competence-based training of students. The research objective: to identify and systematize, on the basis of the functional analysis of the knowledge-resource capacity of the teacher’s professional polyfunctional activity, the priority components that can be considered as indicators of quality and effectiveness of the competency-based training. The leading technologies to the study of this problem are the technologies of mastering the types of speech activity with adequate speech design, aspect-integrated learning, self-activation, personality-oriented communication, etc. In the article there are reflected the results of this work, during which students mastered the characteristics of the professional communication as important indicators of the quality level of the professional communicative competency. The article contents can be useful for practical professional activity of teachers of higher education institutions and high school teachers. © Wydawnictwo Adam Marszałek Toruń 2015.

AB  - This article explores the perspective that well-being and creativity can be nurtured in children through understanding and addressing the diverse ways in which children learn, communicate, and develop (inner diversity). In particular, our working hypothesis is that focusing children’s and young people’s learning towards the realization of their well-being supports and enables creativity. But it also requires, firstly, addressing how children perceive, engage with, and express creativity in different ways and, secondly, nurturing the development of core capacities to, in turn, underpin their capacity to develop key competences and skills in formal and non-formal learning settings. In recommending that education systems take the well-being of children as their central purpose, we are suggesting that there are capacities, ranging from personal qualities to behavioural skills, which are necessary for the development of the personal resources to enable lifelong and life-wide learning. © 2014 University of Cambridge, Faculty of Education.

AB  - In surveying past negotiation literature, successful negotiators were often portrayed as calculating and factual with a stress on keeping a poker face throughout negotiations. This article summarizes key features in the literature on emotional intelligence (EI), refutes the notion that the suppression of emotion in negotiation is desirable, and recognizes the value that EI can contribute to the repertoire of effective negotiators. The article describes key competencies associated with EI and how these skills help negotiators work with conflict if it emerges, develop creative options for potential agreements, facilitate trust, and contribute to affective and substantive satisfaction. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the Association for Conflict Resolution.

AB  - The most important component of social and economic development of the country is knowledge and information requiring mastery of higher education. The new paradigm of higher education is not training only to obtain specific knowledge but to learn to adapt to a qualitatively different conditions of life, to work in an ever-changing socio-economic environment. Successful career of the young specialist after graduation and application of acquired knowledge and skills in practice depend on the formation of key competencies in an educational institution. Nowadays Russian society demands specific results of vocational education meaning not only graduates’ professional knowledge but his practical readiness for activities in standard and non-standard situations of professional life. The article is devoted to special educational outcomes of vocational education in which knowledge is a necessary but not sufficient condition for achieving the required quality. It deals with the professional competence and its components such as vocational and key (basic) competences. The article describes the features of pedagogical stimulation of university students’ social competence development by means of interdisciplinary integration. It defines the concept “social competence” and describes pedagogical conditions for stimulation of university students’ social competence development. The study puts forward the indicators of social competence formation and presents the results of experimental work on university students’ social competence development. © 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education.

AB  - This study stems from the increasing importance of key competences, and especially of information literacy, in secondary education. This research aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a specific training program on information literacy for future secondary school teachers. A pre-experimental design with minimal control and pretest-posttest was devised through an ad hoc instrument, which evaluated the subjects’ actual level of information literacy. The study was carried out with a representative sample of future secondary education teachers from Castile and Leon, who were undertaking the Master’s degree in Secondary Education Teacher Training. In the hypothesis testing, the results of the calculation of the effect size show that the training program, which was delivered online, was very effective in teaching conceptual (or knowledge-related) contents (g>1.15), moderately effective in teaching skill-related contents (1.15>g>0.5) and ineffective in teaching attitudes (g<0.5). The graphic analysis also shows that the learning patterns are different for each component according to the initial level reached in the pretest. The study concludes by confirming the effectiveness of the program, noting the importance of explicit teacher training on key competences, specifically in information literacy competences, and by analyzing the relevance of this type of training for the integration of key competences in the teaching-learning processes implemented in the different school subjects. Finally, the paper proposes a future study on the impact of information literacy teacher training on the students’ achievement, taking into consideration the limitation of splitting the competence into its constituent parts to evaluate it, disregarding its holistic nature. © 2015, Ministry Education and Science.

AB  - This article begins by making the case that the New Zealand curriculum component known as the Nature of Science (NOS) has generally not, thus far, achieved its stated intent of helping students think differently about science and its relevance to their lives. We argue that NOS components in curricula have tended to become positioned as additional content to be learned, at least partly as a consequence of well-meaning curriculum support initiatives that aim to build teachers' own NOS knowledge. The result is that NOS is added to an already overburdened curriculum, potentially making science even more abstract and inaccessible for some students than it already is. Having outlined the nature of the problem, we then describe a recent initiative that endeavoured to address the NOS challenge in a different way. We began by asking how a NOS focus might contribute to changes in teaching and learning that more deliberately focus on supporting students to build their science capabilities so that they can become the informed citizens that The New Zealand Curriculum (NZC) identifies as the overarching goal for science learning. This curriculum initiative introduces science capabilities as a set of ideas for teachers to think with. The capabilities were derived from the intersection of the generic key competencies in NZC, the NOS strand from the science learning area, and the NZC purpose statement for learning science, which emphasises citizenship. However, as we outline in the final section of the article, it is proving very hard to expand views of learning as content acquisition to include the participatory sensibility that the addition of capabilities implies. The idea of capabilities makes intuitive sense to teachers but using them as classroom prompts to think more deeply about NOS with their students is still a work in progress. © 2015, New Zealand Council for Educational Research.

AB  - Today one of the major issues of the Russian higher education is the efficient implementation of the competency-based approach. This study considers the concept of personalization of the competency-centered training of students of the artistic-pedagogical specialization. The peculiar feature of the education personalization consists in the fact that the student's personality is not only the main objective and value but also the subject of the education. In this study, the principles of personalization of the competency-centered training of students of the artistic-pedagogical specialization are presented: conceptual dimension, fundamental nature and generality, openness, problematicity, alternativity and variability. The essence of the special theoretical-art competence as one of the key competencies of bachelors in the artistic-pedagogical specialization representing the graduate's readiness for the study, analysis and interpretation of art works, samples and phenomena of the artistic culture, the ability to use the systematized artistic-historical and artistic-theoretical knowledge for solution of the professional tasks has been revealed. The necessity of diagnostics of development of the special theoretical-art competence determined the design of the diagnostic tools as the result of which the criteria (cognitive, pragmatic, motivation-value), levels (high, intermediate, acceptable, low) and descriptors of the levels of development of such competence have been elaborated. During the process of study of the matter the following methods were used: induction and deduction of results of the psychological-pedagogical research, observation, questioning, testing, expert evaluation method and pedagogical experiment. The results of the experimental-research work have been presented that confirm the efficiency of implementation of the principles of personalization of the content of competency-based education of students of the artistic-pedagogical specialization. © Medwell Journals, 2015.

AB  - This article describes how research, practice, and education were integrated in a National Institutes of Mental Health-funded clinical trial for treating depression in nursing homes. Involving undergraduate and doctoral students in this clinical trial supported the development of key competencies, expanded the professional pipeline, and provided an avenue for disseminating the treatment to other settings. The clinical trial served as a teaching laboratory for sixteen undergraduate and six doctoral students to (1) observe the culture of older adults in nursing homes, (2) develop and adapt clinical skills to a challenging patient population, (3) refine skills for collaborating in multidisciplinary teams, and (4) appreciate the relationship between science and practice. Dissemination of the intervention to nonresearch settings was served when the students took their skills to the settings where they launched their careers. Involvement of trainees in clinical trial research expands and enriches the capacity of the health care workforce in evidence-based practice and practice-informed research.

AB  - Earlier research argues that educational programmes based on social cognitive theory are successful in improving students' self-efficacy. Focussing on some formative assessment characteristics, this qualitative research intends to study in-depth how student teachers' assessment experiences contribute to their self-efficacy. We interviewed 15s year student teachers enrolled in a competence based teacher educational programme. Thematic content analysis results reveal that the assessment characteristics 'authenticity' and 'feedback' exert a positive influence on student teachers self-efficacy during all phases of the portfolio competence assessment. The results provide a fine-grained view of several types of self-efficacy information connected with these assessment phases. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: The human resources for health crisis has highlighted the need for high-level public health education to add specific capacities to the workforce. Recently, it was questioned whether Master of Public Health (MPH) training prepared graduates with competencies relevant to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aims to examine the influence of the MPH programs geared towards LMICs offered in Vietnam, China, South Africa, Mexico, Sudan, and the Netherlands on graduates' careers, application of acquired competencies, performance at the workplace, and their professional contribution to society.Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was sent to graduates from six MPH programs. Frequency distributions of the answers were calculated, and a bivariate analysis and logistic regression of certain variables was performed.Results: The response rate was 37.5%. Graduates reported change in leadership (69%), in technical position (69%), acquiring new responsibilities (80%), and increased remuneration (63%); they asserted that MPH programs contributed significantly to this. Graduates' attribution of their application of 7 key competencies 'substantially to the MPH program' ranged from 33% to 48%. Of the 26 impact variables, graduates attributed the effect they had on their workplace substantially to the MPH program; the highest rated variable ranged from 31% to 73% and the lowest ranged from 9% to 43%. Of the 10 impact variables on society, graduates attributed the effect they had on society substantially to the MPH program; for the highest rated variable (13% to 71%); for the lowest rated variable (4% to 42%). Candidates' attribution of their application of acquired competencies as well as their impact at the workplace varied significantly according to institution of study and educational background.Conclusions: This study concludes that these MPH programs contribute to improving graduates' careers and to building leadership in public health. The MPH programs contribute to graduates' application of competencies. MPH programs contribute substantially towards impact variables on the workplace, such as development of research proposals and reporting on population health needs, and less substantially to their impact on society, such as contributing equitable access to quality services. Differences reported between MPH programs merit further study. The results can be used for curriculum reform. © 2014 Zwanikken et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Based on the results of our research we will introduce synthesized and identified fundamental structures and on their basis we will present research questions/hypotheses. We are not neglecting the recommendation for practice. We present recommendations for the development of these key competences through ideas such as “pre-departure intercultural training”, which would help students to find their way around their new environment and gain a deeper understanding of the cultural context. © 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education.

AB  - As we analyse the results of various examinations and competence tests in mathematics, we can say that students have insufficient level of certain mathematical competences. In order to solve this problem, a search to find possibilities to improve the process of teaching mathematics by means of information and communication technologies was started. A system for implementation of individual mathematics learning (Mathematics with Moodle) was prepared; it consists in gradual improvement of the level of mathematical competences of the students. A didactic tool was proposed - e-learning course preparing the students for the graduation exam in mathematics which includes an author's MatLearn module, shaping mathematical competences of students. Its aim is to increase the level of competences, especially the ones which have not been mastered yet. Programmed learning principles were used to construct study activities in the course.

AB  - This paper investigates the state of women and men’s competencies in managerial positions in four Asian countries. A large-scale quantitative investigation of firms in China, India, Korea, and Japan yielded insight into comparable proficiency ratings and the ability of men and women to drive business results. Existing management competency literature is often limited to western males and females on executive levels overlooking the Asian characteristics of female and male managers in middle- and lower-management positions. Gender differences in terms of competency strengths, actual use, and actual impact of the use of the competencies on a specific target achievement criterion in various management positions are explored. Findings reveal that in all competencies men outscore women or women display equal strength compared to their male counterparts. Findings suggest that strategic innovative orientation and change management play an important role in all of the settings that were investigated. We propose that women who want to improve key competencies needed for advancement should target those competencies in which no gender differences currently exist. On the firm level, we conclude that adopting gendered competency decision-making criteria for recruiting, staffing, and promoting, could contribute to the creation of environments in which the mix of women’s and men’s competencies can benefit both individuals and the firm. © Common Ground, Johanna Anzengruber, Herbert Nold, All Rights Reserved

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present the fundamental aspects of competence-based translator training. It begins with an overview of research on Translation Competence (TC) and its acquisition (ATC), with particular emphasis on the PACTE group's TC and ATC models, which have been validated through experimental research. It subsequently deals with four cornerstones of competence-based translator training, namely the pedagogical approach called competence-based training; specific competences in translator training; the translation task and project-based approach as a methodological and curriculum design framework; and competence assessment in translator training. The paper provides examples of how to design translator training curriculums that centre on competence development and establishes assessment guidelines.

AB  - This paper addresses digital diversity among upper secondary students. Since 2006 digital skills and competence has been embedded as key competence in the Norwegian national curriculum. A sample of 593 Norwegian students from 43 upper secondary schools participated in a survey with a digital competence quiz and a self-report questionnaire. Analysis showed differences in students' digital competence and indication of digital diversity on both student and school level. A multilevel analysis reveals that cultural capital, language integration at home, self-efficacy, strategic use of information and average grades of the students predict 20% of the variation in students' digital competence score and 49% of the variation between schools' average digital competence score. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The relevance of this study is determined by the needs of modern society for qualified specialists, which leads to the necessity of improving the system of higher education. This dictates the need for a high-quality preparation of the teacher of English who is able to act as an active subject of the professional activity and who has high levels of communicative competence.; A future teacher of English must be fluent in a foreign language and must demonstrate high foreign language communicative competence. However, not all the students of language faculties and specializations reach this level. Thus, there arises the question about a search for new approaches, methods and means of formation of foreign language communicative competence of future teachers of English at the University.; At the same time, the student’s foreign language communicative competence is an integrative personal quality, it is a tone which mediates along with other kinds of personal and professional development competence and defines its effectiveness in greater or lesser degree.; Interactive learning within the English language teaching provides a full communication between the students and the formation of skills of solving communicative tasks. The communicative competence defined as a significant component of the key competencies and the result of modern education includes linguistic, discourse, sociolinguistic and sociocultural competences as well as socio-personal interactive component correlated with cooperation and tolerance of the student. © Canadian Center of Science and Education.

AB  - In Spain the syllabus of primary education students and their future teachers is broken down by competences. As teacher educators we were interested in finding out which teaching competences teachers consider are most necessary to facilitate learning of student key competences. Therefore, we conducted a study with a sample of 286 in-service primary education teachers, using a questionnaire specifically prepared for this purpose. A descriptive and factorial statistical analysis of the resulting data was then performed. The results show that teachers place the highest value on the educational capability to promote student motivation, effort and responsibility in the development of key competences. Also they consider the competence to teach a foreign language as the least necessary. A cross-functional approach, running parallel to the integrating nature of key competences in the school curriculum, was not identified for teaching competences. Finally, certain implications are presented derived from the study. © 2016 Teacher Development.

AB  - This article reports on research that investigated how students' critical thinking skills can be developed through images. The research was located in New Zealand, a country whose national curriculum and assessment systems stress 'thinking' as a key competency and place emphasis on developing visual literacies. The research was underpinned by a critique of the impact of images on students living in an image-saturated world and the importance of them being visually literate. It involved examination and documentation of strategies used by two teachers to foster the critical thinking of year 13 students in visual arts education and their responses to those experiences. The research was positioned within an a/r/tographical framework, a method which links art, research and teaching, and privileges both text and image. The findings, presented as an integration of participant and researcher 'voice' and the 'visual', illustrate the profound effects of critical looking practice through an enquiry framework. © 2014 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - Abstract: Shame, shame management and reintegrative shaming feature in some restorative justice literature, and may have implications for schools. Restorative justice in schools is effective when perpetrators of wrong-doing can accept and take ownership of their wrongful acts, are appropriately remorseful, and seek to make amends. Shame may be understood as an ethical matter if it is regarded to arise because of the contradiction between the wrongful act and the individual’s sense of self and self-worth. Shame management (that is, seeking reintegrative over stigmatising shaming) can be regarded to reflect a form of social responsibility as it contributes to community restoration by repairing ruptured social relationships. The notion of shaming and acknowledgement of harm thus assumes norms of acceptable community behaviour, attitudes and relationships, and is therefore also an ethical matter. Successful restorative practices in schools depend on the school-wide existence and practice of such norms, and mesh with virtues education, stimulated by the contemporary demand of many national curricula to promote so-called key competencies. Although the concepts of restorative justice and reintegrative shaming serve as a context for this article, its chief impetus was provided by an evaluative study of a group of New Zealand schools, in the course of which notions such as shame, reintegration and exclusion became evident. The chief purpose of this article is to consider and problematise shame from the perspective of the philosophy of education, and ask whether the concept of shame has a place in schools, whose important aims ought to include the development of democratic citizenship. © 2014 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia.

AB  - For too long, the quality of teaching and learning in universities has been undervalued in comparison to research. Current social, economic, ecological and other challenges require that more attention be given to measures to improve the situation. Academic staff should receive incentives, policy support and high-quality pedagogical training to develop key competencies for excellence in teaching. Examples of key competencies in this area in different countries are presented as well as some schemes of policy support and pedagogical training. The case study from the University of Ljubljana is based on experiences gathered from four groups of participants during a course on Improving University Teaching in 2013 and 2014. They gave their opinion on the relative importance of different competencies in teaching, to what extent have they developed them during the course and, finally, which activities and methods used have most contributed to their development. At the end, some measures to foster excellence in teaching at the level of policy are proposed, as well as areas for further research. © 2015, University of Ljubljana. All rights reserved.

AB  - Serious games (SG) are innovative tools that are widely recognized as having considerable potential to foster and support active learning. This article addresses the question of whether and how SG can contribute to the development of the so-called "21st century skills" in education. This article starts by characterizing the current need for 21st century skills and the identification of these core skills. Thereafter, it reports on a literature review of studies analyzing SG impact on the development of one or more 21st century skills; and finally, it analyzes which, among the most relevant game characteristics, are those that could facilitate 21st century skills development. This study offers a multifold perspective on the use of SG to support 21st century skills development that may be helpful for both teachers and SG designers. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - Since 2001, Slovenian vocational education has undergone major changes at the curricular and financing levels, particularly moving towards competence-based and open curricula and the decentralisation of responsibilities. Both tendencies have changed the role of the teacher, who has become a team worker with many new responsibilities in planning, assessment and evaluation of the pedagogical process. Reform measures are regularly evaluated, and research findings are an important source of information for reforms. In our secondary analysis of selected evaluations, we attempt to prove our thesis that the teacher's autonomy has, despite this decentralisation, not increased in terms of better conditions for the students' development. Instead, it has resulted in teachers becoming exhausted by paperwork, the purpose of which they do not realise due to poor training and difficult working conditions. The article proves that the potential positive outcomes of the reforms can be lost if reform instruments are abused for political and/or economic purposes, if the swiftness and content of the reforms are dictated by the European (financial) policies and particularistic political interests, and/or if the school is reformed according to the rules of the market. © The author(s).

AB  - The present study examines the professional development problems of a high school teacher. High school teacher is both a scientist and a teacher. Teaching and research activities are integrated by his methodical activity. Methodical competency of a teacher is defined as a basis in the context of Competence-based Education. Methodical competency building model is founded upon recursion. Recursion, as a technique based on consistent reduction of a complex problem solution to solutions to a set of "simpler problems" of the same class and obtaining on this basis the solution to the original problem, allows the teacher to build an individual route to form and develop methodical competency. Teacher performs different types of methodical activities (educational and methodical, scientific and methodical, organizational and methodical, and examination and methodical activities) in "non-linear" way, as well as assimilates the corresponding methodical roles (engineer, researcher, expert, manager, and teachers' coach). Actually, the beginning of assimilation of one role is accomplishment and/or continuation of the other role. Thus, the methodical competency structures, recursively referencing to each other, are developed out of themselves. © by The Author(s).

AB  - This paper looks at universities as training centers for a sustainable economy. Their remit is to promote the required competencies to achieve that aim, including competencies in sustainability. This article describes the role that the universities in Spain are fulfilling with respect to these issues and presents a training proposal that comprises four key competencies in sustainability with their corresponding performance indicators that permit the evaluation of different levels of achievement in training processes. These competencies must embrace their formative role not only with regard to future graduates who will be employed in "green jobs" per se, but also with regard to those alumni who will work in all the other productive sectors, in addition to all citizens directly and indirectly involved in the wider economy as consumers, producers and (direct or indirect) recipients of its effects. The proposal is based on the recommendations of the Conferencia de Rectores de Universidades Españolas (CRUE: Conference of Chancellors of Spanish Universities), and can be adapted to the teaching programs of different subjects in order to facilitate the training necessary in general competencies of sustainability within the ambit of the subjects taught. Furthermore, this proposal follows the institutional strategy of CRUE to promote curricula sustainability through the inclusion of the principles and values of sustainable development in every degree and educational program taught. This proposal could also be applied to other cultural contexts with similar characteristics. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - Raising children with good character has been a major goal for public education for the past 60 years in Korea. Contrary to their excellence in academic achievement, Korean students are at risk in their character development, including social and emotional skills. The primary purpose of this paper is to suggest the new concept of character education and strategies to implement policies successfully. To do so, the paper examines historical contexts of character education and related policy, and previous concepts of character education. Then, the paper globally explores what key competencies are considered important in constructing the new concept of character education and suggesting applicable policy strategies. A new concept of character education is proposed, consisting of three dimensions and six elements; social awareness and interpersonal skills in the social dimension, self-awareness and selfmanagement for the emotional dimension, and core value awareness and responsible decision-making for the ethical dimension. Finally, policy implications for the newly-defined character education are suggested, including competence-based curriculum reform, improvement of the teacher training system, strong partnerships among schools, families, and communities, and modification of high school and college admission systems, as well as the hiring system. © Korean Educational Development Institute 2013.

AB  - Purpose: At a time when secondary vocational education is implementing competence-based education (CBE) on a large scale, to adapt to the needs of students and of the labour market in a modern society, many vocational schools have recognised that interdisciplinary teacher teams are an important condition for this implementation. In order to provide students with the right competences for the labour market, different subject teachers should work and learn together and, by doing so, should be able to develop changes and improvements to ensure the effective implementation of CBE. In spite of the appeal of forming teacher teams in vocational education, studies on this subject show that teams in educational settings are not easily implemented. This paper aims to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, 28 managers from a Vocational Education and Training (VET) college in The Netherlands were interviewed in order to find factors that are related to effective team functioning. The authors choose to rely on a qualitative approach, because there has hardly been any empirical validation of factors that are related to effective team functioning in a vocational education context. In order to determine what factors influence team effectiveness, the results from the interviews have been related to what is known about team effectiveness from the literature. Findings: By relating the results from the interviews to what is known about team effectiveness from the literature, a framework for future research on team effectiveness in schools is provided. In line with the organisational and psychological literature on team effectiveness, the managers distinguished several aspects in their definition of team effectiveness. Moreover, the findings of the study highlight the importance of the development of task interdependence, transformational leadership, and group efficacy for producing effective teams in education. Originality/value: Although teams and team functioning have been the focus of researchers from different disciplines and have been studied from different perspectives, studies on the conditions that support or limit the successful implementation of teacher teams in vocational education are still scarce. The results of this study are expected to provide a deeper understanding of the mechanism that underlies the ability of teacher teams in vocational education to function effectively. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a classroom assessment aimed at determining the extent to which key sustainability competencies develop in students during an introductory transdisciplinary sustainability course. Design/methodology/approach: The paper summarizes three previously identified key sustainability competencies and describes teaching methodologies used in the introductory course described here to foster these competencies in students. The development of these competencies over the course of one semester is assessed using a pre-/post-test based on case analyses. The implications of these findings for academic sustainability programs are discussed. Findings: Based on the assessment used here, the sustainability competencies developed differently in students with different disciplinary affiliations as a result of the introductory sustainability course. Business majors did not improve any of the key competencies, sustainability majors improved systems thinking competence only, and sustainability minors who were majoring in another traditional discipline improved all competencies. Originality/value: The paper contributes to undergraduate sustainability education by shedding light on how sustainability might best be incorporated into specific academic programs. This information may help create more effective sustainability courses and academic programs, which may maintain the viability of current sustainability programs and promote the institutionalization of sustainability in higher education in general. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Digital literacy has become one of the key competences to ensure social cohesion, active citizenship and personal fulfilment. The objective of the project Digital Literacy 2.0 is therefore to develop and to implement an ICT-based approach to lifelong learning addressing especially disadvantaged groups and vulnerable social groups of people with special needs. Since educational disadvantage is closely linked to social exclusion and poverty, there is a need to empower the really "hard to reach" learning distant groups and to enable them to make use of ICT. This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The project partners are piloting a two-step approach to attract learning distant groups by offering an attractive starting point to information and social bonding: staffs at non-formal learning places like libraries will be trained for the use of ICT in their daily work with hard-to-reach target groups; they will gain competences in how to motivate socially disadvantaged clients to learn with the help of ICT/social media; adults from learning distant groups will be attracted to the places of non-formal learning by the use of social media thus improving their motivation to learn and empowering them to participate in social life. Findings: The project builds on the experiences gained so far in teaching digital literacy: special target groups can be attracted to learning offers by topics relevant to their daily life and offers that do require only a small first commitment to learning. Besides DLit2.0 will establish a new approach of non-formal education with the help of ICT. Social media make it possible to provide learning offers tailored individually to the learners' needs and thus increase the learning effects. Taking also into account the new opportunities of online participation and user-generated content, the concept of teaching digital literacy will be developed further in the project's lifetime and beyond. Originality/value: The network develops an approach to improve the collaboration between the non-formal education sector and the social sector. Staff from both areas will obtain knowledge and skills how to better understand the mode of practice of the other sector as well as to identify synergies and efficient procedures and to improve their collaboration. Information society has the potential to make a difference to the lives of people who often feel marginalized or isolated because of their social and cultural situation - DLit2.0 want to spread this issue to maximize this potential. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Schumpeter wrote that a "scientific" economist is competent in three "techniques": economic theory, economic history, and statistics. In addition, he mentions economic sociology. The current interpretation is that theory, history, and statistics refer to aspects of research that can emerge in any field of science. Their content and relations can be clarified with Mach's writings. Economic sociology is not a technique within economics, but a part of general sociology. The rationale of economic and general sociology becomes clear by considering Schumpeter's interpretations of Marx's ideas. Schumpeter's ultimate ambition may have been a grand theory following Marx's vision. © 2014 American Journal of Economics and Sociology, Inc.

AB  - This study intends to investigate the validity of a self-efficacy measure which is developed for predictive and diagnostic purposes concerning student teachers in competence-based education. CFA results delivered converging evidence for the multidimensionality of the student teacher self-efficacy construct and the bi-factor model as underlying structure, reflecting a teacher competence framework. Factor loadings of the bifactor model evidenced the theoretical assumption that incipient student teachers enter the programme with a global undifferentiated sense of teacher self-efficacy, having teaching experiences a further differentiation takes place to a partly differentiated sense of teacher self-efficacy. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the measure succeeds in predicting students' first-year outcomes and delivered evidence for the diagnostic value of the scale. © 2013.

AB  - The paper proposes a conceptual framework and industry-driven approach to measure required competencies of business graduates. The suggested approach was designed and tested within a project implemented in Austria, the UK, Slovenia and Romania. Evidence from this multi-country study of employers and business graduates suggests that it is possible to investigate industry requirements with a cluster of eight key generic competencies. Competencies were selected following a detailed analysis of academic literature and 39 semi-structured qualitative interviews. A survey was conducted with 900 business graduates and employers in four European countries. The survey confirmed that the eight key competencies selected were both valuable for business graduates' current job performance as well as relevant for future career development. Survey results showed that employers were not very confident in the level of capability of business graduates in the eight competencies investigated in this study. Results are consistent with other empirical evidence concerned with graduates' level of key generic skills and highlight the need to strengthen competency development within undergraduate business education. Implications for future research and curriculum improvement are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the Netherlands, many Pre-Vocational Secondary Education schools are implementing elements of competence-based education. These learning environments are expected to elicit the use of deep information processing strategies and to positively influence learning outcomes. While questionnaires are often used to investigate the preferences of students for particular types of information processing strategies in other educational contexts, these instruments cannot simply be adopted unaltered for use in Pre-Vocational Secondary Education where several characteristics of the students must be taken into account. This study explores the psychometric properties of three instruments for the measurement of student preferences for deep or surface information processing strategies in competence-based Pre-Vocational Secondary Education. The utility of a semi-structured interview, a questionnaire, and the think-aloud method was investigated. The questionnaire appeared to be the most accurate instrument and allowed easy classification of students in terms of their information processing preferences. The think-aloud method provided profound insight into the information processing strategies that the students preferred for a learning task and the frequencies with which the strategies were used. The interview results largely corresponded to the results produced by the other measurement instruments, but the interview data lacked the expected richness and depth. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Youth mentoring programmes in New Zealand are often school-based and almost all have educational goals. It has been suggested that overseas models of mentoring may need to be adapted to meet the needs of New Zealand youth. Utilising a mixed-methods design, this study explored the engagement in, and effectiveness of, Stars, a New Zealand developed, school-based, mentoring programme designed to ease the transition to secondary school. Participants (1642 questionnaires completed) were Year 9 mentees from eight schools across New Zealand. Results indicated that Stars mentees were highly engaged in the programme, but particularly youth attending low-decile schools and schools that were predominantly Pasifika in ethnic composition. In addition, the programme appeared to increase acquisition of practical skills, working with others, connecting to communities, meeting personal achievements, improving relationships with friends, and developing relationships with older peers. The impact of school-based mentoring on the development of the Key Competencies is discussed.

AB  - The need to develop key competencies to meet the changing demands of industry has made the introduction of competency-based training (CBT) reforms in the Vocational Education and Training (VET) system a priority in many countries. This article explores the views of polytechnic students in Ghana on the effect of CBT on the acquisition of competencies to perform professional tasks. The results show that the modular structure has indirect effects on the acquisition of skills through quality teaching and feedback. It is argued that assessment in CBT needs to move away from emphasising more on routine tasks towards the development of broad sets of generic skills and adaptable workforce. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper presents research results of the two-year pedagogical experiment comparing test scores in three subjects (Database Systems, Management, IT English) taught either in the ICT-supported way, or in the traditional face-to-face way at the Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. The main research objective was to find out whether ICT contribute to increasing learners' knowledge and consequently to forming key competences. Didactic tests as the main tool were used within the pedagogical experiment which followed the "pre-test - instruction - post-test - post-test2" structure. The research sample included 687 respondents. Obtained results proved there were no statistically significant differences in learners' knowledge in both approaches to instruction. The results were discussed from two important points of view: (1) teachers' and learners' ability to use the potential of ICT in teaching/learning and (2) the role of teaching/learning styles in the ICT-supported instruction.

AB  - In present-day society students are no longer expected to learn for stable employment, but for lifelong employability. This implies a major shift in educational approach. Previous research has shown which characteristics of learning environments correlate with students' competences to self-direct their careers, but until now this had not inspired intervention studies. Following a baseline measure (reported in Winters et al. 2009), we studied vocational training conversations during the transition to competence-based education in the Netherlands and more specifically before and after a specific teacher training. Results show a significant shift in the organisation of career learning conversations as a result of the teacher training, but also highlight the difficulty of actual behavioural change in educational reform. © 2012 Copyright The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to advance the understanding of the role design education plays in sustainable development. It presents a capacity building framework that can be accommodated in various levels of design curriculum development. The framework allows for a macro-view on the key clusters of competencies for ecodesign while allowing for alignment with quantitative and qualitative approaches to evaluation and assessment. The proposed framework does not intend to be universally prescriptive, and it should provide a context for the development bespoke educational programmes and activities. Design/methodology/approach: The research utilises a variety of data sources and methods to provide answers to the research questions. Empirical data were collected through the course of a two-year programme of capacity building with design educators in Wales. This two-year programme incorporated a series of workshops and scoping discussions with teaching staff. Additional data were collected through a literature review and best practice scanning. Thus, the research did not follow a linear process. Instead, it was performed according to an iterative process, evolved by interaction between a theoretical foundation (capacity building, ecodesign education) and empirical material (workshops, literature review). Findings: Design education may need to situate itself away from the traditional art or engineering setting to facilitate greater interdisciplinary learning. This repositioning of design education will allow for multidisciplinary relationships with other schools and communities such as social science, business or planning. There will be a role for the promotion of international design institutes that provide a more concentrated experience of the value of design and design education. Research limitations/implications: This paper sought to explore the context of capacity for sustainable development as it relates to design education. It briefly highlighted some gaps in the literature on capacity building for ecodesign education along with proposing a conceptual framework of key competencies. The intention is to initiate a discussion on the means by which these can be integrated into mainstream design education, lifelong learning and entrepreneurship training. Originality/value: There is no similar framework presented in the literature. Much of the research originates from original research conducted with four universities in a unique programme of capacity building. The paper provides the basis for deeper insights into the interdisciplinary perspectives required. This is something the authors hope to report on this year. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to provide insight into the interplay between student perceptions of competence-based assessment and student self-efficacy, and how this influences student learning outcomes. Results reveal that student perceptions of the form authenticity aspect and the quality feedback aspect of assessment do predict student self-efficacy, confirming the role of mastery experiences and social persuasions in enhancing student self-efficacy as stated by social cognitive theory. Findings do not confirm mastery experiences as being a stronger source of self-efficacy information than social persuasions. Study results confirm the predictive role of students' self-efficacy on their competence outcomes. Mediation analysis results indicate that student's perceptions of assessment have an indirect effect on student's competence evaluation outcomes through student's self-efficacy. Study findings highlight which assessment characteristics, positively influencing students' learning, contribute to the effectiveness of competence-based education. Limitations of the study and directions for future research are indicated. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - In order tofind out the gapsinkey competencies, those of employeesinindustry and studentsincollege shouldbeanalyzed. Key competencies of students and technicians in automotive fields are scaled and compared to each other. Furthermore, the differences between two groups are analyzed to check on the gaps. Initial test sheets are reconstructed as an improved one after the prior assessment reflecting the opinion of industry to execute reliable level assessment. The area and level of key competencies are set up by literature analysis and consultation. The average scale of key competencies is assessed by students and technicians respectively. Numeracy, understanding organization, technology skill, problem-solving, interpersonal relation, communication skill, self-management and development, resource management and information application are selected as key competencies in Korea. Three levels of key competencies are set up. Key competencies of automotive college and industry are compared. Regardless of areas, the gaps between the two are significant shows a kind of discrepancy between industry and college requiring a scheme to fill the gaps. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.

AB  - Focusing on vocational learning in the English further education (FE) sector and situating it within its social, political and historical context, this paper provides an overview of English attitudes towards the vocational and its subordinate status in relation to 'academic' education. It outlines the development of FE in England, describing its peculiarly working-class heritage, and discusses how the nature of the sector has changed against the backdrop of increasing global competition and the restructuring of the UK economy since the 1970s. The paper goes on to outline particular forms of vocationalism found in FE in England and considers some of the limitations of 'progressive' vocationalism and of competence based education and training. Following this, there is a discussion of emerging themes for vocational education and training, and the FE sector in particular, under the UK Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition Government elected in 2010. Continuities and fractures with established practice are considered. The paper concludes by highlighting the social and epistemological limitations of current approaches to vocational education and training in England. Whilst vocational education in England - within the FE sector at least - is once again on the verge of organisational and regulatory reform, there is little prospect that sociocultural attitudes to the vocational will change significantly, despite global transformations impacting on knowledge production and transfer. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Lifelong learning is not an international organisation or the practice of a specific country, but an approach that is of high interest throughout the whole world. Expressed as "learning from the cradle to the grave", lifelong learning has been almost a saviour in the western world and especially in the European Union. The idea for the development of lifelong learning emerged with the realization that the education system that had developed as a consequence of Industrial Revolution, dating back to when schools were first established, was inefficient. Lifelong learning spans across all learning activities in all aspects of life and is not limited to general and vocational formal and non-formal education. The European Union places special emphasis on this concept and has declared 1996 the Year of Lifelong Learning. Since then the EU has expected rapid social and economic adaptation to lifelong learning. The aim of this study is to bring the term 'lifelong learning' to a conceptual level in general and to emphasize the interest shown in this concept by the European Union, where it is used effectively in real life situations.

AB  - The ability to solve complex scientific problems is regarded as one of the key competencies in science education. Until now, research on problem solving focused on the relationship between analytical and complex problem solving, but rarely took into account the structure of problem-solving processes and metacognitive aspects. This paper, therefore, presents a theoretical framework, which describes the relationship between the components of problem solving and strategy knowledge. In order to assess the constructs, we developed a virtual environment which allows students to solve interactive and static problems. 162 students of grade 10 and the upper secondary level completed the tests within a cross-sectional survey. In order to investigate the structure of problem-solving competency, we established measurement models representing different theoretical assumptions, and evaluated model fit statistics by using confirmatory factor analyses. Results show that problem-solving competency in virtual environments comprises to three correlated abilities: achieving a goal state, systematical handling of variables, and solving analytical tasks. Furthermore, our study provides empirical evidence on the distinction between analytical and complex problem solving. Additionally, we found significant differences between students of grades 10 and 12 within the problem-solving subscales, which could be explained by gaming experience and prior knowledge. These findings are discussed from a measurement perspective. Implications for assessing complex problem solving are given. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This integrative review synthesizes research on emotion regulation and its implications for leadership, from both leaders' and followers' perspectives. Regulating one's emotions is considered an area of key competence associated with effective and good leadership. Three themes emerged from the preliminary synthesis: (a) emotion regulation strategies as facilitators of health, (b) emotion regulation strategies as facilitators of job outcome, and (c) emotion regulation as barriers to health and job outcomes. Findings revealed that leaders' emotion competencies, cultural understanding, and coaching ability and the quality of leader-member relationships seem particularly important for the efficiency of emotion regulation. Methodological shortcomings and future research are discussed. © The Authors 2013.

AB  - When young people decide to drop out of school they find themselves in a vulnerable situation (academic failure),that drags them out from having an active participation not only in educational context, but also socio-economical ones, increasing at the same time their risk of social, labour market and educational exclusion. This research analyses this situation of vulnerability and evaluates the possible factors that lead to it, such as personal and educational factors, behaviours, perception of mastery of key competences or guidance processes, studying several of them in a deeper way. It examines what kind of training alternatives these young people have in order to minimize their risk of exclusion and to improve their inclusion in society, labour market and educational context. The research is developed in Cataluña area. Using a mixed methodology (qualitative and quantitative) and a model for the triangulation or sources (228 young people, 16 tutors, and 9 entrepreneurs) and instruments for the data collection (questionnaires applied to young people, interviews to tutors and entrepreneurs, and documental analysis of 17 employment training programmes in 7 municipalities of Barcelona), this research demonstrates that academic failure is the result of multiple and interdependent factors and dimensions. It also shows that employment training and guidance programmes can be considered as a 'second chance' alternatives to access to the labour market or to retake educational programs.

AB  - Whilst an individual's cognitive skills are essential for academic progress, the possession of non-cognitive skills, such as empathy and ethical judgement are attributes required and valued in those applying to join healthcare programmes and by the profession itself. Doubts have been expressed, however, whether final selection using traditional interviewing methods serve adequately to reveal these key competencies. Kingston University and St George's University of London, therefore, have employed the Multiple-Mini-Interview (MMI) system for those applying to their BSc Nursing Programme. The MMI comprises a series of interview 'stations' where candidates respond to scenarios and are assessed on their display of required skills/competences.890 candidates and 82 interviewers completed a short questionnaire to gauge their reaction to the concept. There were positive responses from candidates with 65% replying that it was "a better experience" compared with traditional interviews. Unsolicited comment was generally found to refer to restrictions on opportunities to express enthusiasm for nursing. Interviewers likewise responded positively with 71% noting "a better experience." Unsolicited feedback indicated that some would have preferred to have had greater opportunity to discuss nursing issues, with their interviewees. It has been agreed that the MMI system of interviewing will be retained and further work will include the tracking of students through and into the workplace. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify and rate the importance of the competencies required by students for effective performance in a university e-learning environment mediated by a learning management system. Two expert panels identified 58 e-learning competencies considered to be essential for e-learning. Of these competencies, 22 were related to the use of technology. The remaining 36 competencies encapsulated a range of practices considered to be essential for learning within a social constructivist framework. Six of the competencies identified were either new or substantially different from what had been previously identified in the literature. A survey of e-learning stakeholders rating the importance of the e-learning competencies indicated that the competencies were not of equal importance. Critically, a number of key competencies from a social constructivist perspective that dealt with interacting and working with others were rated as being unimportant. This suggests that there is a disconnect between what the literature says about the importance of social constructivism to e-learning environments in theory and what elearning stakeholders perceive its importance to be in practice. © 2013.

AB  - Emotional intelligence theories try to identify the most significant emotional competences related to personal and professional success; however, they do not focus much on establishing hierarchical levels among them. The objective of this research is to conduct an exploratory study about emotional competences and offer an inverted pyramid model that permits their interrelation and hierarchical structuring, in order to predict the level of development for some based on the levels of others. To accomplish this, a Delphi Panel was constituted with 16 directors from large companies that operate on the Madrid stock market (IBEX 35). The results show a hierarchical relationship for the emotional competences of top directors in large companies based on their categorization into underlying, basic and executive competences. The study emphasizes that the most valued competences are active listening and effective communication. Using the proposed model, it can be inferred that, to develop these competences, various basic key competences must be worked on, such as initiative, flexibility, optimism and empathy, characteristics that seem essential for working in a context of crisis such as the present one.

AB  - One of the key competencies for a children's librarian is to know and evaluate literature for children - books, periodicals, audiovisual materials, websites and other electronic sources, etc. In this respect, children's librarians can add the most recent and relevant materials to the library collections, meeting both the developmental characteristics of children and needs or interests of each individual. The level of competence in this area is primarily reflected in the quality of library collections, and the impact on library acquisition policy. In addition, it is directly linked with recommending quality literature for children service and other information and reference services. Furthermore, being familiar with the literature for children as well as knowing how to evaluate it professionally has a large impact on the design of various library programs such as the promotion of reading and consulting with parents. Construction of the respective collections is considered to be the basis for the development of most other services. The question is whether it is possible to build and maintain the quality of library collections, and to appropriately design and develop other programs and services if a librarian is not familiar with the published literature. This paper will bring the results of the research aimed to explore the extent to which children's librarians of the county libraries in Croatia are familiar with the picture books for children and books for younger children. Additionally, it will discuss possible reasons for underdeveloped competencies in this area, and suggest some solutions for the existing problems. © VBH 2013.

AB  - Information society and knowledge economy are developing at a fast pace. Controlling the power and value of information has become a basic need for enterprises. But the number of information resources and retrieval tools for use by anyone within an enterprise has exploded in the past 15 years and replaced many of the traditional information services departments. Information literacy today is seen as a key competence for organisations on which they can build their productivity. A DGI working group for "Information literacy in enterprises (IK-U)" is currently discussing how to show the importance of information literacy as an individual asset as well as a corporate asset. This raises the question what organisations mean, when they talk about information literacy within their corporation. How does it impact internal productivity and what is the role of employees in the concept? The presentation looks at these questions and ends with an overview of the needs of enterprises with regards to the information literacy skills of academic newcomers. © by Clive Tooth, 2006.

AB  - The authors of the paper endeavoured to find out key competences in IPMA standard for educational approaches in project management. These key competences may be used as a basis for project management university courses. An incidence matrix was set up, containing relations between IPMA competences described in IPMA competence baseline. Further, discrete-time Markov chain was used to calculate the weights from the incidence matrix. The authors later considered the most important competences whose weight sum equalled 50% importance. The article defines IPMA standard competence minimum. Since the minimum comprises the standard from more than its half, it can be regarded as minimum for the creation and development of project management teaching and learning. The structure corresponds to IPMA certified B level (excluding such requirements as experience etc.). In the discussion of this article the defined minimum of the standard competences was compared with recommended preparation for individual certification levels. The findings show that real distribution of competences in the IPMA standard based on importance and real IPMA standard requirements for non-purpose and complex project management education differ from the structure of basic certification degrees of the standard. The authors further say that the education as such should exceed requirements for professional certification. The students should benefit from a complex training with emphasis on such topics and competences that would help them make a successful foray into project management practice.

AB  - Universities play an important role in shaping the future of the world society in terms of sustainable development by generating new knowledge as well as contributing to the development of appropriate competencies and raising sustainability awareness. During the last years, many universities have undertaken activities for implementing Higher Education for Sustainable Development (HESD). Many have asked which key competencies are most relevant for sustainable development and hence should be developed in future-oriented higher education. Different approaches for the selection of sustainability key competencies have been developed, but there is little international agreement in the debate around the most important key competencies. Consequently, this paper asks which individual key competencies are crucial for understanding central challenges facing the world society and for facilitating its development towards a more sustainable future, and thus identifies those competencies which should be fostered through university teaching and learning. The empirical design of the study is related to a Delphi study in which 'sustainability key competencies' are defined by selected experts from Europe (Germany, Great Britain) and Latin America (Chile, Ecuador, Mexico). The results show that twelve key competencies crucial for sustainable development can be identified; the most relevant ones are those for systemic thinking, anticipatory thinking and critical thinking. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Education aiming at students' competence development asks for new assessment methods. The quality of these methods needs to be assured using adapted quality criteria and accompanying standards. As such standards are not widely available, this study sets out to examine what level of compliance with quality criteria stakeholders consider satisfactory. Two professional education programmes specified the implicit standards they applied in a self-evaluation procedure designed to evaluate the quality of their Competence Assessment Programs (CAPs). They specified similar cut-off scores, but different descriptive standards. Analysis revealed that this was due to theIR experience with competence-based education and the quality of their own CAP, but influences of the selected method and the understanding of the quality criteria were also found. As such, the specified standards are local, but meaningful for the programmes' quality assurance. Implications for self-evaluation and standard-setting procedures are discussed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Introduction: The rise of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) professions has taken place alongside an increase in public use of CAM therapies. Some actions have been taken to establish educational standards, of en focusing on educating competent professionals to ensure citizens' freedom to make choices for their own healthcare while at the same time ensuring their safety. However, in professions like homeopathy that are unregulated in most European countries, it is not clear what it means to be a competent homeopath. The aim of this study was to investigate educators' views on what a competent homeopath is and what they require in their education. Methods: This was a qualitative study based on grounded theory methodology involving telephone interviews with 17 educators from different schools in 10 European countries. It used constant/simultaneous comparison and analysis to develop categories and properties of educational needs and theoretical constructs and to describe behavior and social processes. The main questions asked of subjects were "What do you think is necessary in order to educate and train a competent homeopath?" and "How would you define a competent homeopath?" Results: The educators defined a competent homeopath as a professional who, through her knowledge and skills together with an awareness of her bounds of competence, is able to help her patients in the best way possible. This is achieved through the processes of study and self-development, and is supported by a set of basic resources. Becoming and being a competent homeopath is underpinned by a set of basic attitudes. These attitudes include course providers and teachers being student-centered, and students and homeopaths being patient-centered. Openness on the part of students is important to learn and develop themselves, on the part of homeopaths when treating patients, and for teachers when working with students. Practitioners have a responsibility towards their patients and themselves, course providers and teachers have responsibility for providing students with effective and appropriate teaching and learning opportunities, and students have responsibility for their own learning and development. Discussion: According to homeopathy educators' understanding, basic resources and processes contribute to the development of a competent homeopath, who possesses certain knowledge and skills, all underpinned by a set of basic attitudes.

AB  - Scholarly literature suggests digital marketing skills gaps in industry, but these skills gaps are not clearly identified. The research aims to specify any digital marketing skills gaps encountered by professionals working in communication industries. In-depth interviews were undertaken with 20 communication industry professionals. A focus group followed, testing the rigour of the data. We find that a lack of specific technical skills; a need for best practice guidance on evaluation metrics, and a lack of intelligent futureproofing for dynamic technological change and development are skills gaps currently challenging the communication industry. However, the challenge of integrating digital marketing approaches with established marketing practice emerges as the key skills gap. Emerging from the key findings, a Digital Marketer Model was developed, highlighting the key competencies and skills needed by an excellent digital marketer. The research concludes that guidance on best practice, focusing upon evaluation metrics, futureproofing and strategic integration, needs to be developed for the communication industry. The Digital Marketing Model should be subject to further testing in industry and academia. Suggestions for further research are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to identify the main social competencies that future engineers need to become recognized professionals. In the paper the key competencies for contemporary engineers are examined and the focus is given on the importance of social competencies for professional development. A competency research model is developed taking into consideration the current research published in scientific papers, gathered opinion of students from Technical University of Sofia and early-aged operating engineers. The raised research questions are: “Which social competencies do future engineers need to possess in order to be successful and self-efficient in their personal and professional development?” and “Does the set of essential social competencies vary in different scenarios of engineering practice?” The received results after detailed analysis of university students' vote and opinion of the operating young engineers about what kind of social abilities are important for a reliable and effective engineering practice point to social competencies like: communication, teamwork, networking and adaptability are among the competencies with highest priority. These competencies are pointed out by engineers from Philips ETG as very important for successful social behavior too. Among the highest scored ability according to the students' ratings is self-management of social activities. That means that they wish to know how to manage their behavior and what kind of tools to use in order to be successful persons in their career development. The performed investigation about the key competencies for engineers results in a social competency research model that could support the building of a reliable engineering profile together with the required specific technical competencies. Successful professional realization requires not only specific technical competences of engineers, but also suitable social behavior. In this work the essential social competences for engineers are investigated and a social competency research model is proposed after comparison of preliminary students' vote, rating of students working on projects and gathered opinion of early-aged engineers. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to introduce and investigate dialogic interaction as a key element of achieving a transition towards sustainability in people, organizations and society as a whole. Furthermore "sustainability competence" as a potential outcome of such interaction is to be introduced, referring to the capacities and qualities that people, and the organizations and communities of which they are part, need in order to address (un)sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: The argument of the paper is grounded conceptually in emergent thinking among scholars preoccupied with learning-based change and sustainability in organizations and communities. Empirically, the paper uses two case studies carried out by the authors to ground the argument in real efforts by communities to create a (more) sustainable way of living. Findings: The main results include: a post-normal understanding of sustainability highlighting uncertainty, complexity, normativity, controversy and indeterminacy; a framework facilitating dialogic interaction; and a number of key competences that appear conducive to both dialogic interaction and a transition to sustainability. Research limitations/implications: Although the two case studies are quite extensive and rigorous, the conceptual nature of the paper and the word limitation did not allow for a more detailed discussion of the methodology used in the case studies and the contexts in which the two case studies are located. Originality/value: The paper adopts a post-normal perspective of organizational transitions towards sustainability and focuses on dialogue and dialogic interaction as a key learning-based mechanism for facilitating such a transition. Furthermore the framework for dialogic interaction allows for a more holistic approach toward such a transition and the development of competences needed to accelerate its realization. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Nowadays it is very difficult to avoid the information-communication technology. It is present everywhere: in the business world, civil services, education, at home. The ability to search, choose and use relevant data and information among endless choices, offered by the modern technology, is also seen as a key competence. This article presents the influence which the ICT has on the development of four-year-old children's competences. The present issue is a part of an extensive study which also deals with children's access to the ICT and its usage at home. The data was gathered with the help of 130 parents, who filled out a questionnaire and provided us with their opinions about their children's usage of the ICT at home. We discovered that the ICT influences the development of certain competences to some extent. We also tried to see if there are any differences based on the child's gender and parents' level of education.

AB  - As part of the European Union, Romania has established strategic goals for the transition to a high quality educational system. In this respect, the efforts to align with standards requested by the European Community became more pregnant. Romanian integration strategy 2007-2013 stipulates, through specific objectives, the requirement, that the education should be based on the development of a set of key competences. At the same time, we assume that the development of key competences needs an optimal correlation between the formal and informal learning. The individual performances in the personal and professional field start in the formal environment and can continue by virtual learning environment, as a part of lifelong learning. For creating the environment that helps learners to prepare for their career or to assess learner's progress, along with the standards from formal learning, we need content standards and skill standards for informal learning too. They measure the individual performances and help learners to assess their competences in relation with performance and occupational standards from business environment.

AB  - This article focuses on four case study schools that have adopted innovative competence-based curriculum (CBC) projects in Year 7 for a variety of educational and social reasons. The article discusses the issues and challenges posed by the CBC for teachers in the daily life of the classroom. Philosophical ideas about the purpose of education vary because they are driven by ideological positions. Consequently the nature and structure of the curriculum influenced by the stance adopted inevitably affects approaches to teaching and learning. It is contended that changes to the curricula in the case study schools have revealed tensions between traditional approaches to teaching and learning with 'strong' classification and framing and the new, more progressive approaches with 'weak' classification and framing. These tensions impact on teachers' identities and this can make effective classroom practice problematic. The article concludes that managing the tensions between traditional and more progressive pedagogies is worthwhile as this will enable students to become more fully integrated, and successful participatory members of twenty-first-century society rather than simply reproducing the socio-economic status quo, or the requirements of current dominant educational discourse in England. © 2013 British Curriculum Foundation.

AB  - The study set out to explore an array of key competencies required by psychologists, along with a method for assessing them. The respondents (n=353) were a representative sample of young Finnish psychologists with professional experience of between 1 and 6 years. They were requested to rate 52 statements of competence. A set of explorative factor analyses was conducted separately for four predetermined competence domains: client management, personal/professional identity and autonomy, consciousness of professional limits and professional development. In total, the analysis generated 11 competence dimensions. It was found that the extent of work experience was related to the ratings of these competence domains. For instance, newly qualified psychologists tended to rate their competences higher than those of psychologists with a few more years of professional experience. © Instituto Superior de Psicologia Aplicada, Lisboa, Portugal and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.

AB  - Mobilizing scientific knowledge for understanding the natural world and for critically appraise socio-scientific situations and make decisions are key competencies for todays' society. Therefore, it is essential to understand how students at the end of compulsory schooling use scientific knowledge for understanding the surrounding world. The objective of this study is to understand how students construct a scientifically oriented explanation while making sense of a phenomenon related to health. We analysed 526 answers to a question of a Portuguese national 9th grade science exam. The results reveal that most students present difficulties in explaining a phenomenon related to health supported by logical and clear reasoning, and in mobilizing scientific knowledge for connecting different scientific domains. We reaffirm the need to reconceptualize the role of health education within science education. Developing reading, writing and discussion activities related to health, which requires the use of scientific knowledge from different domains, would facilitate students' understanding and appropriation of scientific knowledge and its transference. This is a fundamental competence for promoting active and informed citizenship. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Purpose: To examine whether or not aggregated self-assessment data of clerkship readiness can provide meaningful sources of information to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational program. Method: The 39-item Readiness for Clerkship survey was developed during academic year 2009-2010 using several key competence documents and expert review. The survey was completed by two cohorts of students (179 from the class of 2011 in February 2010, 171 from the class of 2012 in November 2010) and of clinical preceptors (384 for class of 2011 preceptors, 419 for class of 2012 preceptors). Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations coefficients, ANOVA, and generalizability and decision studies were used to determine whether ratings could differentiate between different aspects of a training program. Results: When self-assessments were aggregated across students, their judgments aligned very well with those of faculty raters. The correlation of average scores, calculated for each item between faculty and students, was r = 0.88 for 2011 and r = 0.91 for 2012. This was only slightly lower than the near-perfect correlations of item averages within groups across successive years (r = 0.99 for faculty; r = 0.98 for students). Generalizability and decision analyses revealed that one can achieve interrater reliability in this domain with fewer students (9-21) than faculty (26-45). Conclusions: These results provide evidence that, when aggregated, student self-assessment data from the Readiness for Clerkship Survey provide valid data for use in program evaluation that align well with an external standard.

AB  - In today's knowledge-based society, in constant change and vertiginous evolution, we need men and women able to take decisions and to adapt themselves to an uncertain and unpredictable world. To achieve this goal in higher education context, we have chosen coaching as a methodological technique which encourages the development of human potential and helps the students to progress from where they are today to where they intend to get tomorrow. This methodology is based on setting personal goals and on the implementation of a series of planned actions that allow the subject to carry out certain ways of being and acting. The first step consisted in deepening in coaching programs: origins, conceptual definition, characteristics and functions of the subjects involved, information that allowed us to present a model we have implemented in teachers former education. Several phases have been followed in methodology implementation: a preliminary phase as a starting point to implement the model; the development phase, centred on the development of inter and intrapersonal competences. SWOT analysis made possible an assessment of the process and the putting forwards of some proposals in order to consolidate this model in the future, model which makes possible the acquisition of key competences for self-assertiveness and supposes a stimulus for a future incorporation into the work force.

AB  - Lifelong Learning (LLL) is critical for engaged citizens in the modern knowledge economy. The development of such generic or key competencies should be integrated throughout curricula, along with specific competencies in the disciplines such as engineering. This is a common educational goal in higher education in the USA and in Europe inside the Bologna Process. To enhance the capability of students to articulate their lifelong learning competencies, we developed a 'Lifelong Learning Competencies for Engineers' program for senior engineering students. This was presented as a workshop in a senior design course at the University of San Diego. The workshop includes presentations on lifelong learning competencies and specific recommendations for engineers, as well as an active learning exercise that helps students demonstrate their lifelong learning competence developed throughout their undergraduate career. Our mixed-methods evaluation reveals that the students improve their awareness of the importance of LLL atan important time in their lives as they finish their undergraduate academic career and move to the global labor market. Since lifelong learning spans disciplinary and national boundaries, this program could be adopted by other engineer educators and adapted by educators from a variety of fields. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.

AB  - The changing landscape of learning is helping Asian countries to emerge as technology-driven knowledge-based societies. The success of these societies depends on promoting the acquisition of key competences and broadening opportunities for innovative and more flexible forms of learning for every citizen. Considering that in Asia almost everyone has a mobile phone or will have a mobile phone soon, the author argues that Asian countries can establish and use mobile networks for lifelong learning. The researcher proposes each-oneteach- one mobile networks as an innovative knowledge-access strategy, particularly for Asian countries and in general for all the countries across the globe. The proposed mobile networks will work on the principle that those who want to teach and those who want to learn must have a free and open service to get connected for knowledge sharing. © 2012 International Council for Educational Media.

AB  - Education for sustainable development (ESD) has become so crucial that we have tried to smear it on anything and everything that's teachable. The consequence is that almost everything we do may be said to contain weak attributes of ESD even if we know nothing significant about it. This paper attempts to reveal an understanding of ESD that is informed by an exploration of policy language and agenda and recent literature in the field. The exploration of policy reveals the possible cause for previous inadequate implementation of ESD. An exploration of policy and literature reveals some key competencies that are advocated for through ESD. Insight into how policy has shifted from an ecological to a development focus and substantiation for why this shift is important in addressing current sustainable development issues serves to inform the interpretation of ESD. Finally, the analysis of policy and literature is triangulated to develop a framework that may assist ESD stakeholders in identifying ESD competencies in policy and practice. It is hoped that through this engagement with selected texts a more informed and complex insight into ESD and its features may be developed.

The database consists of 32 activities and background information, available free on the internet and which provide an opportunity for the progressive development of skills relevant to advanced level chemistry students. The activities can be used in schools, colleges and first year undergraduate chemistry courses. The structure of the database allows very flexible use, allowing teachers to select and sequence activities to suit their courses. During the pilot, users were encouraged to adapt activities according to particular curriculum and specification requirements. Importantly, the database was created to enable professional and transferable skills to be developed in a progressive systematic way.

AB  - This study focused on alternative images of the future of craft and design students. The main research question was as follows: What are the possible alternative futures for the craft and design field, in the eyes of Finnish craft and design students? This was examined through narrative storytelling, students' future stories (N=72) were collected in an eDelfoi database. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Alternative images of the future were explored from four viewpoints: operational environment, professional key competences, operational model and professional identity. The results challenge educators to pay much more attention to the issue of future orientation, as well as to changes in the operational environment and operational models. Further, in design education, a transition should be made from the current product-oriented model to a process-oriented one. © 2012 Intellect Ltd Article. English language.

AB  - This article analyzes Spain's educational policies in terms of emotional, social, and civic competencies. The need to teach these competencies at school is justified socially and pedagogically, and the way in which these competencies are implemented in Spanish and European school curricula is described. Spain's main political actions to promote social-emotional education are then described. The article concludes that for these programs to be effective, they must overcome a double challenge related to the practical implementation of competence-based curricula and transversal competencies assessment. Consequently, Europe as well as Spain must redouble their efforts (economic, instrumental, and in terms of assessment) to achieve their educational goals. © Korean Educational Development Institute 2013.

AB  - Despite the belief that schools tend to be resistant to change, it is possible to find secondary schools in the UK which are investing in the design of an innovative curriculum for their Year 7 (11-year-old students). This article focuses on four of these schools and discusses some of the challenges they face in planning and implementing their competence-based curricula (CBC). Such curricula tend to be based on the rationale that they better prepare all students for the constant changes of human knowledge and understanding. They develop transferable skills rather than subject-specific content, which are considered necessary requirements for learners as future productive members of society in the twenty-first century. Advocates of CBC argue that such curricula are more inclusive and emancipatory than traditional curricula, although this view is contested. Employing Bernstein's concepts of framing and classification of the curriculum, this article describes the challenges and constraints encountered by four schools which have endeavoured to develop a competence-based curriculum. © 2013 British Curriculum Foundation.

AB  - This paper presents a series of actions carried out in order to adapt one of the courses in the training curriculum of Foreign Language Teachers in the University of Granada (Spain) to the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). The course focuses on literature teaching. The final aim of the aforementioned actions was that of promoting autonomous learning and reflective skills amongst trainees, in order to help them become responsible for their own professional development. The approach followed relies on the adoption of a competence-based curriculum and the introduction of self-assessment and metacognitive techniques. The evaluation of the experience reveals a significant improvement in the capacity of trainees to manage their own learning, in their linguistic competence, and in their handling of didactic resources and material. This research is part of a project financed by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (SEJ 2007-62329).

AB  - Rapid expansion in scientific knowledge, changes in medical practice, and greater demands from patients and society necessitate reform of the medical curriculum. In recognition of this, medical educators across the world have recommended the adoption of competence-based education. This is intended to increase the rigour and relevance of the curriculum, move students beyond a focus on the memorisation and regurgitation of scientific facts, and better enable them to understand scientific principles and apply them to the practice of medicine. Experience from 40 years' use of competence-based curricula across the world suggests that the uncritical application of this approach to the medical curriculum may not achieve its intended aims. There are valuable lessons to be learnt from the history of competence-based education. By taking on board these lessons, confronting the pitfalls of this approach, and devising new and creative solutions to the problems inherent in this methodology, medical educators can better achieve their aim of providing a strong foundation for the practice of medicine in the twenty-first century. It is only through such a strategy-rather than the uncritical adoption of this educational approach-that we will have real movement and progress both in competence-based education in general, and in its applications to medicine in particular. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This article discusses how Information and Communication Technologies can support 21st century assessment strategies and what needs to be done to ensure that technological advances support and foster pedagogical innovation. Based on an extensive review of the literature, it provides an overview of current ICT-enabled assessment practices, with a particular focus on the more recent developments of ICT-enhanced assessment tools that recognise 21st century skills. The article also refers to relevant cases of eAssessment, looks into examples of the potential of emerging technologies for eAssessment and discusses some relevant innovation and policy issues. Reflecting on these examples, it argues that, although technological challenges exist, the more pressing task at present is to transcend the traditional testing paradigm and conceptually develop (e)Assessment strategies that allow to more fully exploit the benefits of emerging technologies in order to foster the development of 21st century skills. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This paper addresses some of the challenges involved in implementing the new approach established in the Spanish National Curriculum in 2006, which brought as a major change a focus on the development of key competencies. The paper focuses on scientific competency and the challenges involved in the itinerary from policy documents to classrooms are addressed in three sections: (i) an analysis is made of the changes in the science curriculum as a consequence of the emphasis on scientific competency, comparing the assessment criteria in the previous and current steering documents; (ii) trends in teacher education are discussed; (iii) the findings of the diagnostic evaluation are analyzed. The paper is framed in a theoretical approach, viewing students' participation in scientific practices, and the development of higher-order thinking as necessary goals of science education. We argue that the focus on competencies, characterized as the ability to apply knowledge and skills in new contexts, involves a major change towards knowledge transfer and higher-order thinking skills. Some issues emerging from the analysis relate to the implications of assessment criteria and the challenges involved in its implementation, to the trends in teacher professional development and the difficulties related to the current economic crisis and to the results of the diagnostic evaluation and time frame needed for reforms to have an impact. It is argued that the development of both competencies and higher-order thinking requires students' prolonged engagement. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In light of the rapid change in global economic conditions, youth employability has become one of the most crucial issues in youth policies among various developed countries. Enhancing the employability of students enrolled in higher education has gained the attention of many researchers and practitioners. This has led to a greater impact on ideological formation and practice within the higher education system in Taiwan. This study aims to construct a localized framework for a valid asscssmeni of core employ ability skills among Taiwanese students enrolled in higher education. Components such as "cm ploy ability", "employ ability skills", and "workplace competency" were investigated. Document analysis of government publications, academic articles and research reports among Taiw an and various other developed countries was conducted by delineating core meaning and components among relevant terms including "employability." "employability skills." "workplace competency." and "key competency." The results address four major domains and core components of youth cmployabilil skills. Based on such findings, a focus group interview was conducted with nine experts, including directors of career development centers in higher education settings, scholars with expertise and concern in youth employability. and directors who arc responsible for the national career development project from the National Youth Commission. Then, a localized framework to address core employ ability skills applicable for higher education was proposed. The core cmployability skills framework consists of four major domains: personal attributes/altitudes, learning/thinking skills, interpersonal/social skills, and career development abilities. Ten core empIoyability skills were included in the framework: communication, problem solving, teamwork, life-long learning, self-management. creativity & adaptability, technology, career planning, workplace cognition, and global vision. The framework of this study will provide a reference to the government of Taiwan for establishing projects and policies relevant to the fostering of youth cmployability.

AB  - Students' individual learning strategies have been identified as important skills in order to succeed in school as well as important for lifelong learning. The Swedish steering documents are permeated by an epistemological and a methodological variation based on the individual student's learning. Learning how to learn has been identified by the EU as one of eight key competences. There is not much research on elementary school students and meta-learning. This study is therefore aimed to examine these students' own perceptions of their learning, and compare how student think that they learn to their learning styles preferences according to the learning styles assessment Learning Styles Inventory (LSI). The theoretical framework is based on previous Swedish research and Dunn's Learning Styles Model. A multi-method design was selected. After the LSI-test the students estimated their preferences. Finally, interviews were conducted with 15 students. When comparing students' learning styles profiles to their estimation of how they thought they learn, there was a clear discrepancy. The students estimated more preferences than was evident in the analysis. This applies above all to the perceptual strengths, and time of day. The smallest difference, however, was found in the environmental elements. The interviews showed that students have difficulties explaining how they learn. What the students pointed out, however, was their need to work in peace, learning by reading and working on the computer, and also varied learning environments. Their response on learning showed that they were building their insights on the school context and experience from there.

AB  - This article explores the construction of learning to learn that is implicit in the document Key Competences for Lifelong Learning-European Reference Framework and related education policy from the European Commission. The authors argue that the hallmark of learning to learn is the development of a fluid sociality rather than the promotion of fluent task-oriented behaviour. They also make the case for greater attention to the embodied, situated, affective and creative dimensions of learning to learn. These are considered in the context of the main trends in EU lifelong learning policy over the last two decades, which indicate a narrow instrumentalist approach to learning situated firmly within the human capital paradigm. The authors focus on the internal coherence of the Framework, and on the tensions inherent in learning 'outcomes' that emphasise personal fulfilment and wellbeing, social cohesion and economic competitiveness respectively. This article is the first step in clarifying the epistemological basis of learning to learn, and wresting it from narrow identification with self-regulated learning and meta-cognition, and ultimately challenging a narrow reading of human capital theory. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Numerous benefits and advantages of different forms of CALL, blended learning in particular, offer a considerable boost for academic foreign language teaching with competences treated as essential learning outcomes measured by means of such indicators as the growth of the level of mastery of language skills (in particular listening, reading and writing), which make up the ability to communicate in a foreign language (the Council of Europe's second key competence). Research shows e-learning considerably improves the effectiveness of competence-oriented educational efforts. To this end the author devised an e-learning course English for Law and incorporated it in his English teaching practice at university. The e-course integrated with traditional classes allowed to achieve some promising teaching results especially as they went beyond developing only a foreign language competence. With the holistic approach taken, the results corresponded with the development of other key competences, especially learning to learn.

AB  - This article outlines the development of an evaluation tool for measuring student competency in macrolevel social work practice. Researchers followed a multistage process that incorporated the wisdom of experienced field instructors in identifying key competencies for practice, ranking performance levels in each competency, and evaluating the reliability and validity of the scale. The resulting Macro Practice-Based Evaluation tool includes six skill domains (learning and growth; behavior and relationships; leadership; critical thinking, analysis, planning, and implementation; professional communication; and values and ethics), each of which has five levels of student competence ranging from unsuitable for practice to exemplary. Evaluation in an experimental setting, by comparing student evaluations on the new tool and previous tools, demonstrated promising reliability and validity. Implications for social work education and future research in actual practice environments are discussed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The article presents the interdependence of employees' competencies and their training. First, the research background is described, followed by an in-depth analysis of employees' competencies and training programmes, and in the end the results of the research of the interdependence of competencies and training programmes are delivered. We have found that the employees whose education is related to natural and technical sciences have less developed social and organisational competencies than those with social-science educational background. All employees wish to improve insufficiently developed competencies with appropriate training. There is a positive correlation between relevant training and the key competences needed for efficient business, such as: professional skills, innovation, encouraging teamwork, managing development and the ability to find relevant information. Among the twenty analysed competencies three groups of competencies, the development level of which varies with regard to the employee's branch, were identified: i) development management, ii) innovation, and iii) motivation and result-oriented professional skills.

AB  - Objective: The acquisition of psychomotor skills is a key competence in the practice of dentistry, and innate abilities and motivation have been shown to influence motor performance. However, the explicit integration of these factors into the design of research projects about skill acquisition in dentistry has been limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive analysis of how dental students' abilities and motivation affected their performance in an operative task. Methods: A longitudinal study with two cohorts of dental students was conducted in laboratory classes forming part of an operative technique course. A range of standardised psychometric tests was used to assess different abilities before completing a cavity preparation on Frasaco teeth. This was followed immediately by completion of an Intrinsic Motivation Inventory. Results: Low but statistically significant correlations (P<0.05) were found between dental performance and psychomotor ability (r=0.22), and also dental performance and motivation (r=0.19). A significant difference (P<0.05) was found in the grades obtained for the cavity preparation exercise in one cohort between students with higher levels of psychomotor ability compared with those with lower levels (Tracing scores) (P<0.05). No significant differences in grades obtained for the cavity preparation exercise were found between students with higher and lower levels of motivation. Conclusion: Both innate psychomotor ability and motivation showed only weak positive associations with dental performance on cavity preparation exercises. Our study suggests that student-related factors only provide limited information to explain differences in performance or to be useful as specific predictors of future performance by individuals. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - One of the main objectives focusing on the subject of disability is to create a situation which will enable people with disabilities to fully participate in all spheres of social activities. In Poland the issues of disability and disabled people have been present in the public debate for many years. However, the changes in the social as well as economic climate of life justify taking actions and their adjustment to reality, so as not to marginalise the issues of disability in terms of the state's responsibilities for its citizens. One of such actions is the professional insertion and employment of people with disabilities. The paper will tackle the above-mentioned problems.

AB  - The self-regulation of learning behavior is an important key competence for university students. In this presented study, we aimed at fostering students' self-regulation of learning by means of a standardized learning journal. In two of four courses that were included in the study, students had to keep a structured learning diary and/or received further intervention on self-regulated learning through a weekly course. Students who received these interventions were compared to students who received no treatment whatsoever in their self-regulation and learning achievement. The study reports pre-post measures as well as process analyses. Results revealed that keeping a structured learning diary without any further intervention did not improve students' self-regulation. Those students who only kept learning diaries even showed a decrease in their motivation. Students who kept the learning diary and at the same time received further information on self-regulation showed increases in their strategy use and their self-efficacy. However, no improvements were found for students' academic performance. It can be concluded that in order for students to profit in keeping a structured learning diary, they should be informed on the benefits of self-monitoring to increase their motivation. © Instituto Superior de Psicologia Aplicada, Lisboa, Portugal and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.

AB  - This research aims to understand the key competencies and characteristics for innovative teaching as perceived by Chinese secondary teachers. A mixed-methods research was used to investigate secondary teachers' views. First, a qualitative study was conducted with interviews of teachers to understand the perceived key competencies and characteristics for innovative teaching among Chinese secondary teachers. Seventeen characteristics were identified underlying four key competencies that were perceived critical for innovative teaching. Secondly, an instrument was developed in order to validate the identified key competencies and characteristics and to measure teachers' perceived importance of the key competencies and characteristics for innovative teaching. A total of 325 secondary teachers participated in the survey. The results show that the four-factor model of key competencies for innovative teaching was validated and the importance level of the perceived characteristics was also identified. This research has theoretical and practical significance with regard to the development of competence-based teacher education programs. © 2014 Education Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.

AB  - In this paper, I develop a critique of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)-based lifelong learning policy discourse with a particular focus on 'key competencies' (KCs) and its equity implications for school curricular policies. First, I review the discussion of KCs in the writings by the OECD-affiliated researchers and other OECD documents. In so doing, I identify a marked decoupling of KCs from the initial lifelong learning policy framework. Then, I situate the discussion of KCs within the sociological critique of the new mode of learning deemed essential for a 'knowledge society'. I identify KCs' potential to naturalize the (re)production of inequalities through schooling and argue that this can be further compounded by the extraction of KCs from the lifelong learning policy discourse. Finally, I ground these expositions in the specific policy context of Japanese education, highlighting how KCs and its decoupled articulation pose a difficult policy dilemma for Japan's Ministry of Education attempting to address the widening class-based inequalities through schooling. Hence, this study critiques the contemporary school curriculum reform driven by KCs by tracing the flow of this concept from the international policy discourse down to the level of a national policy development. In conclusion, I call for curriculum studies to recognize the increasingly globalized curricular policy context and develop strategies for the new challenges of educational inequalities that confront us today. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate prospective teachers' perceptions towards their lifelong learning competencies. The research was carried out at Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University's Faculty of Education. The study group consisted of 551 4th grade preservice teachers. Data of the research were collected with "The Scale of Key Competences for Lifelong Learning" developed by Şahin, Akbaşli and Yanpar Yelken (2010). The data were analysed by ANOVA, the independent t test and the Scheffe test. The findings demonstrated that prospective teachers' perceptions towards their lifelong learning competencies changed siginificantly in accordance with gender and departments. It was found that prospective teachers feel that they are most competent in communication in their native language and least competent in communication in foreign languages and in social and civic competences.

AB  - The orientation of vocational education towards competence-based education has led to fundamental changes in the work of vocational education teachers. This article pictures teaching in innovative, competence-based vocational education in the Netherlands. In a multiple case study, the teaching practices of 10 teachers from five vocational schools were thoroughly studied. By examining not only the actual behaviour of teachers but also their related personal ideas and professional attitudes, we learn about the ways teachers implement new educational concepts and their experienced uncertainties, dilemmas and practical tensions. These insights lead to a better understanding and specification of the concept of competence-based vocational education at the micro level of educational processes, that is, the interaction between teachers and students. Implications are described in terms of new repertoires of teaching behaviour and teaching methods-all in the context of vocational education. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The competence-based formation is an open and flexible process for the development of work competences in which, from its identification and standardization, curriculum designs are established which makes it possible to guarantee a more effective work performance. It is sustained on the development and assessment of different acts, an innovative planning and it demands the beginning of changes in pedagogical strategies, curriculum approaches and the traditional role assigned to teachers and students. It requires the use of combined learning situations with a learning orientation to problem solving. A methodological proposal is presented which structures the process in four stages: analysis and previous study; curriculum design; implementation and curriculum assessment. The principal characteristics of each of them are explained. The model will provide the formation of a better specialist, with possibilities to offer a qualitatively superior performance that satisfies the increasing needs of our population and affords a better internationalist medical cooperation. © 2013 2002, Editorial Ciencias Médicas.

AB  - The European Union is concerned about the economic prospects of its member states as they have to compete against newly emerging economies with lower wages and high ambitions. Part of the strategy to deal with this economic shadow is to create a knowledge economy, but in order to achieve this, a shift to a competence-based curriculum model is seen as critical. Since the Lisbon strategy in 2000, policy documents have provided guidelines and tools for member states, but progress has been limited and in several states curriculum reforms which favoured competences have been reversed. This article uses interview data from school students from two projects in England focused on enquiry and learning competence, and analysis which draws on the theories of Bernstein, to illustrate their accounts of the difference between traditional and competence-based models. The data demonstrate the tensions caused by pupils' perceptions of the demands of summative assessment systems, which reflect a very different epistemology from experiential/competence models. The authors conclude that greater pedagogical literacy, attention to professional development, assessment reform and engaging students as partners in curriculum reform are needed.

AB  - Background: During workplace based learning students develop professional competences and an appropriate performance. To gain insight in the learning process and to evaluate competences and performance, assessment tools are essential and need to be of good quality. We aimed to construct a competence inventory applicable as an instrument to measure the content validity of workplace based assessment tools, such as portfolio. Methods. A Delphi study was carried out based on the CanMEDS Roles Framework. In three rounds, experts (N=25-30) were invited to score the key competences per CanMEDS role on relevance (6-point Likert-scale), and to comment on the content and formulation bearing in mind its use in workplace based assessment. A descriptive analysis of relevances and comments was performed. Results: Although all competences were scored as relevant, many comments pointed at a lack of concrete, transparent and applicable descriptions of the key competences for the purpose of assessment. Therefore, the CanMEDS roles were reformulated in this Delphi procedure as concrete learning outcomes, observable and suitable for workplace based assessment. Conclusions: A competence based inventory, ready for validating workplace based assessment tools, was constructed using a Delphi procedure and based on a clarification and concretisation of the CanMEDS roles. © 2012 Michels et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study is to investigate how key competencies can be incorporated into school curricula, what relevant instructional methods are needed and what institutional support is required to make school curricula based more on key competencies. For this, the study uses qualitative data from three schools (one each in South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand). The results indicate that a transformative approach, not an additive approach, is required. That is, teachers tend to restructure existing curricula to develop students' key competencies instead of considering the latter as a new teaching component. In terms of instructional methods, teachers are likely to believe that more engaging and participatory instructional methods would help their students to practice and develop diverse aspects of their competencies. Further, the principal's efforts to enhance communication and interaction with teachers is crucial to constructing local definitions of key competencies and shared visions for integrating such competencies with school curricula and instruction. The results indicate a need for redirecting the role of school curricula from transmitting content knowledge of academic subjects to developing students' key competencies. © 2011 Education Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.

AB  - As a vital component of construction professional services (CPS), construction management consultancy is in nature knowledge-intensive and client-tailored. Although recent studies have acknowledged the increasing role of this subsector of CPS in the attainment of sustainable construction, little attention has been given to the education and training of its main body, namely construction management consultants (CMCs). This study investigated the competence and knowledge structure of CMCs by taking China as an example. Using the methods of interview and questionnaire survey, three key competences of CMCs and the underpinned knowledge structure were identified. The identified competences are personnel quality, onsite practical skills, and continuing professional learning. Underpinned these competences are the knowledge structure composed of a number of disciplines including construction cost planning and control, civil engineering and construction, engineering contract and law, and construction project management. The research findings lay a solid foundation for future studies to probe into the role of construction management consultants in the area of sustainable construction. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In our paper we aim at reflecting upon the extent to which educational theory may be used as a framework in the analysis of policy documents. As policy texts are 'heteroglossic in character' (Lingard and Ozga, in The Routledge Falmer reader in education policy and politics, Routledge, London and New York, 2007, p. 2) and create "circumstances in which the range of options available in deciding what to do are narrowed or changed" (Ball in, Education policy and social class: The selected works of Stephen J Ball, Routledge, London and New York, 2006, p. 46), they need to be theoretically tackled in their underlying assumptions and implications. This proposal draws on an analysis of two sets of documents of the European Union: texts produced between 2000 and 2006, underlying the European Union programmes; and texts produced by a working group focusing on the key competences of Lifelong Learning (2003-2006). Initially, the framework for the analysis of different documents was grounded on the existing research in the field of educational policy. Now we attempt a secondary analysis of the collected data by transposing the borders of this particular and highly prolific field. We argue that what is outside the texts may reshape what is inside the texts. Educational theory allows us to define some conceptual tools in order to question the documents as political apparatus which open and constrain possibilities. Therefore, we will use educational theory as an arena where different matters, perspectives and possibilities may be explored and assembled. We have engaged in a conversation with both the data and some theoretical approaches. Central to this conversation are the concepts of "ignorant schoolmaster" (Rancière, in The ignorant schoolmaster five lessons in intellectual emancipation, Stanford University Press, Stanford, 1991), "learning contexts" (Edwards, in Rethinking contexts for learning and teaching, Routledge, Oxon and New York, 2009a, b), and "experience" (Larrosa, in Revista Brasileira de Educação, 19:20-28, 2002). © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The key competences proposed by the European Union are one of the most important education policies stemming from the work done by this supranational organization, first, because the key competences measure has a real impact on the educational policies of Member States and, secondly and more importantly, because this new educational approach aims to respond more adequately to the main challenges of contemporary society (something that other international organizations and institutions have been insisting on for years). Analysis of the original EU documents on this topic provides much food for thought that has only rarely been reflected in educational, academic and political discussions. This paper offers a thoughtful synthesis of the concept and implications of competence-based learning in general and the key competences in particular. Placing this new approach within the framework of today’s society and the lifelong learning approach is the first objective the authors propose; this would facilitate a deeper understanding of the competence-based learning approach, its significance and its relevance and above all would help to overcome the widespread idea in education that the competence-based approach involves no major changes from the status quo. The authors warn again pedagogical idealism: There are risks and challenges in this new educational proposal that must be considered. Altogether, the authors argue that we must not waste any further opportunities to really adjust our educational system to competence-based learning and, above all, the acquisition of key competences by all citizens of the European Union at the end of their compulsory education. © 2013 Ministry Education and Science.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to focus on the problems encountered in digitizing public administration. It puts emphasis on what is at stake with e-administration and underlines the contrast with the high rate of failure in managing such projects. After a review of why so many projects fail, the paper outlines, through the experience of a pilot project implemented in the Ministry of Finances in France, which key competencies need to be improved in the public sector and what could be an appropriate training program.

AB  - The inclusion of the competences in the Curriculum is generating certain problems, in the programming as well as in its development in the classroom. Its inclusion should not be understood as just another element, but, precisely, the conceptual and methodological change comes from the consideration of the competences as the axis around which all curricular elements must spin. In this paper, a methodological-prospective proposal is shown according to which this change in the process will have to be planned in two levels: inside and outside the classroom, through cooperative and interdisciplinary teachers' work.

AB  - We explored how two types of study outcomes, perceived competence and earned credits, are interrelated, and influenced by self-regulation, motivation (intrinsic value and expectancy of procrastination) and deep approach to learning. The relationships between these variables were analysed in a sample of 894 first-year Dutch university students, using linear structural modelling. Results show that learning process factors play other roles in explaining perceived competence than in explaining earned credits. Perceived competence and earned credits, as two sides of the same coin in competence-based education, are only weakly related. Furthermore, this study shows that it is most likely that perceived competence affects earned credits, but a model in which earned credits affects perceived competence as possible causal relationship was also accepted, although the relationship remains weak. The practical implication of this study is that, as long as perceived competence and the number of credits are not related, competence-based higher education will not obtain optimal efficiency. For participants and researchers in higher education, it remains important to be aware that different learning goals may evoke different study behaviours in students, and the challenge for higher education is to align these goals. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The 'Learning and Innovation Factory for Integrative Production Education (LF)' at the Vienna University of Technology (VUT) is the basis of the case study presented in this paper. One of the key objectives of the Learning Factory was to develop an immersive learning environment resulting in an integrated hands-on and 'heads-on' educational laboratory. One key-challenge was the utilization of the potential of problem-based and action-oriented learning and its transfer to higher education in industrial engineering. The teaching methodology harnesses the advantages of an interdisciplinary, experience-based and applied approach to learning and knowledge transfer, in order to build and hone the key competences of future industrial engineers. This is done in the context of a comprehensive approach to the Product Development Process, spanning the entire genesis of a product from product conception to serial production. Therefore, the pilot course was dubbed the 'integrative Product Emergence Process' (i-PEP). The presented case study shows the first results with respect to competence development for industrial engineers and presents the current approach of the VUT-LF and intended future developments. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.

AB  - In Australian higher education institutions, benchmarks have been directed at developing key competencies and attributes to facilitate students' transition into the workforce. However, for those students whose degree has a specific vocational focus, it is also necessary for them to commence their professional development whilst undergraduates. Familiarising students with the norms and culture of their chosen profession often does not occur through passive observation of subject content. At Griffith University in an undergraduate aviation degree, a community of practice has been established by the school, which develops student's generic skills and their identity as novice professionals. Our research examines the ways in which Mentoring Aviators Through Educational Support (MATES) provides students with the opportunity to develop their professional competence and experience through connecting with other undergraduates and industry professionals. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objectives: to evaluate the relevance of adjustments and changes in the curricular design and their implementation. Methods: a retrospective and descriptive research study covering 5 selected provinces where the medical studies are performed since 2003. Some qualitative techniques were used like focal group, evaluative survey of students and professors, interviews to professors and methodologists from the faculty of this career, as well as direct observation of the implementation process to obtain consensus criteria according to the scope of the set objective. All this information was processed through concordance and difference methods, analysis, synthesis and generalization of results. Results: completion, categorization and preparation of the faculty, after the intervention project to raise their category levels; characteristics and composition of the curricula in terms of disciplines and contents; the availability of basic digital and printed literature as well as the use of ICTs and virtual environments in and for teaching; the selection and accreditation of teaching scenarios, the assurance of methodologies and material conditions, all of which led to the re-design of the curriculum. Conclusions: characterization of the faculty and drawing up of the improvement and promotion plans, as well as the preparation of a novel curricular design, adapted to the new educational prospects, which comprises a competence-based curriculum with more flexibility, relevance, systematization, integration and contextualization. © 2012 2002, Editorial Ciencias Médicas.

AB  - The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has promoted the implementation of a teaching methodology based on competences. Drawing on New Institutional Sociology, the present work aims to identify and improve knowledge concerning the factors which are hindering that change in the Spanish university system. This is investigated using a case study based on a Spanish university which is a pioneer in the implementation of a competence-based curriculum. The results show that factors identified and analysed are conditioning the change and causing a ceremonial adoption of the competence-based system by the teaching staff. The results of the study may be of use as a reference and orientation for educators and administrators as well as for the regulators of those countries integrated within the EHEA. The study may prove useful in the analysis of inertia factors present when designing and implementing the policies and measures necessary to achieve a comprehensive teaching methodology; one which incorporates learning and assessment of competences in a real manner. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The need to set out the conceptualization of media competence leads to a broader perspective in which there is a convergence of factors linked to the digital and audiovisual competences, both of which constitute the reference framework for «information processing and digital competence», which is the key competence in Spain's national curriculum. Despite the ongoing experiences in audiovisual and digital communication few attempts have been made to define the knowledge, skills and attitudes needed for a person to be deemed competent in these two areas, which are essential for the teaching and learning processes. This paper analyzes six important studies on digital and audiovisual literacy, considering issues such as the recipients, the conceptualization used in each study and the dimensions they suggest, the type of taxonomy, indicators...and the educational proposals: objectives, content, activities are systematized in a series of dimensions and indicators to define media literacy and design activities for a didactic proposal in accordance with the indicators established. The development of this research has led us to affirm the need for convergence in terminology and the expansion of resources based on the indicators defined, which affect the diverse areas of media literacy in an effective way and function to enable teaching actions among the various groups that comprise today's society.

AB  - Thinking is one of five key competencies that are supposed to be woven into every learning area of the New Zealand Curriculum (NZC). The paper argues that achieving this weaving in the science learning area requires an understanding of the nature and importance of epistemic thinking. Epistemic thinking is pivotal to interpreting the Nature of Science (NOS) strand of the science learning area in ways that support learning outcomes related to informed participation in society (i.e. citizenship competencies). Such current and future participation is signalled as important by NZC. However creating a learning programme congruent with this intent requires schools and teachers to undertake a sophisticated weaving of the various high-level NZC components with the strands and sub-strands of the science learning area. Since many classroom teachers are unlikely to possess the knowledge about science that is needed, or even to be aware that there is 'something more' to thinking competencies that they should be addressing, the provision of appropriate forms of professional learning support is vital. Without such support thinking in general, and epistemic thinking in particular, is likely to remain 'everywhere and nowhere' as a specific outcome of science learning. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sexual orientation and gender identity are not commonly addressed in health and human service delivery, or in educational degree programs. Based on findings from Caring and Aging with Pride: The National Health, Aging and Sexuality Study (CAP), the first national federally-funded research project on LGBT health and aging, this article outlines 10 core competencies and aligns them with specific strategies to improve professional practice and service development to promote the well-being of LGBT older adults and their families. The articulation of key competencies is needed to provide a blueprint for action for addressing the growing needs of LGBT older adults, their families, and their communities.

AB  - The study investigates the main factors considered by telecommunications firms when making a decision to undertake Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This encompasses the reasons for investing, the methods of entry into the identified market and the factors influencing their decision. The methodology employs a survey questionnaire which was sent to telecommunication firms representing 80% of the revenue generated by this sector in SSA. The research reveals that market size, regulatory environment and government policy are the three most important factors influencing the decision to undertake FDI. Furthermore, the main reasons for deciding to enter SSA are for market and profit growth due to saturation in their existing markets, as well as for diversification of risk. They demonstrate the key competencies that South Africa Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) have in navigating the complexities of doing business in institutional voids. The liability of being from the relatively small emerging market of South Africa and operating in a country of institutional uncertainty has allowed South African companies to internationalise into markets that other MNEs will not venture into and thus turn a liability into an advantage. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the results of survey of the availability and use of computers in a preschool sample in Chile, and compares them with similar results of primary and secondary schools. Results show that although preschools have relatively low access to computers and teachers have relatively low ICT competencies, they declare similar ICT related obstacles and impacts compared to their colleagues in secondary schools. Also, results show that preschool students seem to use computers in the classroom more frequently than their peers in primary and secondary schools and that the activities they implement are focused on developing key curriculum related areas implementing tasks that can be associated to the exercising of key competencies and skills. This specialised use of computers in preschools, which is much more focused than the activities with computers reported by teachers in higher levels, could be explained by the relative low variety of educational software available in these preschools, the availability of the computers in the classroom rather than in labs; the special type of teaching and learning activities implemented at this age level and/or due to the relative lack of teachers' ICT competencies. On the one hand, these results highlight the need for further research, and on the other, it constitutes an interesting lesson for policy designer that tend to advocate for considering computers as "multipurpose" technologies that should be used across subjects, levels and teaching strategies. In this case, computers seem to play a very specific and concrete role in preschools classrooms that, eventually, contributes to improve students' outcomes, which highlights the potential of considering the use of computers, software and other technologies to improve specific subject areas at particular levels while designing ICT in education policies for this age group. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Disparity exists between the growing consensus about the positive effects of reflection on performance and the scarcity of empirical evidence demonstrating this effect. Portfolios are considered a useful instrument to assess and supervise competence-based education and to stimulate reflection. The present study describes the introduction of a portfolio in a social dentistry and oral health promotion course and investigates student reflection as a predictor for the acquisition of the other competences in the course. Methods: Fourth year undergraduate dental students (n = 110) in the course 'Society and Health' between 2008 and 2011 collected evidence in their portfolios, demonstrating the acquisition of five competences: the ability to (1) assess the oral health profile of a target group; (2) integrate theoretical models in health promotion; (3) search for and apply scientific evidence; (4) work trans-, multi- and/or trans-disciplinarily; (5) reflect on personal development. Linear regression analysis was used to investigate the predictive value of reflection on the other course related competences. Results: Reflection scores proved to significantly predict other course-related competences, when analysing all students between 2008 and 2011 and for each year separately, explaining between 10.7% and 25.5% of the variance in the other competences. Conclusion: Undergraduate dental students' competences related to social dentistry and oral health promotion were significantly predicted by the reflection scores obtained in a portfolio-based context. In line with the growing consensus about the benefits of reflection for dental students and professionals, results suggest the value to further develop the integration of reflection in dental education and practice. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Background: Critical thinking is one of the very highest orders of cognitive abilities and a key competency in higher education. Asking questions is an important component of rich learning experiences, structurally embedded in the operations of critical thinking. Our clear sense is that critical thinking and, within that, critical questioning, is heavily context dependent, in the sense that is applied, used by critical learners in a contextualised way.Purpose: Our research deals with enhancing science undergraduates' critical questioning. We are interested in understanding and describing the nature and development of students' critical questioning. The purpose is to conceptualise critical questioning as a competency, into three domains - knowledge, skills and attitudes/dispositions. We have no interest in a taxonomic category of context-free question-types called 'critical questions'. In contrast, our view is that 'being a critical questioner' trades heavily on context.Sources of evidence: Four cases are considered as illuminative of the dimensions of science undergraduates' critical questioning. Data were collected in natural learning environments through non-participant observation, audio-taping teacher-students interactions and semi-structured interviews. Students' written material resulting from diverse learning tasks was also collected.Main argument: Our supposition is that one vehicle for achieving university students as critical thinkers is to enable them not just to ask critical questions, but to be critical questioners. We relate critical questioning to three domains: (1) context, (2) competency and (3) delivery, and propose a model based on illuminating examples of the in-classroom action.Conclusions: The dimensions of the competency-context-delivery model provide a framework for describing successful student critical questioning, showing that students' capacity to be critical can be developed. It is possible, in our view, to generate critical questioners by means of promoting a true spirit of critical inquiry. The model also gives important insights into the design of teaching, learning and assessment contexts, where critical questioning could be promoted. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This article describes problems connected with the process of enriching technical studies with elective humanities subjects. One objective is to present a theoretical basis for psychological, pedagogical knowledge, and related sciences and their impact on the development of key competencies, values, attitudes and skills in young engineers. The other objective is to present results of the research carried out with samples of 176 students and 91 assistants and doctoral candidates, indicating the improvement in the key competencies during the study. Another issue under consideration related to elective humanities classes: which of these classes were considered to be needed the most by the test groups of students and assistants/graduates? The results indicate a significant role for key competencies with emphasis on several aspects of interpersonal communication in humanities education for young engineers.

AB  - Purpose: Teamwork is an important and challenging area of learning during the transition from medical graduate to intern. This preliminary investigation examined the psychometric and logistic properties of the Teamwork Mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise (T-MEX) for the workplace-based assessment of key competencies in working with health care teams. Method: The authors designed the T-MEX for direct observation and assessment of six collaborative behaviors in seven clinical situations important for teamwork, feedback, and reflection. In 2010, they tested it on University of New South Wales senior medical students during their last six-week clinical term to investigate its overall utility, including validity and reliability. Assessors rated students in different situations on the extent to which they met expectations for interns for each collaborative behavior. Both assessors and students rated the tool's usefulness and feasibility. Results: Assessment forms for 88 observed encounters were submitted by 25 students. The T-MEX was suited to a broad range of collaborative clinical practice situations, as evidenced by the encounter types and the behaviors assessed by health care team members. The internal structure of the behavior ratings indicated construct validity. A generalizability study found that eight encounters were adequate for high-stakes measurement purposes. The mean times for observation and feedback and the participants' perceptions suggested usefulness for feedback and feasibility in busy clinical settings. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the T-MEX has good utility for assessing trainee competence in working with health care teams. It fills a gap within the suite of existing tools for workplace-based assessment of professional attributes.

AB  - Objectives: The construct of 'preparation for future learning' (PFL) is understood as the ability to learn new information from available resources, relate new learning to past experiences and demonstrate innovation and flexibility in problem solving. Preparation for future learning has been proposed as a key competence of adaptive expertise. There is a need for educators to ensure that opportunities are provided for students to develop PFL ability and that assessments accurately measure the development of this form of competence. The objective of this research was to compare the relative impacts of basic science instruction and clinically focused instruction on performance on a PFL assessment (PFLA). Methods: This study employed a 'double transfer' design. Fifty-one pre-clerkship students were randomly assigned to either basic science instruction or clinically focused instruction to learn four categories of disease. After completing an initial assessment on the learned material, all participants received clinically focused instruction for four novel diseases and completed a PFLA. The data from the initial assessment and the PFLA were submitted to independent-sample t-tests. Results: Mean ± standard deviation [SD] scores on the diagnostic cases in the initial assessment were similar for participants in the basic science (0.65 ± 0.11) and clinical learning (0.62 ± 0.11) conditions. The difference was not significant (t[42] = 0.90, p = 0.37, d = 0.27). Analysis of the diagnostic cases on the PFLA revealed significantly higher mean ± SD scores for participants in the basic science learning condition (0.72 ± 0.14) compared with those in the clinical learning condition (0.63 ± 0.15) (t[42] = 2.02, p = 0.05, d = 0.62). Conclusions: Our results show that the inclusion of basic science instruction enhanced the learning of novel related content. We discuss this finding within the broader context of research on basic science instruction, development of adaptive expertise and assessment in medical education. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This article presents a sub-set of findings from a research project describing the experience of four case study schools which have implemented a competence-based curriculum (CBC) for students in their first year of secondary education. Secondary schools are highly departmentalised environments with organisational structures based primarily around subject departments and this can present a considerable challenge to such a multidisciplinary curriculum initiative. School leaders and teachers involved in the implementation and development of a CBC speak in terms of championing and legitimising the curriculum to their subject specialist colleagues. Teachers recruited to the competence-based approach were sometimes described as a mix of volunteers and conscripts and overcoming any initial scepticism toward the approach required the position and status of the curriculum initiative to be established within the departmentalised organisational structure of the secondary school, and required continuing advocacy for the competence-based approach. © 2013 British Curriculum Foundation.

AB  - Vocational Education and Training (VET) Institutions face serious challenges, like the implementation of competence-based education and upcoming teacher shortages, which urge them to implement Human Resources Management policy and practices (HRM). The implementation of HRM, however, often stagnates. This paper describes a qualitative study - in which 30 policy-makers and executives (members of the board, of the HRM department and line management) from five Dutch VET institutions participated - which was aimed at gaining more insight into the implementation gap of HRM. We identified several impeding and fostering factors, related to the content of the policy, the context in which it had to be implemented and the implementation process itself. Examples of impeding factors were the fact that teachers often did not see the usefulness of HRM practices and managers' incompetence in fulfilling their HRM role. Examples of fostering factors were the linkage between HRM policy and educational policy and a clear communication about the goals and features of the policy. © 2013 Copyright The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.

AB  - This introductory article accompanies three further articles forming a case study research project undertaken to describe the experience of four urban secondary schools implementing a competence-based curriculum for students in their first year of secondary education. The nature of such competence-based curricula is discussed in the context of secondary schools before providing an outline of the context of each of the case study schools. A democratic and emancipatory view of education provides the rationale for the development of transferable competencies, and this is considered with respect to the challenges of engaging in a cross-disciplinary approach to the curriculum. These challenges are viewed through the lens of Bernstein's concepts of strong and weak framing and horizontal and vertical discourses. Each of the accompanying articles takes up a different aspect of education, focusing on curriculum planning, teaching and learning, and leadership and management respectively. Further challenges with regard to changes in the English curriculum are briefly reflected upon. Finally an outline of the case study methodology which was employed in the study is provided. © 2013 British Curriculum Foundation.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to highlight the contradictions in the current maritime education and training system (MET), which is based on competency-based education, training and assessment, and to theorize the failure to make the training useful. Design/methodology/approach - A case study of education and training in the international maritime domain was conducted. Data sources include historical documents, rules and regulations concerning MET, syllabi, handouts, sample questions, field notes, an ethnographic study in a maritime college and interviews conducted with experienced mariners and course lecturer. Findings - There are contradictions in the education and training system that do not allow the targeted objectives to be fulfilled. Fundamentally, the assessment system has changed the objectives of the education and training practices from learning skills and knowledge required on-board ships to passing competency examinations. Practical implications - The practical implication of this research is valuable for the International Maritime Organization, marine administration and maritime training institutes to think over the competency-based system in practice today and how to improve the present maritime training and assessment system in order to achieve its authentic objectives. Originality/value - This research identified and bridged the gap in literature and research of competency-based training and assessment in the maritime domain and provides practical solutions for improving this system. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: Introduced in 2006, the objective structured public health examination (OSPHE) is a part of the examination for the UK Membership of the Faculty of Public Health. Designed to simulate real work in public health, the same five generic competencies were assessed simultaneously in each of six stations in 1 h 48 min. This study estimates the examination reliability of the OSPHE. Methods: Data from all 198 candidates, 54 questions, 39 examiners over 9 test days in 2006 were analysed for reliability and sources of error using multilevel cross-classified analysis and generalisability theory. Results: A reliability co-efficient of 0.85 was estimated (95% confidence interval 0.82-0.88). Little variance was accounted for by questions or examiners. Twelve questions would increase reliability to 0.92. More than one examiner per question has negligible impact on reliability. Conclusion: Multilevel modelling estimates examination reliability which is more rigorous than Cronbach's alpha. Traditional generalisability methods based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) are unable to do this. The reliability of this examination compares favourably with the literature despite having just six test stations and under 2 h per candidate. Other specialties could consider the use of parallel testing of the same key competencies at all stations within simulated workplace events. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - Several changes and developments (e.g., the changing labor market, growing worldwide competition, technological advances, and changing demand patterns in tourism) require new employability skills from graduates that enable them to cope with the changing circumstances of the tourism business world. Universities are therefore encouraged to embed key skills in their curricula, yet there is often a considerable gap between what educational institutions offer and what is needed and required by the industry (i.e., there is a need to create a hub and interface between the industry and the institutions of higher education). One attempt to actually create this interface and increase the opportunities for graduates to maintain or obtain employment is to look at diverse skills and competencies that enhance employability of graduates. Although there have been considerable efforts to specify employability skills, the question of how these could be developed within the curriculum prevails. The purpose of the present paper is to theoretically discuss the concepts of employability, skills requirements, and competencies for graduates and to present the results of a quantitative survey carried out among domestic and international Management Center Innsbruck internship partners to assess the required employability skills of the market from the employers' point of view. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article addresses the ideological challenges and opportunities presented by the European Commission's commitment to the identification of key competencies for education and training, and the development of indicators which can be used to monitor and evaluate progress towards these competences across the European Union. It explores the backdrop of global changes which bring the notion of competences to the fore, worldwide, and then reports on the European Union's framework for competences. The construction of 'competence' is an ideological and political act, since it is an indication of a particular understanding of the 'good life', which may be different when viewed from within a social justice narrative or a neo-liberal narrative. The notion of 'metacompetence' is explored as a means of transcending the binary tension between an economic and a social narrative. European texts are best viewed as complex and multifaceted 'collages' which are dynamic, rather than static, and the term 'competence' in the texts is a good example of this.

AB  - In the context of the European Union Framework of Key Competences and the need to develop indicators for European Union member states to measure progress made towards the 'knowledge economy' and 'greater social cohesion' both the learning to learn and the active citizenship competences have been highlighted. However, what have yet to be discussed are the links and the overlaps between these two competences. Based on the development of research projects on these two fields, this article will compare the two sets of competences, both qualitatively and quantitatively. It will describe how the values and dispositions that motivate and inform active citizenship and learning to learn are related to each other, both empirically and theoretically. Both these competences are tools for empowering individuals and giving them the motivation and autonomy to control their own lives beyond the social circumstances in which they find themselves. In the case of active citizenship, the ability to be able to participate in society and voice their concerns, ensure their rights and the rights of others. In the case of learning to learn to be able to participate in work and everyday life by being empowered to learn and update the constantly changing competences required to successfully manage your life plans. When measuring both these competences then certain values relating positively towards democracy and human rights are common in their development. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - The change toward competence-based education has implications for teachers as well as school management. This study investigates which professional development activities teachers undertake related to this change and how these activities differ among schools with various human resource (HR) policies. Two types of HR policy were involved: (1) a government-enforced, national system of Integrated Personnel Management and (2) a voluntary, integrative approach of Schooling of teachers, Organizational development of schools and teacher training institutes, Action- and development-oriented research, and Professional development of teachers. Semi-structured interviews with 30 teachers in nine schools with different HR policies were held and analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Findings show that teachers undertake professional development activities in five categories: maintaining knowledge base, applying and experimenting, reflection, collaboration, and activities indirectly related to teaching practice. Teachers' professional development activities were found to be relatively similar across schools with different HR policies. It is concluded that neither government-enforced nor voluntary HR policies seem to play much of a role in the participation by teachers in professional development activities. Implications for further research and school practice are discussed. © 2010 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this article is to help schools for vocational education determine teachers' continuing professional development needs associated with implementing competence-based education programs, so that these schools can develop better attuned HR policies. It investigates which elements from the cognitive apprenticeship model and from the acquisition and participation metaphors can be identified in the individual action theories of their teachers. Design/methodology/approach: A case study was conducted in one school for vocational education, where 12 teachers engaged in an innovation project around the development of a new competence-based education program for pupils. They participated in concept mapping, cued interviews (based on video recordings), semi-structured interviews, and a joint feedback session. These four sources were used for an in-depth content analysis of teachers' action theories. Findings: No distinctive, crystallized action theories about competence-based vocational education emerged at the individual teacher level; let alone individual teachers' action theories well in line with the two normative frameworks on competence-based education. The case study shows the struggle that individual teachers are going through to get their every-day teaching repertoire more in line with new ideas on competence-based education. Research limitations/implications: Only qualitative data are gathered, in one school, representing one school type, in one country only, limiting the statistical generalizability of the results. Not all respondents are able to participate in all four data sources. Practical implications: Schools should develop HR policies that offer teachers CPD activities in the crucial area of competence-based education; the frameworks presented in the study can be used to this end, by teacher educators as well as by HRD professionals interested in combining training programs with informal employee learning. Originality/value: The study draws on literature from various disciplines (especially educational psychology and HRD), which traditionally have remained mostly separate. It combines insights from four separate data sources. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Bologna aims to create a single and comparable European higher education area by 2010, allowing students and staff to transfer easily from one European university to another. An example of the Bologna reform is presented from the Biosciences programme at the University of Ljubljana, which is one of largest universities in Slovenia. The higher education systems of Slovenia underwent major changes between 1998 and 2004. The first level programmes at the Biotechnical Faculty at University of Ljubljana, the major faculty in Slovenia offering study programmes in biosciences began in 2007/2008. The implementation of the Bologna reform in the Biosciences study programme "in form " is almost complete. However, the reform "in-substance" has not yet been completed. The study programmes that have been reformed in Slovenia remain centred on the aims and objectives, but are not competency-focused. Competencies may be defined in the curricula, but the emphasis is still on what the teacher intends to cover. This article discusses competency-based curricula and learning as a key feature of the reform in the biosciences with an emphasis on the second Bologna cycle. The aim of this paper is to explain what remains to be done beyond 2010 to realize the benefits of the Bologna reform.

AB  - This paper explores and discusses arguments for the use of virtual environments and interactive avatars in supporting the achievement of student learning goals within conventional educational contexts. It describes and evaluates arguments promoted by some authors (eg, van den Brekel, 2007; Deuchar & Nodder, 2003; Dickey, 2003; Facer, 2004; de Freitas, 2006; de Freitas & Oliver, 2006; Garris, Ahlers & Driskell, 2002; JISC, 2007; Martino, 2007; Prensky, 2004; Prensky, 2007) relating to advantages from gaming and avatar use, ranging from enhanced engagement in learning activities, through to more purposeful and focussed communication, and, when used in group situations, better cooperation and collaboration between students. It explores the potential of avatar environments to act as powerful communication mediums for students to display knowledge and understanding, and engage in the development of 'higher order thinking skills, such as interpreting, analysing, evaluating, synthesising and solving complex problems'. It also introduces and discusses the avatar-based authoring program MARVIN, and identifies potential for its use as a digital storytelling tool to assist students in communicating outcomes from units of learning, and in supporting the development of a range of key learning competencies identified in the New Zealand Curriculum Framework (Ministry of Education, 2007). It profiles a successful example of the classroom-based use of MARVIN within a community project undertaken by groups of year 7 and 8 students at two Hamilton intermediate schools, and identifies how the program supported student thinking and relating to others key competencies (Ministry of Education, 2007). © 2009 Becta.

AB  - The European Space of Higher Education indicates the importance of linking the training in higher education with the professional world and defines a new frame of teachers' professional competencies linked to the new formative priorities students must acquire in order to fit the needs of the labour market. Hence, the importance of the learning process is understood as Competency-Based Education and Training (Cbet). As far as ICT is concerned, a great amount of studies include their basic knowledge and use as professional key competencies. Thus, Coughlin (1999) emphasized the consequences of the spread of new technologies in the development of professional competencies. In the field of education, commanding technological competencies involves being able to operate technical devices, knowing their main features and potentialities, and their applicability as training tools. Consequently, the aim of this research has focused on the advantages and disadvantages of the application of technological tools to the teaching and learning process in the area of higher education. © Common Ground, Beatriz Rodríguez López, Margarita Pino Juste.

AB  - The Bologna Process places special emphasis on the outcomes of higher education in terms of employability and key competencies. Taking Germany as an example, this article examines whether the introduction of a two-tier degree structure actually has led to an enhanced acquisition of key competencies. Based on constructivist learning theories, in addition, the article tests the hypothesis that an activating learning environment enhances the acquisition of both disciplinary and key competencies. Data are used from a survey among higher education graduates from 2005. The results of linear regression analyses suggest that the new bachelor programmes provide better conditions for developing key competencies, and also indicate what the ingredients of a competence-oriented teaching approach might be. © 2009 Society for Research into Higher Education.

AB  - Visually-based navigation is a key competence during spatial cognition. Animals avoid obstacles and approach goals in novel cluttered environments using optic flow to compute heading with respect to the environment. Most navigation models try either explain data, or to demonstrate navigational competence in real-world environments without regard to behavioral and neural substrates. The current article develops a model that does both. The ViSTARS neural model describes interactions among neurons in the primate magnocellular pathway, including V1, MT+, and MSTd. Model outputs are quantitatively similar to human heading data in response to complex natural scenes. The model estimates heading to within 1.5° in random dot or photo-realistically rendered scenes, and within 3° in video streams from driving in real-world environments. Simulated rotations of less than 1°/s do not affect heading estimates, but faster simulated rotation rates do, as in humans. The model is part of a larger navigational system that identifies and tracks objects while navigating in cluttered environments. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: The University of North Carolina at Charlotte, a doctoral/ research-intensive university, is the largest institution of higher education in the Charlotte region. The university currently offers 18 doctoral, 62 master's and 90 baccalaureate programmes. Fall 2008 enrolment exceeded 23 300 students, including more than 4900 graduate students. The university's Department of Health Behavior and Administration was established on 1 July 2002 as part of a transformed College of Health & Human Services. Case description: In 2003, the Department initiated a series of stakeholder activities as part of its strategic planning and programmatic realignment efforts. The Department followed an empirically derived top-down/bottom-up strategic planning process that fostered community engagement and coordination of efforts across institutional levels. This process culminated in a vision to transform the unit into a Council on Education for Public Health accredited programme in public health and, eventually, an accredited school of public health. To date, the Department has revised its Master of Science in health promotion into an Master of Science in Public Health programme, renamed itself the Department of Public Health Sciences, launched a Bachelor of Science in Public Health major, laid plans for a doctoral programme, and received accreditation from the Council on Education for Public Health as a public health programme. Furthermore, the campus has endorsed the programme's growth into a school of public health as one of its priorities. Discussion and Evaluation: It is only through this rigorous and cyclical process of determining what society needs, designing a curriculum specifically to prepare graduates to meet those needs, ensuring that those graduates meet those needs, and reassessing society's needs that we can continue to advance the profession and ensure the public's health. Community stakeholders should be active contributors to programme innovation. Lessons learnt from this process include: being connected to your community and knowing its needs, being responsive to your community, remembering that process is as important as product, and preparing for success. Conclusion: The efforts reported here can be informative to other institutions by exemplifying an integrated top-down/bottom-up process of strategic planning that ensures that a department's degree programmes meet current needs and that students graduate with the competences to address those needs. © 2009 Thompson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Strengthening the transition from school to work is a major educational reform issue on the Chinese Mainland. Starting in 1985, the government began developing a massive secondary vocational education system, which sought to have 50% of all secondary senior level students enrolled in a vocational education programme. In this study, qualitative research methods were employed to conduct interviews with principals, teachers, workers and employers in vocational schools and workplaces at three sites on the Chinese Mainland. These three sites include the eastern, central and western areas of the country, each with a different level of economic development. As the national policy stressed equipping students with practical manual skills (Dongshounengli) in secondary vocational education, vocational schools in these three sites spent over 50% of their total teaching hours on practical manual skills. However, the study found that stakeholders in the workplace perceived that adaptability, the ability to work independently, a sense of responsibility, a desire to improve and the ability to learn were actually the key competences in the changing workplace. Comparing stakeholders’ perceived competences in the workplace and at school, it was found that there was an explicit gap between what was taught in schools and what was needed in the workplace. Teaching and learning in secondary vocational education in China should pay greater attention to the actual needs of the changing workplace to ensure a more successful transition from schooling to work. © 2008 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.

AB  - This article builds on a previous 2004 Journal of Vocational Education and Training (JVET) contribution by Biemans et al., in which several possible pitfalls in designing and implementing competence-based education (CBE) were discussed. The present article reports on the results of an extensive research programme on competence development and CBE consisting of four empirical studies carried out in schools for secondary and higher vocational education in the life sciences in the Netherlands in the years 2004 to 2008. Based on the research findings, the article examines how the CBE pitfalls have been dealt with in Dutch VET. The conclusion can be drawn that the various pitfalls have received attention during the design and implementation of CBE, but not all problems have been solved yet. The article provides clues as to how the various pitfalls might be further addressed in the future to improve the quality of competence-based VET. © 2009 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.

AB  - In 2001 a new emphasis on learning for democratic citizenship has been championed by the European Commission's Communication on Making a European area of lifelong learning a reality. The communication recognizes active citizenship as one of the four "broad and mutually supporting objectives" of the lifelong learning strategy. Accordingly, civic competence, which "equips individuals to fully participate in civic life", has been identified by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union as a key competence to be given priority in all member states in the years to come. The article introduces the core principles of a European study aiming at investigating, from a comparative perspective, ways in which adults can achieve competencies relevant for democratic citizenship. Furthermore it presents and discusses selected of findings. The findings suggest that, in spite of the shift from education to learning for democratic citizenship within the European discourse, the emphasis on lifelong learning and the consequent equal recognition of in-school and out-of-school learning activities, most empirical research in the field of education for democratic citizenship remains primarily concerned with school-aged pupils. When available, research which focuses on the links between adult education and learning for democratic citizenship is highly theoretical and rarely supported by empirical evidence.

AB  - In this article, a group of four indigenous Mãori educators and one non-Mãori educator comment on a proposed amendment to the New Zealand National Curriculum Framework to replace the current separate sets of skills, values and attitudes with five generic performance-based key competencies. The paper discusses important parallels between western/European sociocultural theorizing on human development and learning (on which the key competencies seemed to be based), and the values, beliefs and preferred practices that are embodied within an indigenous Mãori cultural worldview (Te Ao Mãori). A Mãori worldview is characterized by an abiding concern for the quality of human relationships that need to be established and maintained if learning contexts are to be effective for Mãori students, and for these relationships to balance individual learning and achievement against responsibilities for the well-being and achievement of the group. Within such a worldview, education is understood as holistic, collective, experiential and dependent upon a free exchanging of teaching and learning roles. The article describes five specific cultural constructs within this worldview that highlight Mãori traditional understandings of human development and learning and teaching, and aligns and compares these constructs with the five key competencies proposed. The article argues that the worldviews of Mãori people in New Zealand provide an extensive and coherent framework for theorizing about human development and education, and are able to contribute strongly and positively to the development of a national school curriculum for the benefit all students. Implications for other contexts can also be drawn. © 2008 Sage Publication.

AB  - Background: Increased funding for global human immunodeficiency virus prevention and control in developing countries has created both a challenge and an opportunity for achieving long-term global health goals. This paper describes a programme in Zimbabwe aimed at responding more effectively to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by reinforcing a critical competence-based training institution and producing public health leaders. Methods: The programme used new HIV/AIDS programme-specific funds to build on the assets of a local education institution to strengthen and expand the general public health leadership capacity in Zimbabwe, simultaneously ensuring that they were trained in HIV interventions. Results: The programme increased both numbers of graduates and retention of faculty. The expanded HIV/AIDS curriculum was associated with a substantial increase in trainee projects related to HIV. The increased number of public health professionals has led to a number of practically trained persons working in public health leadership positions in the ministry, including in HIV/AIDS programmes. Conclusion: Investment of a modest proportion of new HIV/AIDS resources in targeted public health leadership training programmes can assist in building capacity to lead and manage national HIV and other public health programmes. © 2009 Jones et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Modern societies are diverse, complex, and in a constant process of development and integration which require university to incorporate qualifications in their curriculum which impart the competencies that make them relevant in the career of a professional working in a global world, and at the same time equip the student for exercising an equalitarian and responsible citizenship based on solidarity with fellow citizens. Intercultural competences can thus be thought of as key competences which are already being introduced into the curriculum and study plans of many Centres of Higher Education in Europe, and which are also now being introduced into the Catalan university (Spain). The psychosocial processes which emerge in intercultural relations and which determine the activity of the professional are in themselves justification for the presence of training for these competences in the university. Intercultural training has its own inherent objectives, takes advantage of a variety of teaching strategies, and generates a wide variety of impacts which have been examined and studied in detail by a number of authors. All of this governs the strategies appropriate to the development of intercultural competences in the university: generic application and the creation of specific subjects which can be articulated over a variety of formats with a high level of flexibility. © Common Ground, Assumpta Aneas, Alejandra Montané.

AB  - The appearance of the competencies demands two things: to fit them into the body of existing knowledge of the Science Education and to clarify his meaning. The main aim of the didactic unit project done about the Electrical Circuits Study at Primary School, its functioning, and the valuation of some of the effects produced on the student body learning. After having checked some proposals and contributions in relation to this subject, we decided to adapt the raised one by Pro (2008) for this educational stage. Once the materials have been done we tried to study how they evolved the subcompetencies in three experimental activities: realization of assemblies, description of observations, elaboration of predictions, interpretation of observations and predictions, and model use of electrical current.

AB  - The aim of this article is to analyse and discus the most important changes of the National Curriculum Framework and the fulfilled actions during twenty years of educational reform and discuss how the curriculum for general education should reflect modern education goals oriented towards the development of personal competences. The article points out the Strategy for Developing, Evaluating, Renewing, and Implementing of the curriculum (hereinafter- the Strategy for curriculum) as an important strategic educational papers. The Strateg y for curriculum foresees linking the curriculum with contemporary personal competences and creating a system for the renewal of the curriculum. Curriculum is considered as the definition that includes pupils' current experience, Content of the subjects teaching curricula, teaching and learning methodologies, context, methods for assessing the pupils' achievements and progress, and teaching / learning tools. Curriculum process is defined as the continuous development, implementation, evaluation, and renewal of curriculum at all levels of education. The Strategy for curriculum is to delineate the aims and principles of the curriculum process, the functions of educational levels, and the responsibilities in this process and to envisage the priorities, measures, and indicators of the implementation of the curriculum process. Since the beginning of the Education Reform the main attention was paid to prepare and periodically update documents that regulate the curriculum- National Curriculum Framework and education attainment standards (1994, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2003). New National Curriculum Framework for primary and basic education updated in 2008 and orientated to provide possibilities for each person to acquire the key competences required for lifelong learning and to seek better learning outcomes according to his abilities. Competences are defined as a whole of knowledge, skills, attitudes in a certain field, and proven ability to fulfill tasks. New Curriculum Framework for primary and basic education updated in 2008 describes how to plan the competences as the expected outcome, the question of organization of teaching, learning and assessment processes and creation of friendly learning environment is crucial. When developing a modern curriculum, it is important to stress not the input(what to teach) but the expected outcome, i.e. what skills and attitudes students should to acquire and what competences to develop in order to successfully build up their personal life and integration into modern society. The essential changes of new curriculum are contextualization of curriculum (civic society of knowledge and market economy) and individualization of learning. The paper stresses the importance of general competences such as information technologies and professional competences according to the needs of market economy. Individualization of learning should contribute to solving the problem of learning load, to appropriately selecting and using ways and strategies of transparent assessment of students' progress. The changes in the curriculum is the challenge to teachers and schools and enable teachers to change their teaching process to encourange the student to be active learner and to take more responsiblity for his learning. The teachers acquire abilities to differentiate and individualise teaching, purposefully use active teaching / learning methods and assessment for learning, and apply information and communication technologies during their lessons. The content of qualification training and teacher education programmes have to be harmonised with the priorities of the change in the curriculum. Education authorities on the national, municipality, school and classroom level have to negotiate and agree on further priorities of curriculum development, shared responsibilities and common actions. It is important in the curriculum process to develop the cooperation of teachers, parents, and all partners of education.

AB  - This paper is part of a series outlining a European Core Curriculum in Cariology for undergraduate dental students. The European Core Curriculum in Cariology is the outcome of a process starting in 2006 and culminating in a joint workshop of the European Organization for Caries Research (ORCA) together with the Association for Dental Education in Europe (ADEE), held in Berlin from 27 to 30 June 2010. For the areas of risk assessment, diagnosis, detection, activity, monitoring and synthesis Cariology, the present paper outlines the key competencies required and the related areas in which knowledge of and familiarity with are needed for dentists graduating at the beginning of 21st century. Three major competencies were identified: Risk Assessment- competent at identifying and estimating the probability for a patient of developing new caries lesions or progression of existing lesions during a specified period of time; Diagnosis- competent through collecting, analysing and integrating data on signs and symptoms of dental caries and assess activity status of a lesion on a tooth surface to arrive at an identification of past or present occurrence of the disease caries; and Synthesis- competent at synthesising all relevant information by combining and interpreting findings from: risk assessment and diagnostic processes; from patients' needs, preferences and best interests; and from monitoring, review and re-assessment findings, when available. Similar competencies were identified for erosion and non-erosive wear. Issues that were felt by the working group panel to be important in this field are discussed, as are approaches to aid curriculum implementation. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Background: The current shortage of human resources for health threatens the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. There is currently limited published evidence of health-related training programmes in Africa that have produced graduates, who remain and work in their countries after graduation. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that the majority of graduates of field epidemiology training programmes (FETPs) in Africa stay on to work in their home countries--many as valuable resources to overstretched health systems.Methods: Alumni data from African FETPs were reviewed in order to establish graduate retention. Retention was defined as a graduate staying and working in their home country for at least 3 years after graduation. African FETPs are located in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, the United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe. However, this paper only includes the Uganda and Zimbabwe FETPs, as all the others are recent programmes.Results: This review shows that enrolment increased over the years, and that there is high graduate retention, with 85.1% (223/261) of graduates working within country of training; most working with Ministries of Health (46.2%; 105/261) and non-governmental organizations (17.5%; 40/261). Retention of graduates with a medical undergraduate degree was higher (Zimbabwe 80% [36/83]; Uganda 90.6% [125/178]) than for those with other undergraduate qualifications (Zimbabwe 71.1% [27/83]; Uganda 87.5% [35/178]).Conclusions: African FETPs have unique features which may explain their high retention of graduates. These include: programme ownership by ministries of health and local universities; well defined career paths; competence-based training coupled with a focus on field practice during training; awarding degrees upon completion; extensive training and research opportunities made available to graduates; and the social capital acquired during training. © 2010 Mukanga et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The paper is oriented to professional and personality preparation of social pedagogues at TBU. In our paper, we will endeavour to elaborate a functional model of competences, which will be verified in practice and subsequent reflection on the professional preparation of social pedagogues at TBU in Zlin. We shall base upon the knowledge and observations contained in the current professional literature as well as working practices (i.e. praxis). Decision-making competences - on which our attention and activities are focused in this paper, are highly specific competences.The decision-making competence is not under-stood (by us) from the perspective of technical, economic, or social policies, but rather from the perspective of key competences - which are the load-bearing competences, and at the same time, include within themselves a dimension of other competences and these individual competences intermingle to various degrees as does their content.

AB  - This article reports on educational design research concerning a learning and teaching strategy for cell biology in upper-secondary education introducing systems modelling as a key competence. The strategy consists of four modelling phases in which students subsequently develop models of free-living cells, a general two-dimensional model of cells, a three-dimensional model of plant cells, and finally they are engaged in formal thinking by modelling life phenomena to a hierarchical systems model. The strategy was thought out, elaborated, and tested in classrooms in several research cycles. Throughout the field-tests, research data were collected by means of classroom observations, interviews, audio-taped discussions, completed worksheets, written tests, and questionnaires. Reflection on the research findings eventuated in reshaping and formalizing the learning and teaching strategy, which is presented here. The results show that although acquiring systems thinking competence at the metacognitive level needs more effort, our strategy contributed to improving learning outcomes; that is, acquisition of a coherent conceptual understanding of cell biology and acquisition of initial systems thinking competence, with modelling being the key activity.

AB  - In recent years, an increasing tendency to engage in project work that stimulates changes in pedagogical practice and presupposes monitoring of this practice has been witnessed in basic schools of Lithuania. During the period of 2002-2008, three projects promoting changes in education content were carried out. These were "Education Improvement Project" (2002-2006); "New Opportunities for the Development of Professional Competences of Vilnius Educators"; and "Networks of Learning Schools" (2006-2007). The monitoring outcomes of these projects serve as a basis for the present discussion of the features related to project work-induced changes in pedagogical practice. We also argue that these outcomes reveal potential directions in innovative thinking with regard to the aims and objectives of education oriented towards the development of the key competencies. Within this context, an innovative attitude towards education is regarded as learning to learn competence perceived as a major factor that can affect changes in the basic school. The article presents two theoretical models that serve as a basis for determining dimensions of competence- based education and for detecting manifestations of the learning to learn competence. Aspect analysis, based on these models, enabled us to combine reflection and determination of changes in pedagogical practice resulting from engagement in project work. This also led to the analysis of the prerequisites for the development of the learning to learn competence and to delineating trends of its manifestation. Research results of the projects discussed in the present analysis showed that these projects were intended to encourage the teaching staff to adopt innovative attitude about pedagogical practice. Teacher in-service training programs attempted to promote the training of metacognitive competences. All projects covered in the present paper were targeted on creating the conditions for the development of the learning to learn competence. The route to the realization of these objectives led from the explicitation of this concept to the determining of specific features and their actualization. The recommendations from research for those working on innovation stimulating projects aimed at promoting transition to competence-based teaching learning are as follows: To focus the initial stages of the project work on the determination of the teachers' attitude to the development of cognitive and metacognitive competences and to implement these results in the revision of the in-service training programs. To apply the experience regarding the analyzed projects when planning monitoring. This is recommended in view of the fact that, in these projects innovations were implemented systematically. The implementation involved a combination of active learning / teaching methods, reflection and monitoring of pedagogical practice.

AB  - International companies are recognised by equity between men and women as well as between other different groups (Diversity) as an economic factor and incorporate it into their company visions. Mixed teams are set up to design target group-oriented products, for example in automotive engineering. Therefore they need employees who represent the different target groups, leading to a better integration of women and minority groups into their work force. The Managing Diversity approach is entering the German or European labour market via internationally working companies from the US, where Managing Diversity has been on the agenda for many years. At the same time, industry and universities in Germany face a huge problem: the lack of personnel in technical professions, especially the absence of women and of technically gifted, but not technically interested men. Additionally, during recent years, industry claims that the non-technical basic knowledge of graduates is very poor—and these are the competences that are important for successful cooperation processes. The current article will first describe the theoretical basis of teaching and learning diversity as a key competence and then show an example of implementing diversity and key competences in the traditional engineering curriculum. © 2007, Copyright SEFI.

AB  - Since 1998, the Flanders' educational government in Belgium has been urging teacher education institutions by decree to implement competences in teacher training programs. Since then, years have gone by, and institutions have acted in order to achieve the competence-based goals. However, have they succeeded in implementing them? This is the research question that is central to the current study. An online survey inquiry was set up in eight elementary teacher education institutions using two questionnaires; one for final year elementary institution pre-service teachers, who were about to graduate at the time of completing the questionnaire (N = 218), the other for teacher trainers throughout the elementary teacher training program (N = 51). Ten years after the decree was issued, results show that competence-based education has become a reality in terms of its implementation. However, the process has not yet come to an end. Whereas some competences are clearly present in the institutions' policies and practices (e.g. teacher as guide to learning and development, teacher as subject expert), others are poorly represented (e.g. teacher as partner of parents, external parties and as a member of the educational community). Moreover, teacher trainers tend to take four different approaches to the implementation of competences (1) during internship, (2) through the institution's policy and program planning, (3) by means of their integration in both theoretical and practical components of the curriculum and finally, (4) a lack of implementation because the competences are considered insufficiently applicable by the teacher trainers. In particular, more experienced and subject expert teacher trainers tend to adopt the final approach more often than do younger colleagues and pedagogues. Student teachers' results, on the other hand, suggest important differences between institutions concerning their understanding of competences and the integration of these competences in the curriculum; suggesting different paces of adaptation between teacher education institutions. Moreover, even within schools, the trajectory towards implementation is not always clear for all members of the teaching team, nor for the students of most teacher education institutions. Consequently, there is still important work to be done in order for successful competence-based change to occur. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Educational processes are being regarded as crucial. One objective is to change unsustainable behaviour through education. However, such a tool-oriented understanding of education should be criticised from an educational perspective. Accordingly, this article addresses two main aspects. First, educational opportunities as well as limitations are discussed in reference to the shift from a threat-oriented environmental education to an education for sustainable development that is interested in contributing to a proactive shaping of future developments. Second, appropriate educational objectives of this approach are explored by illustrating ways of combining these with a meaningful content and adequate learning settings.

AB  - The aim of this article is to raise discussion on the internationalisation possibilities of master's students who study while working. The objective of the article is to describe and share experiences on how to make the development of students' internationalisation competence possible through collaboration with representatives of different cultures during a one-week intensive course. Internationalisation is an essential component in the competence-based curriculum of master's level social and healthcare education. On the other hand, it has been a difficult task for adult students to enhance their internationalisation competence when they pursue studies alongside work. In addition, internationalisation in master's level education has been a key feature both in Finland and in Russia. An intensive course is one educational method to share students' existing professional know-how in an international multi-professional student group and to enable adult students' mobility. This paper describes a one-week intensive course which was carried out in St. Petersburg, Russia in autumn 2008. The course was evaluated by the adult students and their teachers participating in the course. The intensive course increased the degree of transparency and compatibility between higher education and advanced professional education qualifications gained in postgraduate healthcare education in the partner organisations. It seems that an intensive course is a good pedagogical method for enhancing the internationalisation competence of adult students. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Dutch prevocational secondary schools are reforming their educational programmes to make them more competence-based. This reform has substantial implications for the roles played by teachers. Yet, little empirical research has been conducted on teachers’ processes of competence development in vocational settings. This study explores teachers’ individual action theories regarding the introduction of competence-based prevocational secondary education. The cognitive apprenticeship model provides a conceptual framework for addressing this issue. The research questions addressed here are: How do teachers value elements of the cognitive apprenticeship model in designing and delivering competence-based prevocational secondary education?, and, What individual action theories do teachers have regarding competence-based prevocational secondary education? The study was designed in two phases. In the qualitative phase, interviews and concept map techniques were used, while the quantitative phase employed a questionnaire. Teachers valued elements of the cognitive apprenticeship model differently, and suggested two additional features: a custom-made educational approach and the professionalisation of teachers. © 2009 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.

AB  - Over the last 20 years, Poland has gone through a major transition process in which the challenges for education in terms of new approaches to learning and teaching have been compounded by broader changes such as the democratisation of structures and processes and the major economic and social changes. This article is a case study that examines the early stages of significant shifts in the learning and teaching process, the stepped approach that was taken and the different international influences. It was decided to focus on the top-down, policy level actions in order to trace how influences have shaped current policy on outcomes-based approaches and key competences, which are increasingly implemented in schools today. The Polish education and training system has been through a complex series of reforms, many simultaneously. The introduction of outcome-based approaches and key competences is part of much broader reforms that have affected mindsets and attitudes by having addressed the structure of the system (e.g. the length of compulsory education), school governance, the roles of principals and teachers, teacher training, etc. Parents' expectations have evolved and students are growing up in a much more connected environment with Internet and social networks and an exponential development of access to ICT and the need for digital competences and a range of key competences for lifelong learning and work (Gordon etal., 2009). Although change has taken place at all levels and in all sub-sectors of the system, this article focuses on general education in primary and secondary schools. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - We describe the work recently done in the adaptation to the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) of a mathematics education course of the Kindergarten Education Teaching degree which is offered in the three sections of the University of Granada: Ceuta, Granada and Melilla. Within an innovation project financed by the "Vicerrectorado de Planificación, Calidad y Evaluación Docente" of the University of Granada, we have use micro-projects as a curricular product that articulate theory, practice and professional reflection to redesign the subject "Development of mathematical thinking and its didactic". Starting from practical activities and working in small groups, students and teachers look to related theory using three focuses of reflection: the child, the mathematics, and kindergarten education. The main objectives of this course are to elicit reflection as a professional attitude and to initiate students in professional problems, all in the context of mathematics education. We also try to promote the development of other key competences highlighted in the project Tuning such as collaborative work, autonomy, decisions making and critical and self-critical capacity. © Common Ground.

AB  - The evolution in Europe towards more competence-based curricula in the last ten years or so is the result of several exogenous factors and a determined European policy. The Reference Framework of Key Competences for Lifelong Learning, a Recommendation approved by the European Parliament and the Council in 2006, and the work carried out within the Open Method of Coordination as well as by European research bodies have had a significant impact on Member States' curriculum reforms. This article shows that some terminology issues, both conceptual and practical, may explain, together with other causes, the diverse formulations of key competences and the way in which they are being integrated into the compulsory education curricula by the Member States or at intra-national levels. The focus of the article is on cross-curricular competences because these are the key competences which require the most significant innovations in teaching and learning practices, on assessment tools and procedures, and school organisation. The analysis illustrates the main differences and convergences in policy formulation and implementation strategies among the EU Member States. It also identifies key obstacles that must be overcome for an effective implementation before suggesting some policy recommendations. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the development of student knowledge in pre-vocational secondary education schools which differ in the manner and extent to which they have implemented characteristics of competence-based education. The implementation of these characteristics was examined using a teacher questionnaire and the development of knowledge was investigated using concept mapping. The results showed that students developed slightly more knowledge in learning situations with fewer characteristics of competence-based education. The organisational characteristics of the learning situations were further found to be distinctive for the development of knowledge. © 2011 The Author(s).

AB  - Modern dental education should have in on one hand the necessary education and training to make modern dentists capable of implementing population and individual preventive strategies, and on the other make them competent to satisfy current public demands to most patients. Amongst the restorative procedures most demanded by patients implant therapy has reached a clear pre-dominance. Although specialists have traditionally rendered this therapeutic procedure, in simple cases there is seldom need for extensive surgical procedures and therefore there is a clear need to introduce these studies in modern dental curricula. To facilitate the harmonisation and convergence of dental education in Europe, the Association for Dental Education in Europe and DentEd have defined a set of competencies for the graduating dentist in the EU. Using the same framework, we herein define the agreed competencies in implant dentistry, within the different domains, for both the undergraduate and the postgraduate student. Within a context of a competence-based curriculum implant dentistry should be taught as part of the major and supportive competencies described with a strong emphasis on inter-disciplinarity and integration. © 2009 Blackwell Munksgaard.

AB  - The goal of this article is to contribute to the validation of a self-evaluation method, which can be used by schools to evaluate the quality of their Competence Assessment Program (CAP). The outcomes of the self-evaluations of two schools are systematically compared: a novice school with little experience in competence-based education and assessment, and an innovative school with extensive experience. The self-evaluation was based on 12 quality criteria for CAPs, including both validity and reliability, and criteria stressing the importance of the formative function of assessment, such as meaningfulness and educational consequences. In each school, teachers, management and examination board participated. Results show that the two schools use different approaches to assure assessment quality. The innovative school seems to be more aware of its own strengths and weaknesses, to have a more positive attitude towards teachers, students, and educational innovations, and to explicitly involve stakeholders (i.e., teachers, students, and the work field) in their assessments. This school also had a more explicit vision of the goal of competence-based education and could design its assessments in accordance with these goals. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the globalized economies e-permeation has become a basic condition in our everyday lives. ICT can no longer be understood solely as artefacts and tools and computer-related literacy are no longer restricted to the ability to operate digital tools for specific purposes. The network society, and therefore also eLearning are characterized by fluidity and the key competence for social actors in this ever changing e-permeated environment is the ability to cope with change - or Castells' conceptualisation self-programming. Castells' theory has influenced international definitions of future key competencies. Both lifelong learning and digital literacy understood as bildung have emerged as central for the definitions of and standards for future key competencies. However, definitions and standards only tell us about the desired destination and outcome of digital competence building. They tell us nothing about how we may get there. In the educational system ICT and e-learning are becoming an everyday condition and the basic challenge for the educational system is twofold: 1) The actually making of digital literate and self-programming social actors - students and teachers; and 2) How to develop adequate designs for teaching and learning for that purpose. We need research that aims to describe the phenomenology of acquiring digital literacy and self-programming in order to be able to identify relevant learning objectives and scaffolding. Findings from such studies are expected to be relevant for eLearning scenarios as well as for ICT and designs for learning in general. This paper presents a case study that aimed to explore the phenomenological appearance of self-programming as agency and learning among postgraduate students who participated in a specially designed eLearning workshop in the autumn 2009. The findings relate to both the individual and collaborative barriers and proactive strategies that come into play among the students. Drawing on the findings, it is argued that the presented workshop design contributes to the networked society's design for ICT, teaching and learning, as the design - at least for this small group of students - have proved to support the development of digital self-programming as a sustainable competence. In the autumn 2010 the study will be expanded to a larger group of students. © Academic Publishing International Ltd.

AB  - The emerging academic field focused on sustainability has been engaged in a rich and converging debate to define what key competencies are considered critical for graduating students to possess. For more than a decade, sustainability courses have been developed and taught in higher education, yet comprehensive academic programs in sustainability, on the undergraduate and graduate level, have emerged only over the last few years. Considering this recent institutional momentum, the time is seemingly right to synthesize the discussion about key competencies in sustainability in order to support these relatively young academic programs in shaping their profiles and achieving their ambitious missions. This article presents the results of a broad literature review. The review identifies the relevant literature on key competencies in sustainability; synthesizes the substantive contributions in a coherent framework of sustainability research and problem-solving competence; and addresses critical gaps in the conceptualization of key competencies in sustainability. Insights from this study lay the groundwork for institutional advancements in designing and revising academic programs; teaching and learning evaluations; as well as hiring and training faculty and staff. © 2011 Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science, United Nations University, and Springer.

AB  - From September 2009 onwards, a new business curriculum which focuses on three key business disciplines, namely management, accounting and finance, has been implemented in Hong Kong senior secondary schools. A new assessment guide has been also proposed in light of the new curriculum. Such business curriculum and assessment reform move in the direction of preparing pupils to be more adaptive to the fast-changing business society; an innovative school-based pedagogical design will definitely be needed. This paper examines and analyzes the nature of the existing Hong Kong business curriculum and assessment reform from a competence-based perspective, discusses the critical issues in the areas of curriculum design, assessment practices, teaching approaches and teacher development, and suggests innovations in these areas for enhancing pupil competence development in the context of Hong Kong senior secondary education. © 2010 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the findings from research using the critical incident technique to identify the use of key competencies for communication management practitioners. Qualitative data was generated from 202 critical incidents reported by 710 respondents. We also present a brief summary of the quantitative data, which identified two superordinate goals, six major competencies and four main personal attributes required for competent practice. Our primary focus in this paper, however, is on the holistic, practitioner-orientated descriptions and interpretations of workplace events, which illustrated how associated competencies and aptitudes are strategically applied in communication management. We identified further dimensions of competency development, such as reflective practice and transformative action as knowledge was constructed and reconfigured in the dynamic workplace environment. © 2010 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.

AB  - This paper outlines a study investigating the impact of the use of learning objects on the development of two key competencies from the revised New Zealand Curriculum Framework (Ministry of Education, 2007). It specifically focuses on the key competencies of 'thinking' and 'relating to others', and explores how teachers in an urban intermediate school (year 7 and 8) planned and integrated learning objects into a wider 'community' social studies topic, and the impact this integration had on student competency development. Outcomes from the study indicate that learning objects can, for some students, provide a motivating and engaging learning experience through which thinking capabilities and relationship skills can be enhanced, but that such development is dependent upon several factors including the design, content, and level of interactivity of the objects, how closely they align with learning goals, the careful selection of student groupings, and how access to the learning objects is organised and managed. The study also revealed some issues with the use of new digital data collection tools, particularly related to the accuracy of coding of visual information, and how to best translate this into text format for publication without 'diluting' its richness and meaning. © 2010.

AB  - As the business world becomes more complex, the role of professional higher education in the development of "reflective practitioners" becomes more cogent. In this article, the authors argue for the Bases of Competence model, which articulates base competencies required of today's higher education professional graduates, as a tool in learner-centered, self-reflective pedagogy and self-assessment. The purpose of this article is to describe the Bases of Competence model and to demonstrate its use in two learner-centered, self-reflective course-level initiatives. © The Author(s) 2011.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a synopsis of some major trends that have marked discussions on global learning for sustainable development (GLSD) in higher education. The aim is formulated against the background of the complexity represented in GLSD, as well as the fact that sustainable development (SD) is an issue of global interest for universities. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted an overview in recent trends in research on GLSD in higher education over the last 20 years, based on the combination of the keyword higher education for Sustainable Development with global learning (GL) and global education. Findings: The overview suggests that only relatively limited steps have been implemented to achieve GLSD, and rhetoric still dominates the discussions. It appears that little empirical research has been undertaken on learning in global settings. Several authors have identified the need for a competence-based curriculum for GLSD. Originality/value: Universities, professionals and students need to take greater responsibility. How knowledge, values and abilities are formed and developed from the global learner's perspective therefore, remains an open and fundamental question. The paper underlines the crucial role that higher education plays in GL for sustainability. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Introduction: Competence based education is becoming more important in dentistry and medicine. In dentistry clinical skills are assessed using longitudinal assessments or structured objective clinical tests. We have previously presented the assessment of competence in surgical extractions however the success rate for this was poor. The opportunity to alter staffing levels and timetabling arose and we present the influence of this on the achievement of competence. Methods: The competence assessments and portfolios of two consecutive years of dental undergraduates were examined after completing their surgical extraction course. The first cohort received 9 sessions of teaching spread over 2 years with one staff supervisor per session. The second cohort received 10 sessions with varying numbers of staff supervisors. Results: The first cohort required 210 staff sessions and performed 275 surgical extractions (mean 4), and 23% achieved competence. The second cohort required 240 staff sessions and performed 403 surgical extractions (mean 6), and 66% achieved competence. Thirty six extra sessions were provided for students in the second cohort who failed to complete their competence during the allocated blocks and following this 99% of the second cohort achieved competence. These differences are significant (P < 0.01). Conclusion: It is possible to demonstrate competence in large numbers of undergraduates in surgical extraction. The process can be influenced by staffing and timetabling changes which focus student experience and learning. © 2009 Blackwell Munksgaard.

AB  - This article analyses the dilemmas and practical tensions in implementing competence-based vocational education. Eleven case studies were conducted, including observation of lessons and interviews with teachers and students. The results show that schools meet various fundamental issues in realising this approach. A crucial question is how to stimulate the acquisition and use of a way of knowing and thinking that is based on vocational theory. Reflection, authenticity and coaching are relevant characteristics that are hardly put into practice yet. To understand these results the article reflects on factors that account for the distance between promising concepts and actual teaching practice. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The UK must further future European integration in legal education. This is important so that the UK remains competitive in the European market and continues to successfully ensure its students' employability beyond national boundaries. The paper argues that this can be done effectively through internationalising degrees by integrating an international dimension. Globalisation confronts the current as well as the future employment market with new challenges, from an economic as well as a social point of view: companies are operating internationally across Europe, and business, knowledge transfer as well as social interaction has long spread across territorial boundaries. Graduates will need a wider range of key competences to adapt to this rapidly changing and highly interconnected world. Dual legal qualification programmes must be enhanced because they have a key role to play in addressing both the social and economic aspects, by ensuring that students on these programmes acquire the key competencies needed to adapt flexibly to these changes, such as the competency in two legal systems, fluency in two languages, enhanced social and civic competencies, initiative and entrepreneurship, enhanced problem solving, constructive management and cultural awareness. Dual qualification programmes in the UK are producing some of the most sought after graduates in the discipline of law in the UK, and indeed the rest of Europe. It is in the interests of prospective and current students on such programmes, the universities that provide them, as well as the wider legal community in the UK and in the rest of Europe, that these programmes should be not only preserved, but enhanced. Unfortunately, too few such programmes are available. Specifically studying law in the UK and the legal system of another country and achieving an additional qualification besides an LLB, on a law programme based in the UK is a rarity. This is certainly not what one would expect with a view to policy developments at European level, which promote mobility programmes and joint degrees and feature a commitment to making Europe a competitive and knowledge-based economy with excellence in education. The paper analyses why there are so few such programmes in the UK, and proposes actions to meet the challenges and provide the UK with tools to further European integration in legal education. © 2009, 2009 The Association of Law Teachers.

AB  - Recent developments in competence-based education have motivated institutions of vocational education and training (VET) to improve the links or connectivity between learning in school and learning in the workplace, which has been a problem for decades. In previous research, a theoretical framework describing the underlying aspects of competence-based education was developed. In this study, three aspects of this framework were used to analyse connectivity between learning in school and learning in the workplace. These aspects were: i) authenticity, ii) selfresponsibility, and iii) the role of the teacher as expert and coach. Three stakeholder groups (i. e., students, teachers, and workplace training supervisors) involved in secondary VET programs in the field of life sciences in the Netherlands were questioned on these aspects. Based on their interviews, it is concluded that these aspects provide information about the process of connectivity. Because stakeholder groups hold different conceptions of workplace learning and often do not communicate adequately about mutual responsibilities, the implementation of these aspects of competence-based education has not significantly improved the connectivity situation. Nevertheless, these aspects of competence-based education can guide stakeholder groups in making clearer agreements about mutual responsibilities, which may improve connectivity in the future. © 2009 The Author(s).

AB  - Teamwork and problem-solving skills have frequently been identified by business leaders as being key competencies; thus, teaching methods such as problem-based learning and team-based learning have been developed. However, the focus of these methods has been on teaching one skill or the other. A key argument for teaching the skills concurrently is that the ability to solve an unstructured real-world problem within teams is what is needed outside the classroom and that this requires the use of both sets of skills simultaneously. Thus, the authors describe the design and implementation of a group problem-solving skills course for undergraduates, in which they engage in real creative problem-solving work together over a semester while learning and developing skills appropriate to their current stages in the team development and problem-solving processes. This method offers the potential to address criticisms by business leaders that new graduates often are technically proficient yet ill prepared to solve everyday organizational problems. © 2008 Organizational Behavior Teaching Society.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop recommendations for measures assessing intercultural training needs for international human resource management. Based on scientific as well as application-oriented criteria the aim is to select six measures assessing general intercultural competencies and with the help of behaviour ratings in interactive intercultural exercises to evaluate the psychometric quality and practicability of the questionnaires for training purposes. Design/methodology/approach: Psychometric quality including prognostic power of ICSI, FLCS, NVCCS, ISAS, TIHK, and SIB was tested by correlating subjects' questionnaires results with observations of their actual behaviour in intercultural exercises. Findings: Satisfying psychometric quality and prognostic validity of almost all measures was found. Especially TIHK, ICSI, and FLCS score well for assessing training needs whereas the results for SIB were problematic. Research limitations/implications: The study observed student participants of the same culture. Replication studies should examine large samples of different cultural backgrounds and manager populations. Practical implications: Human resource managers may benefit from gaining knowledge about which measures to use for identifying employee's weaknesses in intercultural competence in order to create tailor-made training interventions. Originality/value: The study is the first providing information about the psychometric quality, including predictive power, of six measures, that assess intercultural skills to detect intercultural training needs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Communicative-linguistic language competence is an intrinsic part of an individual's communicative competence and thus it is closely connected with basic competencies (key competences for lifelong learning). Due to its transversal nature, the linguistic competence is fundamental in all subjects of compulsory education. The importance of analyzing objective and subjective learning needs is related to designing a task-centered curriculum as a means to acquire a range of linguistic abilities. Both the learning needs embodied in official documents issued in Europe and Spain, and the needs perceived or expressed by people involved in the competence based teaching/learning process are an essential part of the components of educational tasks. Our proposal consists in considering tasks as problem situations which students should solve by applying, or putting into practice, the knowledge acquired in the different areas. The conception of an integrated curriculum that is common to all subjects will be always present in the communicative linguistic competence, since it plays a key role in the integral development of basic competences.

AB  - Background: With 15-30% met need for comprehensive emergency obstetrical care (CEmOC) and a 3% caesarean section rate, Tanzania needs to expand the number of facilities providing these services in more remote areas. Considering severe shortage of human resources for health in the country, currently operating at 32% of the required skilled workforce, an intensive three-month course was developed to train non-physician clinicians for remote health centres.Methods: Competency-based curricula for assistant medical officers' (AMOs) training in CEmOC, and for nurses, midwives and clinical officers in anaesthesia and operation theatre etiquette were developed and implemented in Ifakara, Tanzania. The required key competencies were identified, taught and objectively assessed. The training involved hands-on sessions, lectures and discussions. Participants were purposely selected in teams from remote health centres where CEmOC services were planned. Monthly supportive supervision after graduation was carried out in the upgraded health centres. Results: A total of 43 care providers from 12 health centres located in 11 rural districts in Tanzania and 2 from Somalia were trained from June 2009 to April 2010. Of these 14 were AMOs trained in CEmOC and 31 nurse-midwives and clinical officers trained in anaesthesia. During training, participants performed 278 major obstetric surgeries, 141 manual removal of placenta and evacuation of incomplete and septic abortions, and 1161 anaesthetic procedures under supervision. The first 8 months after introduction of CEmOC services in 3 health centres resulted in 179 caesarean sections, a remarkable increase of institutional deliveries by up to 300%, decreased fresh stillbirth rate (OR: 0.4; 95% CI: 0.1-1.7) and reduced obstetric referrals (OR: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1-0.4)). There were two maternal deaths, both arriving in a moribund condition.Conclusions: Tanzanian AMOs, clinical officers, and nurse-midwives can be trained as a team, in a three-month course, to provide effective CEmOC and anaesthesia in remote health centres. © 2011 Nyamtema et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this article is to empirically clarify factors and conditions of expertise. In addition to the core concept of expertise as excellence, a second factor needs to be taken into account: professionalism, or professional engagement. This hypothesis was tested and confirmed using data obtained from a survey on Swiss environmental professionals (n = 3514). The empirical test was based on factor analyses (Study 1) and a structural equation model (Study 2). The expertise scale consisted of nine items for self-assessed perceived expertise amongst professional peers (α =.78). Excellence turned out to be a logarithmic function of years of practice (Study 3). Professionalism prevailed in domains where standards for best practices still needed to be established (Study 4). © 2009 European Council for High Ability.

AB  - Objective: To develop generic criteria for the global assessment of clinical procedural competence and to quantify the extent to which existing checklists allow for holistic assessment of procedural competencies. Methods: We carried out a systematic review and qualitative analysis of published clinical procedural skills assessment checklists and enumerated the contents of each. Source materials included all English-language papers published from 1990 to June 2005, identified from 18 databases, which described or referred to an assessment document for any clinical procedural skill. A pair of reviewers identified key generic themes and sub-themes through in-depth analysis of a subset of 20 checklists with iterative agreement and independent retesting of a coding framework. The resulting framework was independently applied to all checklists by pairs of reviewers checking for the emergence of new themes and sub-themes. Main outcome measures were identification of generic clinical procedural skills and the frequency of occurrence of each in the identified checklists. Results: We identified 7 themes ('Procedural competence', represented in 85 [97%] checklists; 'Preparation', 65 [74%]; 'Safety', 45 [51%]; 'Communication and working with the patient', 32 [36%]; 'Infection control', 28 [32%]; 'Post-procedural care', 24 [27%]; 'Team working', 13 [15%]) and 37 sub-themes, which encapsulated all identified checklists. Of the sub-themes, 2 were identified after the initial coding framework had been finalised. Conclusions: It is possible to develop generic criteria for the global assessment of clinical procedural skills. A third and a half of checklists, respectively, do not enable explicit assessment of the key competencies 'Infection control' and 'Safety'. Their assessment may be inconsistent in assessments which use such checklists. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

AB  - The authors describe how social work students on placement at the Realife Trust Student Unit have been able to explore the potential of support brokerage to promote self-directed support by disabled people and family carers. The students complete brokerage training as part of the placement and are required to compare and contrast the key competencies required by the General Social Care Council with the knowledge base and job description of support brokers defined by the National Brokerage Network in the UK. Lead author, Tony Phillips argues that brokerage provides an opportunity for the social work profession to return to its practitioner roots and reject the aberrations of the care management model as having little or no relevance to the development of a social care system based on the policy of personalisation. Three social work students from three different cohorts of the unit provide their own first-hand accounts of the challenges involved and insights gained. © 2010 GAPS.

AB  - In translating the concept of sustainable development into science and education, a number of fundamental barriers and practical obstacles have to be taken into account. However, there are also interesting opportunities and attractive challenges to make sustainable development "researchable, teachable, and learnable." New paradigms, or at least a shift in dominant paradigms, are required. Transition of the old curricula into more "sustainability-oriented curricula" means that the limited mono- and multidisciplinary approaches need to be replaced by full multi- and interdisciplinarity. This educational transition, which took place in several Dutch universities in the past two decades, and shifts in paradigm changed the educational system, which is now based on ideas from problem-based learning, project education, internationalization, multi- and interdisciplinarity, and competence-based education. © 2010 by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Objective: This study developed and validated a virtual reality (VR) simulator for use by interventional radiologists.Background: Research in the area of skill acquisition reports practice as essential to become a task expert. Studies on simulation show skills learned in VR can be successfully transferred to a real-world task. Recently, with improvements in technology, VR simulators have been developed to allow complex medical procedures to be practiced without risking the patient.Method: Three studies are reported. In Study 1, 35 consultant interventional radiologists took part in a cognitive task analysis to empirically establish the key competencies of the Seldinger procedure. In Study 2, 62 participants performed one simulated procedure, and their performance was compared by expertise. In Study 3, the transferability of simulator training to a real-world procedure was assessed with 14 trainees.Results: Study 1 produced 23 key competencies that were implemented as performance measures in the simulator. Study 2 showed the simulator had both face and construct validity, although some issues were identified. Study 3 showed the group that had undergone simulator training received significantly higher mean performance ratings on a subsequent patient procedure.Conclusion: The findings of this study support the centrality of validation in the successful design of simulators and show the utility of simulators as a training device.Application: The studies show the key elements of a validation program for a simulator. In addition to task analysis and face and construct validities, the authors highlight the importance of transfer of training in validation studies. © 2011 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

AB  - Background. Much research has been devoted to identifying healthcare needs in a climate-changing world. However, while there are now global and national policy statements about the importance of health workforce development for climate change, little has been published about what competencies might be demanded of practitioners in a climate-changing world. In such a context, this debate and discussion paper aims to explore the nature of key competencies and related opportunities for teaching climate change in medical education and training. Particular emphasis is made on preparation for practice in rural and remote regions likely to be greatly affected by climate change. Discussion. The paper describes what kinds of competencies for climate change might be included in medical education and training. It explores which curricula, teaching, learning and assessment approaches might be involved. Rather than arguing for major changes to medical education and training, this paper explores well established precedents to offer practical suggestions for where a particular kind of literacy - eco-medical literacy - and related competencies could be naturally integrated into existing elements of medical education and training. Summary. The health effects of climate change have, generally, not yet been integrated into medical education and training systems. However, the necessary competencies could be taught by building on existing models, best practice and innovative traditions in medicine. Even in crowded curricula, climate change offers an opportunity to reinforce and extend understandings of how interactions between people and place affect health. © 2010 Bell; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - What are the "key competencies" needed in our time? What literacy is needed to make students active participants in their societies and contributors to changing cultures? This article offers a contribution to the ongoing discussion about these questions. It takes as its point of departure the "key competencies" formulated in the OECD program Definition and Selection of Competencies (DeSeCo) in response to educational challenges in a changing world, and the five "basic skills" to be developed in all school subjects from year 1 to year 13 in the Norwegian curriculum of 2006 (LK06). It argues, first, for the need to understand "basic skills" in the perspective of DeSeCo "key competencies", with a focus, as formulated in DeSeCo, on using tools interactively, acting autonomously, and interacting in heterogeneous groups. Secondly, the aims and purposes of the school subject "Norwegian" in Norway, as formulated in LK06, are discussed in relation to the aims of the DeSeCo key competencies and the concepts of critical literacy and Bildung. Thirdly, the article offers a discussion of how standard language education can become a site for the development of key competencies and critical literacies, drawing on Mikhail Bakhtin's ideas about utterances and voices and Roz Ivanic's about discoursal identities, and talking about the StLE subject as a potential public space, a stage, a resonance room, and a cultural workshop. Finally, some concluding remarks are made about the crucial role of the teacher in such a curriculum, and about the role of standard language education in relation to other school subjects. © 2011 Copyright Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research.

AB  - Undergraduate medical education in Sweden has moved from nationally regulated, subject-based courses to programmes integrated either around organ systems or physiological and patho-physiological processes, or organised around basic medical science in conjunction with clinical specialities, with individual profiles at the seven medical schools. The national regulations are restricted to overall academic and professional outcomes. The 5 year long university undergraduate curriculum is followed by a mandatory 18 months internship, delivered by the County Councils. While quality control and accreditation for the university curriculum is provided by the Swedish National Agency for Higher Education, no such formal control exists for the internship; undergraduate medical education is therefore in conflict with EU directives from 2005. The Government is expected to move towards 6 years long university undergraduate programmes, leading to licence, which will facilitate international mobility of both Swedish and foreign medical students and doctors. Ongoing academic development of undergraduate education is strengthened by the Bologna process. It includes outcome (competence)-based curricula, university Masters level complying with international standards, progression of competence throughout the curriculum, student directed learning, active participation and roles in practical clinical education and a national assessment model to assure professional competence. In the near future, the dimensioning of Swedish undergraduate education is likely to be decided more by international demands and aspects of quality than by national demands for doctors. © 2011 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper analyzes the idea of higher education, its transformation into an ICT influenced, competence-based pragmatic university idea. For the analysis of developed competences in the contemporary university the groups of Informatics and Mathematics students are chosen. These academic groups are presumably most prepared for the university change and should promote further development and implementation of information technologies. The theoretical analysis of university models, the pragmatic idea of the contemporary higher education are based on the philosophy of postmodernism. The main factors influencing the contemporary higher education as well as the impact of ICT on the universities and the nature of work are also analyzed. The empirical study presents data and finding of the research about the competences to be developed in master study programs (physical sciences) and Vilnius University Informatics and Mathematics students' opinion on university studies, the developed competences and changes in Lithuanian higher education.

AB  - A characteristic feature of many contemporary international administrations of post-conflict territories has been the reluctance of the administrating body to rescind its competences. International administrations have legitimatised their maintenance of key competences on the basis that the societies they administer have yet to achieve stipulated benchmarks indicative of a capacity for complete self-government. This paper offers a post-structuralist analysis of the unwillingness of international administrations to cede control to local institutions and draws in particular on Jean Baudrillard's theory of hyperreality. Baudrillard identified the means by which, as part of a process of selfidentification, a simulated world has come to replace reality and our perception of things has become corrupted by a perception of a reality that never existed. Thus entities and phenomena are imbued with characteristics they do not and cannot have, yet are treated as though they do. In the context of statebuilding this has been manifest in the desire to create political communities which mirror an idealised and unreal vision of the Western state. © 2011 Southseries Inc.

AB  - This article presents research which aims to evaluate the validity of two teaching proposals for translator training in a blended learning mode: Introduction to translation and Technical-scientific translation. Details are given of the teaching theory from which the design of the proposals is drawn (competence-based training and task based approach), of the concept of blended learning, and of the tools that might be used. Next, the methodology employed to conduct the research and the selection process for the teaching units under investigation is presented. Finally, the research phases are described (pilot study and experiment), along with the data collection instruments, data analysis and results obtained. The validity of the teaching proposal and the multiple advantages of blended learning are established by the research: it permits timetable flexibility and the freedom to organize the workload, it encourages group work and promotes student autonomy and responsibility. © St. Jerome Publishing.

AB  - Competence-based education is becoming increasingly popular. Competencies are used more and more as the starting point for designing curricula and instructional methods, especially in vocational education and training, to realize authentic and self-steering study programmes. Despite its popularity in both research and educational settings, there is no shared understanding of what competence-based education should look like. Earlier work developed a model for competence-based education that outlines eight features that are important for competence-based education. This paper presents a study designed to determine the extent to which the model for competence-based education can be understood and perceived as useful by teachers in vocational education and training in the Netherlands. The study included 12 teams of teachers in the process of designing or re-designing their study programmes to be more competence-based. Teachers reported that the instrument helped them understand the state of affairs of their study programmes, and empowered them to make decisions about the extent to which they want to make these programmes more competence-based. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Purpose – Academic sustainability programs aim to develop key competencies in sustainability, including problemsolving skills and the ability to collaborate successfully with experts and stakeholders. These key competencies may be most fully developed in new teaching and learning situations. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the kind of, and extent to which, these key competencies can be acquired in realworld learning opportunities. Design/methodology/approach – The paper summarizes key competencies in sustainability, identifies criteria for realworld learning opportunities in sustainability programs, and draws on dominant realworld learning models including project and problembased learning, service learning, and internships in communities, businesses, and governments. These components are integrated into a framework to design realworld learning opportunities. Findings – A “functional and progressive” model of realworld learning opportunities seems most conducive to introduce students (as well as faculty and community partners) to collaborative research between academic researchers and practitioners. The stepwise process combined with additional principles allows building competencies such as problem solving, linking knowledge to action, and collaborative work, while applying concepts and methods from the field of sustainability. Practical implications – The paper offers examples of realworld learning opportunities at the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University, discusses general challenges of implementation and organizational learning, and draws attention to critical success factors such as collaborative design, coordination, and integration in general introductory courses for undergraduate students. Originality/value – The paper contributes to sustainability education by clarifying how realworld learning opportunities contribute to the acquisition of key competencies in sustainability. It proposes a functional and progressive model to be integrated into the (undergraduate) curriculum and suggests strategies for its implementation. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - Evidence suggests that experienced instructional designers often use heuristics and adapted models when engaged in the instructional design problem-solving process. This study used the Delphi technique to identify a core set of heuristics designers reported as being important to the success of the design process. The overarching purpose of the study was: (1) to examine and describe the heuristics that guided instructional designers' practice and (2) to identify the relationship between these heuristics and key competencies of the discipline, as outlined by the International Board of Standards for Training, Performance, and Instruction. Sixty-one heuristics were ultimately identified (reached consensus). All 61 aligned with at least one of the four categories of IBSTPI, with some aligning with more than one. More specifically, 17 heuristics aligned with Professional Foundations competencies, 17 aligned with Planning and Analysis competencies, 18 aligned with Design and Development competencies and 10 aligned with Implementation and Management competencies. By examining instructional design heuristics, we hope to better understand the potential genesis and/or future application of each heuristic. Results provide insights into the specific heuristics experienced designers perceive as being effective during the ID process. © 2011 Association for Educational Communications and Technology.

AB  - Aims: To investigate trends in the evaluation of clinical competence in nursing students and newly qualified nurses over the last 10 years. Design: A literature review following PRISMA guidelines. Methods: The following databases were searched: Cochrane, Medline and CINAHL using the terms competenc*, nurs*and assess*, evaluat*, measure*, from January 2001-March 2010. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Results: Twenty three papers were included and these mainly considered the following topics: instrument development and testing; approaches to testing competence; assessment and related factors. A holistic concept of competence is gaining popularity, and consensus around definitions is emerging. Some methods and instruments to measure competence are under systematic development and testing for reliability and validity with large samples and rigorous statistical method. Wider national and international cooperation is evident in competence-based assessment. Conclusions: Competence-based education is evident, but this does not mean that issues related to competence definition have been resolved. Larger and more international cooperation is required to reach common agreement and validity in competence-based education and assessment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study aims to determine the level of prospective teachers in terms of lifelong learning key competences. Lifelong learning is an extensive educational approach receiving much attention not only by educational politics of European Union but also by the rest of the world. Lifelong learning competence requires an active and constant usage of knowledge. The items of "The Scale of Key Competences for Lifelong Learning" (SKCLLL) have been developed by the researchers based on the literature and the views of educational experts. Twenty-three items were defined in the scale. The scale has been applied to 415 prospective teachers attending to the final grade of the Faculty of Education of Selcuk University in Konya, Turkey. Based on the analysis carried out, it has been found that gender is not an effective factor in terms of the prospective teachers' lifelong learning key competences. No significant difference has been found in terms of the sub-branches. The field where prospective teachers feel that they are the least competent is communication in native language. © 2010 Academic Journals.

AB  - Industry has consistently identified lack of experience in manufacturing processes as one of the key competency gaps among new engineering graduates. This paper discusses a laboratory-based course that provides realistic hands-on manufacturing experiences to students. The course uses team-based projects that help students gain hands-on experience with selected manufacturing processes. The projects start with simple components that can be made on a single machine such as a lathe or a mill, and progress to the manufacture and assembly of a fully functional mechanism. This approach introduces students to the issues involved in putting together a non-trivial assembly. Multiple evaluation tools including focus groups, surveys, and actual observations, were used to assess the effectiveness of the approach used. The results indicate that this is indeed an effective way of addressing industry concerns.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate whether the new (comprehensive) concept of competence and the competence-based education approach are being used in, and perceived as being fruitful for, academic education. Design/methodology/approach - In this explorative and qualitative study individual interviews with representatives of study programs from eight universities in the Netherlands were held, and a participative case-study in one university was conducted, in which practices and perceptions from various stakeholder groups were triangulated. Findings - The opinions of the respondents on the usefulness of the competence-based education approach were quite positive. There is wide agreement on the necessity to align university curricula to the needs of society and of the labour market. University education can make effective use of the competence concept. Universities differ as to the extent to which they employ a competence-based education approach. Many hurdles exist for actually implementing this in university curricula. Research limitations/implications - Interpretations largely depend on the perceptions of the respondents in the study. For most university programs only one representative was included as respondent in the study. Practical implications - With some exceptions, the competence-based education approach is currently not much used in academic education. Possibilities and limitations of competence-based academic education should be identified in further case studies and strategies for actually implementing it should be developed. Further research should show differential relationships between the level of integration of the competence concept in higher education and the societal effects of the respective programs. Originality/value - The competence concept has been underexposed in university education practices and in research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Adaptability is a key competency for career success. In this article, the authors examine how individual adaptability is associated with the accrual of human capital, the organization of the work environment, and the characteristics of individuals. They find that a number of factors are particularly strongly related to personal adaptability: gender, employability, education, and management support. By understanding the variety of factors that are intrinsic to individuals, those that can be developed within individuals, and work environment design, it seems possible to foster the development of personal adaptability in the workplace. © 2008 Baker College.

AB  - Recent literature on the role of the interactive whiteboard (IWB) has indicated numerous ways in which teachers make use of the IWB to support children's learning. In these studies there is a growing awareness of changing roles in the classroom as teachers gain confidence in the use of new technologies. This study describes how a researcher worked with a teacher in a small rural school in New Zealand to document and understand the use of an IWB to enhance the learning of young children ages five to six years. The focus of the research was on how the features of the IWB supported teaching actions and provided potential and structure for the children to develop their 'key competencies', broadly conceptualised as the development of knowledge, skills and aptitudes for learning. Here the authors demonstrate that it was the teacher's orchestration of the classroom environment, incorporating the use of the IWB, that was the key to the development of pupil autonomy as they learnt to take risks and to be creative in their learning with the interactive whiteboard. © 2010 Association for Information Technology in Teacher Education.

AB  - In the debate about economic globalisation, governance has become a central element. Especially studies working with a value chain concept emphasise the ability to direct and to control different economic actors at different geographical places in a globally-linked production process as a key competency for market success. But most of these studies focus on the industrial or agricultural sector. The value chain discussion drew only little attention to the phenomenon of international tourism, although it is one of the most important economic branches worldwide. And in tourism too, we find globally-linked value chains. So the question arises, of how far experiences and findings made within the various value chain studies undertaken so far may help us to gain insight into the governance structures and organisational patterns in the international tourism business. This article deals with the situation of the Moroccan mountain tourism as one example of internationally linked tourism. Based on the Global Commodity Chain concept by Gary Gereffi, it describes the different types of organisation and governance in this tourism chain and argues that the Commodity Chain concept represents a useful starting point for the analysis of tourism. However, because of the particularities in tourism, it is not able to explain all the existing forms of business relations. Referring to transaction cost theory it will seek to fill this gap and therefore contribute to a general understanding about how value chains in tourism are organised and governed. Finally, it will explain not only why, but also when different types of governance and organisation do prevail by integrating them into a life cycle model of tourism destinations.

AB  - This article describes a method for human capital scenario analysis, one that may be used as an organizational intelligence (OI) tool capable of supporting management decision-making. Here, scenario analysis supports a knowledge management based (KM-based) decisional method for integrating human resource (HR) and fiscal data in performance measurement. This OI scenario analysis tool may be used in strategic management, organizational development, performance measurement, and HR-related risk mitigation. The aim is to strengthen decisional capacity with regard to the management of human capital and in general with regard to the advancement of organizational performance and productivity goals. The approach taken is that of human capital scenario analysis using system dynamics methods. Scenario analysis equations are developed on the basis of empirically-grounded research that has been conducted for several years at private companies and municipal organizations in Finland. The scenario analysis (SA) tool successfully integrates organization-level human resource knowledge management with business scorecards, thereby assisting management decision-making. Through their use of the SA tool, managers can advance organizational learning and improve strategic decision-making. Human resource and organizational competencies are considered together, so that managers may consider key factors affecting future performance comprehensively, in their long-range decision-making. The SA model was developed during a period of steady economic growth in Finland. While the model was created using the most germane literature and empirically grounded research, contextual factors such as relative economic prosperity may limit generalizability to other contexts. The article describes how human resource metrics and competencies may inform performance measures, in particular business scorecards. The development of key competencies improves organizational performance and performance outcomes. As suggested by game theory, and by models of tacit communications, organizational competencies can be developed and performance outcomes enhanced by using "tacit signals" that are conducive to the realization of desired scenarios. © Marko Kesti, Antti Syväjärvi, Jari Stenvall, Mario Rivera, 2011.

AB  - Research evidence shows that a career dialogue is a central part of any powerful learning environment for career learning. In vocational education and training, there are three important parties in this dialogue: the student, the teacher and the mentor from practice. In this paper the communication between these parties is investigated in secondary vocational training in the Netherlands. Results suggest that the potential of the dialogue (or trialogue, as it concerns three parties) is hardly utilised: the communication between student, teacher and mentor from practice is not dialogical and only discusses the most successful way to a degree, but not to a career. © 2009 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.

AB  - Purpose- The purpose of this paper is to outline strategies and approaches in the workforce plan to address skill shortages in the university of Melbourne library to ensure that staff have the appropriate skills for the future. Design/methodology/approach- The objectives were achieved by developing a workforce plan to identify skills gaps, and then to work with training providers to develop a training plan. There was collaboration with two TAFE colleges to deliver accredited courses to staff to develop the skills required, ensuring key competencies were achieved and the staff received accreditation for their learning Findings- The workforce plan showed an aging workforce but also skill shortages across the library. If the library was to be able to deliver services to meet the needs of future students then it needed to develop training programs to enable staff to develop the appropriate skill sets required to meet the needs of the library in the future. A brief survey of participants of the course discovered staff found the course very useful, although not all staff were able to utilize their new skills as effectively as they might in their current roles. This showed a need to review and re-write position descriptions for staff. Practical implications- The outcomes and implications for the future are to ensure there is: an ongoing staff development and training program in place for staff to enable them to continually update their skills as required to meet the needs of the library; that staff have opportunities to utilize the new skills they have acquired to improve and deliver library services; and that staff have the appropriate time to learn and develop themselves Originality/value- The paper shows that some of the key competencies required by staff are not always learnt in the workplace, or in universities, but can be delivered by vocational training providers such as a TAFE college. The idea of working with TAFE teachers to develop and adapt a training program is quite a different approach to solving this skill gap problem. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to increase understanding of the relationships among the workplace as a learning environment, strategies for competence development used by SMEs and learning outcomes. Specifically, there is a focus on a distinction between formal and integrated strategies for competence development, the conditions under which these strategies are likely to be used, and their effects in terms of individual learning outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: The study was based mainly on questionnaire data collected through a survey of 14 SMEs that had received support from the European Social Fund's Objective 3 programme. In addition, data collected through interviews and analyses of documents were used. Findings: The results indicate interactions between the strategy of competence development used by the firms (formal vs integrated) and the type of learning environment in the workplace (constraining vs enabling). The use of an integrated strategy in an enabling learning environment was the most successful combination in terms of learning outcomes, while the use of an integrated strategy in a constraining learning environment was the least successful combination. Research limitations/implications: There is a need to elaborate the theoretical and empirical basis of the distinction between formal and integrated strategies for competence development, and to study the effects of the two types of strategy, not only for individual learning outcomes, but also for effects at an organisational level. Practical implications: HRD practitioners need to question a traditional reliance on formal training, as the presented results indicate the importance of using competence development strategies that are based on an integration of formal and informal learning. Originality/value: The study indicates that the effects of competence development efforts are likely to be a function not only, nor primarily, of the training methods and strategies that are used, but also of the characteristics of the learning environment of the workplace. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - In 2001 the Chinese government initiated school curriculum reforms, which focus on educational philosophy, curriculum structures, teaching and learning methods, and assessment. The aim of this reform project was to help develop competence-based education in contrast to the long-time dominating academic-focused education in basic schooling. This project set higher standards on teachers, whose understanding and attitudes towards the reforms as well as their competence in teaching the new curriculum are crucial for the outcomes. Two authors of this paper conducted a survey to over 9000 primary school teachers in Beijing, sponsored by Beijing Municipal Commission of Education. This paper attempts to analyse the survey data in the aspects of teachers' understanding of the new curriculum, their attitudes to the new curriculum, and their views on the prospects of the new curriculum. The authors will discuss the current situation of school education in China and highlight problems for the reforms. © Common Ground, Ning Zhang, Rong Cui, Baoying Gao.

AB  - Research has shown that computer games and simulations can support learning in a number of different areas, ranging from motor skills to decision-making and problem-solving. In this study, the electronic life simulation "RealLives" was introduced to middle schools in Australia, the USA and Switzerland to promote students' intercultural competence. In times of globalisation, intercultural competence can be considered a key competence and its promotion should be part of children's education. Computer games and simulations offer innovative ways in which this can be done. This paper presents selected results from the "RealLives" study, focusing on students' perceptions of learning with the simulation in school. It looks at different aspects, such as interestingness, fun, enjoyment and engagement with the simulation, as well as educational outcomes. The findings support results of previous studies that learning with an electronic simulation is generally considered fun and engaging, although excitement can decrease over time. They also show that students can expand their knowledge, deepen their understanding and make valuable experiences in a variety of areas by using a simulation like "RealLives". Comparable to outcomes of previous studies, the findings suggest that learning with such a medium requires guidance and support by a teacher to ensure accurate, relevant and adequate educational outcomes. © Common Ground, Anika Struppert.

AB  - Constant changes in society and the public health domain force public health professionals into new roles and the development of new competencies. Public health professionals will need to be trained to respond to this challenge. The aim of this comparative study among Poland, the UK and the Netherlands is to identify competence needs for Master of Public Health graduates entering the labour market from a European perspective. A self-administered questionnaire was sent to employers in the three countries, rating the importance of competency in public health on a master's level. In all three countries, interpersonal competencies, like team working and communication skills, are rated as highly important. However, employers in the UK and Poland generally rate public health specific competencies as much more important than their Dutch colleagues. It is concluded that while public health specific knowledge is providing a useful starting point for entry-level public health professionals, employers increasingly recognise the value of generic competencies such as communication and team working skills. The results suggest a stronger emphasis on teaching methods that encourage active learning and the integration of skills, which is crucial for enhancing graduates' employability, and foster an open attitude to multidisciplinary working, which is essential in modern health care. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - The concept of competence is a recent introduction into the curricula of the Spanish education system, and applies to vocational training and university, but also to basic education. In both cases, the meaning and use of the term have differed, sometimes giving rise to confusion. There can be no doubt, however, that this incorporation has been of significant impact. On the one hand, it has generated considerable debate between those who consider the concept to respond to economistic arguments, removed from educational realities, and those who believe it to have a transformation potential that cannot be ignored. On the other, incorporation of the concept is leading to a series of modifications in school practices and in teaching and learning with whose consequences we are not yet acquainted. This article analyses the situation created by the introduction of key competences in Spanish compulsory education and seeks to gauge the potential this offers for improving opportunities for success at school. The authors believe that key competences are a reformulation of educational intentions, whose consequences for schools and teaching practices largely depend on the new interpretation of learning in the light of different approaches and research traditions. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Vocational education and training (VET) concerns the cultivation and development of specific skills and competencies, in addition to broad underpinning knowledge relating to paid employment. VET assessment is, therefore, designed to determine the extent to which a trainee has effectively acquired the knowledge, skills, and competencies required by employers. Across a range of occupations, such testing has traditionally comprised a portfolio of practical on-the-job assessments, oral tests and laboratory tasks. In recent years vocational training assessment has increasingly adopted new computer-based assessment (CBA) methods and, as a consequence, consideration of the scope of computer-based assessments and their appropriateness for vocational training evaluation is timely. This paper examines the growing adoption of CBA within the safety-critical field of maritime education and training (MET), particularly, in relation to the summative assessment of seafarers for licensing purposes. It discusses the implications for validity, reliability and security. © 2011 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.

AB  - Following the launch of Fiji’s public enterprise reform in 1993 that involved commercialisation and corporatisation to create solutions in the ailing government commercial companies (GCCs), not much improvement has been seen in recent times. Many questions were raised in an attempt to determine the cause of the problem. In return, a lot of explanations and answers were presented and the key competencies of senior managers in charge of GCCs were acknowledged amongst the myriad of issues raised. This study seeks to bring to the fore key competencies central to sound performance of GCCs according to senior managers of GCCs following the reform. This is based on several interviews and questionnaires conducted on senior managers of GCCs. The findings of this research are important for many reasons. In particular, it helps government officials identify and address the training needs of senior managers of GCCs. © Copyright 2011 Taylor and Francis Group LLC.

AB  - To strategically manage human capital in education means restructuring the entire human resource system so that schools not only recruit and retain smart and capable individuals, but also manage them in ways that support the strategic directions of the organization. These management practices must be aligned with a district's education improvement strategy, its view of effective instructional practice, and its goals for student achievement. The district needs to identify key staff who will carry out the improvement strategy, identify the key competencies they need to do the job, and develop strategies for acquiring, developing and retaining talented people.

AB  - A growing discourse about broadening the educational experience of physicians in medical education focuses on professional formation and the wider social context within which health care is delivered. This shift suggests a complex reconfiguration of medical education. Where does one begin this task? First, medical education reform must be grounded in a clarification of the conceptual terrain where proposed changes in pedagogy and practice are occurring. More specifically, some clarity is needed regarding the basic or key competencies that students are expected to acquire through educational processes. Accordingly, the author argues that having a clear and comprehensive conceptual understanding of the educational aims defining this reform is a necessary starting point. Although descriptions of competencies (such as those required by CanMeds and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education) focus on lists of skills, greater detail is needed regarding our understanding of the values and rationale underlying such skills if they are to be applied in educationally effective ways. The author shows the extent to which and ways in which our understanding of these basic concepts will influence the direction of reforms. He examines various conceptions of the role of communication in medicine and indicates various educational benefits and shortcomings in these approaches. He concludes by identifying one concept of communication, termed "communication as a medical-epistemic competency, " that can include and incorporate many facets of communication in the medical context while also responding to broader societal changes being addressed through post-Flexner developments in educational reform.

AB  - In this paper, the authors present the results of a study which delineated six key competencies of interprofessional collaborative practice for patient-centred care: communication; strength in one's professional role; knowledge of professional role of others; leadership; team function; and negotiation for conflict resolution. While all of these competencies are important and require special attention, this paper examines and discusses the competency knowledge of professional role of others and its associated behavioural indicators, especially as these relate to the interprofessional education of nursing students. The identification of these competencies and their behavioural indicators serve two purposes. It forms the basis for the preparation of students, preceptors, and faculty for interprofessional practice, and it develops a tool for assessing student performance in such practice. Consequently, we believe that the utilization of this key competency and its behavioural indicators will contribute to the development of programs that include specific knowledge and skills related to interprofessional nursing education. This will enable educators to support and evaluate students in interprofessional educational experiences more efficiently and effectively. Ultimately, as nursing students practice and become fully functioning practitioners, client care will be optimized. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The development of key competences for lifelong learning has been an important policy imperative for EU Member States. The European Reference Framework of key competences (2006) built on previous developments by the OECD, UNESCO and Member States themselves. It defined key competences as knowledge, skills and attitudes applied appropriately to contexts. Now most Member States have incorporated key competences, or similarly broad learning outcomes, into their school curriculum frameworks. This is a necessary but insufficient step towards implementation; for the effective development of learners' key competences, assessment must also change. This article focuses on the challenge of assessing cross-curricular key competences in primary and secondary education. It is based on a major study for the European Commission (Gordon, etal., 2009), which drew on information gathered and validated with the help of experts in each of the 27 EU Member States. The study's typology of assessment provides a basis for reviewing some recent developments in Member States. Present challenges and innovative responses are addressed, including 'unpacking' key competences, 'mapping' them to contexts and 'accessment' of their full scope and range. Policy developments are considered in the context of the author's work with the European Commission's Thematic Working Group on the assessment of key competences. The article concludes with considerations for policy and practice. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The GSAE has piloted (2006-2008) the national quality assurance & assessment framework (NQAF) following the general principles of the Common Quality Assurance Framework for VET in Europe (CQAF). According to the Greek framework each Adult Learning and Education Provider (ALEP) designs and implements self-evaluation procedures for its programs following national program evaluation standards and procedures. In addition, audit procedures carried out by external evaluators in all 13 regions of the country to ensure accountability and quality improvement. Finally, GSAE has been engaged in a discussion of developing a National Competency Framework (NCF) to assess learner achievements and performance. Overall six key competencies (i.e. organizational, technical, cultural, personal, civic, communicative) have been developed to assess prior learning as well as to validate the Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes adult learners acquire after completing an educational program. This paper will present the responce of the Greek Adult Educational System to the European quality assurance policies. © Common Ground, Konstantinos Tsamadias, Eugenia Arvanitis.

AB  - Neo-liberal discourse is described by many critical education researchers as almost the only discourse within European education policy making. However, although this discourse clearly exists and is powerful, the author identifies an alternative discourse within European Union policy making which incorporates narratives of social justice, solidarity and democracy, particularly citing education as a vehicle for these narratives. This article highlights the place of this alternative discourse in the policy process of the identification of key competences and the creation of indicators by which the competences can be evaluated. It uses official texts and direct experience of working in the European Commission's Centre for Research on Lifelong Learning (CRELL) to explain this narrative further, including the process of the development of indicators on certain key competences, such as civic competence and learning to learn and the social justice dialogue that forms the basis for these discussions. The article argues that the absence from critical educational researchers' debates of this narrative leads to an oversimplified understanding of European policy processes.

AB  - The paper considers alternative constructivism as a possibility of theoretical starting point regarding education as a factor of intercultural communication. The introductory part of the paper deals with Kelly's personal construct theory permeating the arguments in favour of the theoretical research thesis referring to the issue of the extent the pluralism of European culture space interferes with national culture through education. Furthermore, the paper considers the way pedagogy has been searching for more comprehensive self-observation, self-reflection and self-determination on its way to self-change in order to ensure freedom of personal action according to contemporary philosophical discussions. The importance of education as a factor of intercultural communication has been supported by the outcomes of an explorative empirical research, which is an element bonding all the reflections in the text. Finally, the key competences for intercultural communication have been stated in the paper.

AB  - In this article the authors establish the key competencies that should be acquired by future teachers in the course of their undergraduate studies. They also develop a model of the factors for which they presume most significantly contribute to the development of the selected competencies. For the selection of competencies and predictors of their development they adapted the model of the REFLEX Project (2009 -) in-line with relevant theories, projects and authors concerning the competencies of primary school teachers. In the empirical part, the authors, among others, prove as follows: (1) the grades of the future primary school teachers during study have only a very limited impact on the acquired competencies studied in the paper; (2) occupational values highly impact the development of all studied competencies; (3) greater inclusiveness of an individual in social networks has a positive impact and statistically significantly contributes to reaching all studied competencies. The authors agree that the future development of the curriculum for primary school teachers should seriously consider these findings.

AB  - The goal of this paper is to try to answer following questions: To what extent does mathematics teaching develop key competences of students? Are trends of student’s key competences development implemented in current education so that our school graduates stand the European competition? We searched for the answers in a survey and in this work we want to present the results of the study. In the introduction theoretical resources are described, the term ’key competences’ is defined and system of mathematical key competences is outlined. In the next part of this paper we follow the survey offering answers to asked questions. Goal of the survey is presented, hypotheses are set and applied methods are characterised. We deal with survey realisation and quantitative and qualitative evaluation and we introduce possible improvements. © 2008, Drustvo Matematicara Srbije. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of the article is to present and discuss a study in which Finnish, English and Swedish pupils' understanding of citizenship education with regard to: (a) political literacy; and (b) attitudes and values was explored. The study was a cross-national, multiple case study and data were collected through 18 focus group dialogues with 15-year-old pupils. Results showed that English pupils were much more well-informed about rights and responsibilities than their Nordic counterparts and also more skilled rhetorically, but appeared less accustomed to open and confident relationships with adults than the Swedish pupils. Finnish pupils did not seem to be encouraged to talk; instead they kept their thoughts and feelings to themselves. One conclusion, among others, was that the study illuminates conditions for the development of a so-called key competence - i.e., 'interpersonal, intercultural, social and civic competence'. © 2010 Association for Teacher Education in Europe.

AB  - Within the last few years in a number of countries, industrial groups have initiated research and studies that have attempted to identify skills that are desirable in new employees. In Australia, the set of key competencies that have been developed bear marked similarities with developments in other countries, also stimulated by concerns about economic productivity and competitiveness and the smooth and effective transition of young people into the workforce. Simultaneous with these developments in industry, technical education has undergone a dramatic resurgence in an attempt to focus on the optimal and unique contribution of this area of study to the development of an individual in preparation for life in a technological environment. The thesis of this paper is that such a confluence of goals is beneficial in many respects, but is limiting to technology education. Technology education as general education must go beyond the needs of industry for its goals, to some of the principles of a liberal education that are applicable to technology. This distinction is becoming more difficult to utilize as the lines between general and vocational education are becoming blurred. In some countries such as the USA they have always been fuzzy, but in general a convenient and appropriate categorization and hence description of technology education has been its classification as general education. As general education becomes vocationalized and vocational education becomes generalized, the rationales necessarily change.

AB  - This article traces key competences that are necessary to master as teachers are increasingly obliged to orchestrate learning as initiation into individual autonomy. The context is one that acknowledges that learning increasingly dissipates out into cyberspace.Inspired by Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault, the article explores preconditions for professionalizing the teacher using project work as a generalized case. Project work claims to anticipate initiation into autonomy and reflects new power relations between professionals and clients as well. It is assumed that project work illustrates the transition from traditional school forms to a more individualized society where Information and Communication Technologies media (ICT) are increasingly integrated in learning. It is likewise assumed that the procedures and rules governing project workas a way of shaping the image of oneself as an individualcorrespond in ambivalent ways to competences that one must master in order to navigate as an up-to-date employee, citizen, and parent, and so on.

AB  - This paper offers a strategy for the development of successful work‐based learning programmes within higher education. It identifies and addresses the key challenges facing such development. Firstly, whether it is possible to develop a work‐based learning programme which provides an effective learning experience at higher education level and which draws upon opportunities within the workplace. Secondly, whether work‐based learning programmes are an appropriate vehicle for structuring and accrediting the continuing development of the workforce. In addressing these challenges, we examine the design and quality assurance of a work‐based learning programme for qualified social workers, placing particular emphasis on the development of an appropriate learning model. We consider some of the criticisms levelled at competence‐based education and argue that work‐based learning programmes composed of learning outcomes achieved entirely through practice can be compatible with the aims of higher education. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The recent Smithers critique of the role of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ) has opened up the debate about the effectiveness of this system for achieving the current goals of upgrading vocational studies and reforming the 14–19 curriculum. It is argued that, although Smithers is broadly correct in his attack on the NCVQ, there are some areas of ambiguity and also ways in which the critique fails to capture the full scope of the problems. The nature and full implications of the inappropriateness of the NCVQ enterprise is illustrated through an examination of the main weaknesses of National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) and the competence-based education and training (CBET) strategy which underpins them and, in particular, by reviewing some specific problems of learning and assessment and the findings of a number of recent critical studies. In view of the seriousness of these shortcomings of the NCVQ system it is suggested that perhaps the only genuine solution to the current difficulties lies in the recommendations of the 1993 National Commission on Education report for the abolition of the present system of academic and vocational qualifications. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Over the past few years there has been developing interest in competence based approaches to training in many contexts. This interest is also evident in management development circles in the consideration of competence based models of management education and development. This development has been met with enthusiasm in some quarters and constructive criticism with reservations in others. This paper seeks to consider some of the points about competence based training in general and apply them to social services management development/ education/training in the light of papers from CCETSW on post-qualification courses and the management element that they may include. The article is selective rather than comprehensive in its use of reference material. It considers what competence based models are; what the implications of their use might be in management development and looks in some detail at the relevant proposals made by CCETSW which follow a competence based approach. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Explains that the Sultanate of Oman is the only country in the world, other than the UK, to have adopted the national vocational qualification (NVQ) as its national system for vocational training. Assesses the extent to which centres in Oman have been successful in implementing the NVQ, and the extent to which the NVQ has contributed towards achievement of the Omani Government's objective of omanisation (replacing expatriate labour with Omani nationals). Discusses feedback from centres, which should be of interest to the Omani Government, the UK awarding bodies and others with an interest in the implementation of competence-based training. Concludes that the NVQ has been fairly successful in Oman, although local culture and context have not been adequately considered and catered for, and that the generally low competence of candidates in English is hindering their learning and skills development. © 2002, MCB UP Limited

AB  - The past six years have seen a major change in initial teacher training (ITT) in the UK through the introduction of national competences, later developed as standards, which govern the arrangements for teaching and assessing on all programmes leading to the award of qualified teacher status. This article takes as its focus the value to be placed on a competence-based approach to ITT in the context of a programme which gives emphasis also to reflection on practice. The issues are first explored in a general way, and then examined through a case study of one higher education institution ITT programme. Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1999.

AB  - The UK Management Charter Initiative (MCI) movement towards competence-based education is an indication of the growing attention being paid to the notion of the competent professional. There are already developments by the UK accounting bodies to develop detailed programmes to introduce competence-based education to accounting students. Competences have been defined in various ways – a behavioural description of workplace performance; doing rather than knowing; a focus on output (what a person can do) rather than input (what he or she has been taught). The underlying notion is to provide specific skills that are relevant to professional practice. The paper suggests that competences are not enough, and that what is required – meta-competence – can be learned but cannot be taught. Meta-competence is the overarching ability under which competence shelters. It embraces the higher order abilities which have to do with being able to learn, adapt, anticipate and create. Meta-competences are a prerequisite for the development of capacities such as judgement, intuition and acumen upon which competences are based and without which competences cannot flourish. The authors suggest that before syllabuses are created for the teaching of competence-based learning to accounting students, issue should be taken to confront the problematic nature of such teaching, should the existence of meta-competence be ignored. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - More than 50 percent of new contractors fail within the first five years of operation. This paper attempts to address the financial characteristics distinguishing successful firms from those less fortunate in an effort to improve instructional competencies and better prepare students for careers in construction. To accomplish this objective, benchmarking data from the Construction Financial Management Association (CFMA) and the Fails Management Institute (FMI) have been complemented by University of Florida focus group research of construction industry experts to identify key financial competencies related to contractor success. A case-study project was then developed to provide delivery and reinforcement of key competencies in business start-up, project financing, and construction business operations. Next, an outcome assessment survey was administered to construction financing students to evaluate key competency levels obtained. To test the relative success of the case-study project, course evaluations for three consecutive semesters during 2002-2003, prior to project implementation, and three semesters during 2003-2004, following project implementation, were compared. Outcome assessments found that students acquired significant competencies and skill sets identified as critical by construction industry experts as well as CFMA and FMI. Course evaluations further improved nearly 30 percent when compared to evaluations prior to teaching methods improvement.

AB  - This paper1 notes the apparent ineffectiveness of the critical response to competence-based education and training (CBET) and suggests that this results from a failure to correctly isolate CBET's unique, identifying features. It is argued that the prevailing tendency to identify CBET with 'competence' is fundamentally mistaken and that the competence approach is more properly characterised in terms of its philosophically naïve methodological strategy. It is suggested that this strategy is based upon untenable assumptions relating to the semantic status of statements of outcome and the epistemological and ontological constructs to which such statements are intended to correspond.

AB  - Purpose - To date, little attention has been given to the circumstances in which the process of developing key competencies for sustainable development may take place. The purpose of this paper is to consider, the possibilities both of formal and informal learning and their relationship to competence development within higher education. Design/methodology/approach - An explorative, qualitative study based on focus groups was designed using different groups from formal and informal learning settings. Findings - The development of key competencies is based both on cognitive and non-cognitive dispositions and asks for multiple contexts. Through combining formal and informal learning settings within higher education - as part of a new learning culture - a variety of contexts can be given and competence development can be enhanced. Research limitations/implications - While aspects of both formal and informal learning settings could be identified, the interdependencies between them remain elusive. Practical implications - Based on the findings, some main aspects for acquiring competencies can be pointed out that may be crucial in higher education settings. Originality/value - The paper analyses the implications for both formal and informal learning settings of new ways of developing key competencies within higher education. Particular attention is given to interdisciplinarity and students' self-responsibility. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - In this article we build a theoretical framework with which to analyse trendsetting learning biographies; that is, biographies that are prototypical realisations of a cultural script about how young people learn and live in late modernity. In the current debate on lifelong learning in knowledge-based societies learners are interpreted in an economical and psychological sense. Notions from youth, life course, and generation sociology are, however, needed to fully understand trendsetting learning biographies. We selected 14 Dutch younger adults (varying by class and gender) with these biographies, analysed their biographical narrations, and explored the importance of structure and agency in their learning biographies. Their life stories reveal a structured interrelation between an integrated life conception, special forms of social capital, and the key competence of biographicity. We conclude with some thought on the complications of theory building when interpreting learners in a biographical sense.

AB  - At a time when Britain's vocational education and training (VET) system and vocational qualifications are undergoing a major review and restructuring in response to critical reports about the model established under the former National Council for Vocational Qualifications, the British Council and associated agencies is currently trying to market National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) overseas. The chief weaknesses and failings of NVQs and the competence-based education and training (CBET) system on which they are based are outlined in terms of assessment anomalies and the needs of firms, trainees and employers. Since these shortcomings are so so serious, it is suggested that - until they have been remedied through the current reforms under the aegis of the new Qualifications and Curriculum Authority - it is ethically unjustifiable to export a failed VET system to countries which may be unaware of the critical research surrounding NVQs and CBET.

AB  - 1996 marked the tenth anniversary of the Review of Vocational Qualifications undertaken by Oscar de Ville (now Sir Oscar) and the setting-up of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ), of which he was the first Chairman. National Vocational Qualifications and Scottish Vocational Qualifications (NVQs/SVQs) have exerted a major influence on training and education in Britain. Despite widespread criticism from a number of quarters, NVQs have, until recently, appeared to enjoy a charmed existence, bolstered by official approval and supportive financial arrangements. The publication of the Beaumont Report, A Review of 100 NVQs and SVQs, in December 1995, may have marked a decisive turning point in the history of the NCVQ movement. This article outlines the development of competence-based education and training (CBET), and traces the influence of the 1981 New Training Initiative, including the transformation of its original ideas in the period leading to the publication of the 1986 Review. It considers some of the recent critiques of CBET. The article argues that the critics have misinterpreted the original ideas, and questions the conspiracy theory of CBET as a vehicle designed to take over education and training. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - James Park, the director of Antidote, criticizes those who believe that the most important task of education is to develop cognitive abilities, without any particular regard for emotional development. He argues that such an approach leaves individuals ill equipped to engage with the challenges that life throws in their path. He feels that, in spite of the recognition in the new National Curriculum Guidance of the significance of emotional processes on learning, government policy as a whole does not always appear to acknowledge this. In his view, ‘feeling and thinking, are engaged in a continuous dance. Individuals who can gracefully glide between the two modes bring energy to the task of learning and thinking’. He goes on to outline the key competencies that individuals require to achieve this, and suggests that these are most effectively achieved through dialogue ‘talking together in ways that allow individuals to understand the thoughts, feelings and values of each other’. The paper concludes with an explanation of the work and aims of Antidote. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) have been introduced and developed within a competency framework by successive UK governments. Potential benefits are listed as improved skills, less skills shortages and more appropriate job-employee fit. However, there has been considerable and sustained criticism of NVQs from employers, employees and academics. Criticisms include excessive bureaucracy, overly complex terminology and a lack of credibility of the competence concept. This case-based study examines the implementation of NVQs in an organisation based on 60 semi-structured interviews with those involved. The findings reveal that NVQ is seen as a training regime within the organisation and that there are no clear links to improved business performance or employee morale. Moreover, there were contextual problems in applying the standard. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - Social work education has long emphasized the need to provide competence-based education. However, little work has been done to identify, validate and evaluate competencies in specific fields such as addictions. The purpose of this study was to isolate a set of substance abuse intervention competencies using Motivational Interviewing that could be used to teach and evaluate students. The research proceeded in three stages. First, a modified Delphi approach involving social work practitioners was used to discern a set of positive and dysfunctional skills related to Motivational Interviewing. The primary researcher taught a graduate social work class aimed at teaching students theory and skills related to this model. Students demonstrated these skills with simulated clients through videotaped interviews. Finally, three observers rated the student interviews using this developed instrument. While inter-observer agreement was lower than anticipated, this study does provide early support for the development of competencies related to specific theoretical frameworks.

AB  - Organizations and their clients have limited tolerance for inept performance, particularly when it is a matter of life or death. Service organizations rely on the competencies of individual staff to produce and deliver core activities. In these organizations employees engage directly with clients in complex interactions as part of the process. High-level performance is required in challenging environments – and it does not occur by chance. Competencies are learned. In situations in which the risk to individuals and the organization is high, the education and credentialling of employees in key competencies is warranted. Educators are therefore engaged to teach competencies that are relevant and enhance an organization's performance. Competency-based education underpins effective risk management in service delivery organizations, most notably perhaps in those that deliver human services. However, the cost of competency-based staff development and evaluation programmes for large groups is often high. This paper describes: (a) the scenario of a large multi-campus medical centre that requires competency-based education in basic life support for 4,500 students and staff; (b) a process that entails the re-engineering of competency-based credentialling services through the design, integration and use of a multi-media CD-ROM; and (c) outcomes of enhanced learning and cost savings coupled with reduced organizational risk. © 2002, © 2002 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Examines the experiences of Germany and Sweden in their attempts to develop core skills and key competencies among trainees and young employees. Particular attention is devoted to vocational training as a promising school-to-work transition process, which stimulates and supports the development of core skills. Some case study material (Germany) and relevant policy responses (Sweden) have also been used to go beyond mere theoretical considerations and to provide some practical help and guidance when it comes to defining, implementing, assessing and administering the concepts of core skills and key competencies. In particular, the paper highlights the importance of employer enthusiasm in the development and delivery of core skills. © 2000, MCB UP Limited

AB  - Presents a perspective on vocational learning that proposes that vocational competence is dependent upon dispositional development, which in turn, results in moves towards maturation. Reports research with unemployed adults engaging in vocational training and resulting in four findings. First, while training packages describe assessable outcomes in competency-referenced terms, trainees describe learning outcomes in non-competency referenced terms. Second, vocational trainees describe their learning in terms of dispositional outcomes; that is, in terms of values, interests and attitudes. Third, dispositions can be categorised in terms of maturational concepts. Fourth, trainees made moves towards maturation as a result of CBT/NEIS training over the six-week period of the course. The findings have important ramifications for all future VET/CBT trainees since it is the researcher's formative theory that maturation is a subset of competence in every vocational skill domain. © 2003, MCB UP Limited

AB  - In order to be relevant and useful in a fragmented developing country context, community and regional planning needs to shift away from the use of rigid tools to more flexible, adaptive approaches. An international review of planning curricula indicated a widespread consensus with respect to key competencies required of planners. This understanding was used in the development of new teaching programs at three Sri Lankan universities. Complementing the technical core knowledge areas, strong emphases on problem structuring, critical and strategic thinking, and the understanding of the political and institutional contexts appear to be crucial to making the agenda of "planning for sustainable development" more than a fashionable cliché. In order for these core areas to have relevance in a developing country context, however, planning curricula need to achieve a balance between local priorities and a "global" perspective. © 2004 Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning.

AB  - An action research approach to curriculum development was used within a national funded project in radiography education. Its particular focus was the development of a competence-based approach to the clinical education and assessment of student radiographers. This paper explores the role of a facilitator of action research in such a context through examining key dilemmas that are presented. These concern the need to balance the search for pragmatic local solutions with strategies informed by national debates in the field of competence-based education and training; the balance of time between reflection and action in action research; and the tension between local solutions and national recommendations.

AB  - Begins by reviewing technical progress towards establishment of an effective and standardized, competence–based vocational education and training system, and compares this progress with the system in Germany. Describes a number of respects in which the system is failing to meet its objectives. Certain stakeholders are happier with the new approach than others. Also describes the political agenda behind the introduction of competence–based training, and compares the individualist, business–centred policy in Britain with the more collaborative approach in Germany. Britain's policy towards training is consistent with its policy towards the Social Chapter. Concludes that unless the political agenda is changed, regardless of any technical improvements made, retention of the current policy will consign Britain to a low–skill competitive position with respect to the rest of Europe. © 1996, MCB UP Limited

Findings are reported from a series of focus groups which were held in Missouri. Two sets of focus groups were held, five groups consisting of consumers of child welfare services and four groups consisting of child welfare workers. Results show a high degree of agreement between workers and consumers regarding essential competencies. The relevance of findings to practice, policy and social work education are discussed.

AB  - In the United Kingdom, the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists suggests that sociology should be included within the speech and language therapy curriculum. However, in spite of this, sociology is seldom given priority. Although the role of sociology with the curricula of other professions has been discussed, the role of sociology within speech and language therapy has not. Given the contemporary climate of competence-based training, the position of subjects such as sociology is being compromised. This paper sets out three reasons in support of including sociology within speech and language therapy by drawing on the distinction between a "personal education" and a "semantic conjunction" model of the relationship between theory and professional practice. First, it is argued that sociology makes a valid contribution to an holistic approach to care-which is rapidly becoming the cornerstone of speech and language therapy practice. Second, this paper suggests that the inherent reflexivity within the discipline provides health professionals with an invaluable tool with which to engage in reflexive practice. Finally, it is argued that given the global emphasis on evidence-based practice, the study of sociology and sociological research methods equips therapists to interpret and conduct empirical research. This paper concludes by arguing that sociology should be viewed as an essential component of the speech and language therapy curriculum.

AB  - Attempts by David Bridges and others to justify certain models of competence-based education and training (CBET) are criticised on the grounds that they do not challenge the behaviouristic nature of the functional analysis system which underpins CBET. Competence strategies serve to de-skill and de-professionalise teaching and other public-service occupations by their technicist and reductionist approach to human values and knowledge. Educators committed to liberal values should eschew competence strategies in favour of learning theories inspired by the experiential tradition.

AB  - Traditionally education has to contend with the problem that knowledge acquisition does not guarantee the successful application of that same knowledge. Yet, according to Whitehead, the ultimate goal of education should be to teach students to learn to apply knowledge. Furthermore, one is confronted with the problem that discipline-specific knowledge and skills are insufficient to respond adequately in a situation with discipline-transcending, new and unknown problems. Next to disciplinespecific knowledge and skills, more general knowledge and skills are needed in the area of e.g., communication, problem-solving, use of information, analysis, decision-making. General knowledge and skills, however, offer no guarantee whatsoever that somebody also has sufficient discipline-specific expertise at his disposal. These are the problems that Nijenrode University wants to solve with a new curriculum for management education. In the curriculum developed by Nijenrode, students learn to apply heuristics in the area of general skills and meta-skills (reflecting and learning-to-learn) in interaction with a varying discipline-specific learning content. In this context, discipline-specific knowledge and skills on the one hand, and general skills and meta-skills on the other hand are, in relation to each other, both the objective as well as the means. The student learns the one thing with the help of the other and vice versa, by means of a continuing process of contextualization and decontextualization. The curriculum is a response to the challenge confronting management education to prepare students for future management positions in a world which is characterized by continuous change. The response may be interesting for other types of vocational and professional education as well. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Educationalists experience difficulties with the construction of competence maps that describe final attainment levels of educational programs. Web-based support was developed with three supportive aids: A construction kit, a phenomenarium, and an information bank. Each supportive aid was expected to improve perceived process and product quality as well as learning. In a full factorial experiment, 266 educational science students constructed a competence map, whether or not supported by different combinations of the three supportive aids. The availability of the construction kit and the phenomenarium had positive effects on perceived process quality and learning. Furthermore, if there was no phenomenarium with example materials, the absence of the construction kit greatly diminished experienced support (i.e., one aspect of process quality); if a phenomenarium was present, the availability of the construction kit had relatively little effect on perceived support. In general, this study indicates that well-designed Web-based support helps to construct competence maps. © Springer 2006.

AB  - The ongoing trends of rapid technological development and globalisation have reshaped several industries during the past decade. For one, the newly emerged challenges have triggered a wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) within a number of industries as companies have sought efficient ways to enhance their business capabilities and to restructure themselves to better adapt to the new business environment. This paper discusses the value creational aspects of international M&A and addresses matters of resource redeployment and capability transfer related to the logistics operations of manufacturing companies. The empirical part of the paper reports on an explorative multiple-case study covering six horizontal M&A deals carried out by Finnish manufacturing companies during 1998-2001. Results suggest that the combining of complementary resources, in particular, and capability transfer (e.g. of technology-related knowledge) can create value through the transference of existing key competencies to new contexts, as well as through creating new capabilities.

AB  - A post-qualifying course in psychodynamic approaches to practice used a competence approach to evaluation of course and training outcomes. The first phase of the evaluation was reported in Journal of Social Work Practice (1993, 7(1), pp. 63-72). The second evaluation phase focused on 14 'core' competences identified by expert practitioners as being central both to psychodynamic practice and to analysis of training outcomes. Four ratings of confidence by students and three ratings of skill by tutors were completed each year, for four years. Sixty-four students, 41 of whom were social workers, were assessed this way. The resulting data were highly variable for both students and tutors, although the trend towards improvement in skill and confidence was clear, most markedly over the final phase of the course. While this suggested the overall effectiveness of the course, factor analysis failed to identify any more specific discrimination of skill components. More evident were global judgements of competence, by tutors in particular. As with other competence-based training programmes, comparing assessments of competence with actual therapeutic outcomes might advance the identification and evaluation of practitioner competence.

AB  - This paper examines Australian national policy documents that have brought together developments in competency-based education and inclusive curriculum in the formulation of a Key Competency concerned with cultural understandings. Particular attention is given to the definitions of culture and workplace culture, the choice of contexts for the display of cultural understandings as a competency, and the proposed evaluative frameworks. The paper also shows how the documents are variously consonant with the emphases of critical and liberal approaches to culturally inclusive curriculum practice. Finally, consideration is given to the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the cultural understandings competency. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this work is to show that one of the competences that nowadays must be fostered, if we really want to respond to the demands for workforce from a socioeducational perspective, is that of self-formation. There is little doubt that the development model that society currently wants to implement requires a larger formative volume, a higher level of formation of each individual. However, we also think that it demands a model of formation which, if not different, is at least complementary to that one. Looking beyond an individualist, intellectualist, isolationist, and abstract pedagogy based on a logic of knowledges and institutions, we believe that the formative system must rescue a more social and global view of the processes of production and of life. A logic grounded on the modes of action that take place in the world of life and work. Overcoming the simple lists of competences, we have asked ourselves how the competences are generated, acquired and developed, and we have concluded that the approach of self-formation responds not only to certain economic trends, but also to the transformations that society has experienced along the last decade. Keeping in mind that the human being is more than just a productive, labor node, and that self-formation is a characteristic expected of the subject as such, in his/her, totality and relation with the surroundings, we conclude this work by presenting self-formation as a key competence and model of formation for the society of the 21st century.

AB  - This is an examination of the current status and future potential of older workers in organizational settings. This analysis will necessarily require a reexamination of traditional models of career stages, particularly in relation to issues of aging in the career context. The paper starts with an examination of the “career contract,” the set of mutual expectations between employer and employee and on the ways that contract has changed over the last decade. Our summary view of the new contract is that it reflects a move from an organizationally based career to a protean or self-based career. This change has particularly strong implications, positive and negative, for older workers, and these are explored in depth. We argue that the contemporary high-speed work environment demands two key competencies (which we call “meta-skills,” since they are skills for learning how to learn): identity development and heightened adaptability. The development of these meta-skills occurs through a process of midca- reer “routine-busting.” In our view, this suggests a new view of career stages, in which the focus is on many cycles of learning stages (continuous learning), rather than a single lifelong career stage cycle. The paper concludes with the implication of these new career concepts for the development of older workers, questioning the currently popular model of retraining and calling instead forcontinuous learningas a means of providing lifelong development for workers of all ages. © 1995 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - The part played by tacit skills and knowledge in work performance is well recognised but not well understood. These implicit or hidden dimensions of knowledge and skill are key elements of “mastery”, which experienced workers draw upon in everyday activities and continuously expand in tackling new or unexpected situations. This paper, based on the ESRC Teaching and Learning Research Network on Workplace Learning, argues that it is important to understand better how tacit forms of key competences can contribute to sustaining learning outcomes in different types of learning environments. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - The subjectivity of workers, articulated in terms of the personal attributes required in ongoing conditions of economic change, has been at the forefront of current discussions of generic skills in Australia. This article explores the discursive construction and reconstruction of the 'competent' learner-worker from its initial elaboration in the Mayer Committee's 1992 report on Key Competencies to its re-specification in contemporary reports concerned with developing a new framework of 'employability skills'. I argue that various theories of subjectivity necessarily (if implicitly) mobilized in any consideration of the personal attributes of learner-workers generate confusion around their learnability. I suggest that a nature/nurture dichotomy haunts past and present discussions about the personal attributes of learner-workers and that this will likely create stumbling blocks as policy makers and educators attempt to codify personal attributes for the purposes of including them in training programs. Apart from its conceptual problematics and incongruities, the whole project of specifying the desired personal attributes of learner-workers and making these available for assessment against competency standards is necessarily a normalizing exercise. As such, the project will be subject to refusal, resistance, contestation, or appropriation in various ways by educators, trainers and worker-learners alike. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

AB  - CONTEXT: In 2003 the Dutch Central College of Medical Specialties presented guidelines for the modernisation of all medical specialty training programmes in the Netherlands. These guidelines are based to a large extent on the CanMEDS (Canadian Medical Education Directives for Specialists) 2000 model, which defines 7 roles for medical specialists. This model was adjusted to the Dutch situation. The roles were converted to 7 fields of competency: Medical Performance; Communication; Collaboration; Knowledge and Science; Community Performance; Management, and Professionalism. OBJECTIVE: As changes in postgraduate training will probably be most effective if future trainees recognise their value, we set out to determine how senior medical students rated these fields of competency in terms of their importance. METHODS: We carried out a study at University Medical Centre (UMC) Utrecht, the Netherlands, in which 80 Year 6 medical students answered a questionnaire in which they rated the importance of each of 28 key competencies within the 7 competency fields. RESULTS: Although all key competencies were regarded as important (averages ≥ 3.8), Professionalism and Communication scored highest on the student ratings. Management was assessed as least important. CONCLUSIONS: It is interesting that medical students acknowledged the importance of competencies other than those involving medical expertise and performance. It confirms the opinion that educating doctors is currently viewed as much more than providing theoretical and clinical knowledge and skills. The CanMEDS framework is appreciated by Dutch medical students. The fact that all competencies are seen as important adds to their face validity and therefore to their usefulness as a basis for postgraduate training. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Recent policy developments within the public service sector have led to widespread de-professionalisation and a general loss of motivation and morale within education, health and social work. This state of affairs has been brought about by the imposition of a social market on public sector professions and through the introduction of competence-based education and training (CBET) strategies into professional studies. These developments are criticised for their failure to capture the essential epistemological and moral dimensions of the work of professionals, and programmes for professional regeneration are recommended through the renewed emphasis on the workplace as the site of professional learning. Work-based learning may enable professionals to re-affirm the importance of experiential learning and reinforce the centrality of the ethical bases of professional practice.

AB  - The expanding influence of competence-based education (CBE) through the activities of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ) now extends to all levels of the system, including the work of higher education institutions. The NCVQ approach is, however, ill-equipped to deal with education and training beyond the level of basic skills, and is largely irrelevant to the sort of learning that goes on in higher education. A critique of the NCVQ model of CBE is presented and, in place of the behaviourist obsession with performance outcomes, models of learning and development drawn from the cognitive and experiential tradition are recommended for higher education. Educators in this sphere need to maintain an attachment to critical practice and the humanistic tradition in order to resist the narrow utilitarian models of practice represented by CBE strategies. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In the Dutch Vocational Education and Training (VET) system, competence-based education is the leading paradigm for innovation, both at the system level and at the level of learning environments. This article provides an historical analysis of the development of competence-based education in various countries and explores the concept of competence and its popularity. Possible pitfalls with respect to the concept of competence, standardisation, school and workplace learning, determining learning activities, assessment of competencies, changing teacher roles/identity and competence-based management will be discussed. Taking these pitfalls into account, roads for future development will be sketched. A learning policy connecting governance, practice and research is believed to be the most fruitful way to develop flexible VET systems that are suited to the emerging knowledge-based economy. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article will examine the design and delivery of an introductory module on Film for the first year of a part time open access degree programme, the BA Combined Studies, franchised to Harrogate College by Leeds Metropolitan University. A Neo formalist method characterises the approach to Film understood as being at the intersection an an interdisciplinary mode of study. The concept of Stardom is the focal point of the module taking the images and personas of Garbo, Dietrich and Harlow as objects for critical cultural analysis. The aim of the course is to encourage mature students to explore new avenues of enquiry, develop visual and aural literacy and to recognise the aesthetic dimension of the film medium and its personally transformative potential. Students are encouraged to acquire the disposition to become reflective practitioners and so learn how to learn, to rationally articulate feelings and institutions and to develop confidence in forming and expressing their own aesthetic and other judgments. The article concludes by arguing for the development of expressive objectives for both open access adult learning and Film/Aesthetic education. Some attention is also focused on teaching method, learning resources and the development of aesthetic sensibilities and cultural understanding in an adult education context. The intention is to produce a reflective case study on Film and Adult learning based on actual experience rather than a theoretical discussion on Film or competence based education. © 1996, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Interest in professional development based on competence-based education and training (CBET) is growing. Competence models undoubtedly pose some important, constructive challenges to traditional arrangements for developing knowledge and expertise at all occupational levels. However, CBET's impact goes far beyond this. Its processes profoundly affect how teachers and learners view learning, assessment and the purposes of education itself. CBET is also symptomatic of wider changes in notions about ownership, pluralism and breadth in post-compulsory education and training. It therefore poses a profound and forceful ideological challenge to particular educational values, and to the way teachers approach their professional role. This article uses post-16 teacher education as a focus for exploring some of these wider effects. It reviews recent critiques of CBET and argues that many are preoccupied with attempting to improve its efficiency at the expense of examining the wider political and ideological context in which it is being implemented. In order to counter the drift towards a narrow utilitarian curriculum in all sectors of the post-compulsory system, analyses of CBET will need to show its powerful effect on some important democratic traditions in learning and education. This would provide the basis for a more coherent model of professional development than the limited and fragmented choices currently on offer. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), launched by governments of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1997, aims at assessing some of the key competencies that contribute to the success of 15-year-old individuals, on a regular basis and within an internationally accepted framework. PISA seeks to provide a basis for policy dialogue and for collaboration in defining and implementing educational goals, in innovative ways that reflect judgements about the skills that are relevant to adult life. PISA defines competence as the ability to successfully meet complex demands in varied contexts through the mobilisation of psychosocial resources, including knowledge and skills, motivation, attitudes, emotions, and other social and behavioural components. Measuring and comparing competencies across languages and cultures is a difficult challenge and is being pursued by PISA progressively. PISA focused its first three assessments on literacy skills, defined as the capacity of young adults to access, manage, integrate and evaluate information, to think imaginatively, to hypothesise and discover, and to communicate their thoughts and ideas effectively. The reasoning behind shifting the emphasis from assessing whether students can reproduce what they have learned towards whether they can extrapolate from what they have learned and apply their competencies in novel situations, derives from the nature of knowledge and skills required in modern life. For example, the tasks that can be solved through simple memorisation or with pre-set algorithms are those that are also easiest to digitise, automatise and offshore, and will thus be less relevant in a modern knowledge society. Since there is no overarching cross-national and cross-cultural agreement on what fundamental competencies 15-year-olds should possess, an international assessment such as PISA can only capture a selection of competencies. Moreover, since various methodological constraints limit the nature of competencies that are currently amenable to large scale assessment, PISA cannot capture the entirety of competencies that will make young people successful. However, the findings presented in this article suggest that the competencies that PISA does assess are highly predictive for the future success of students. In addition, PISA provides policy makers and practitioners with useful tools to improve quality, equity and efficiency in education, by revealing some common characteristics of students, schools and education systems that do well. In a modern world, comparative assessments are an essential tool for educational improvement and research shows that the existence of standardised assessments and examinations is one of the most powerful predictors for the success of an education system. That is not hard to understand, because without such assessments, all students, schools and education systems look the same, it is impossible for teachers and school administrators to detect institutional and systemic strengths and weaknesses, and to support and intervene where expectations are not met. Without reliable and comparable information on learning outcomes, teachers and governments alike rely on input-based incentives and policies that are all too often mirrored in large quality variation between schools as well as a strong dependency between learning success and the socio-economic context of students and schools. Last but not least, it is important to keep in mind that the absence of the reading, mathematical and scientific competencies measured by PISA does not automatically imply the presence of all those important competencies that have not been measured. © 2007 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.

AB  - A set of native French speakers' student interviews undertaken during a project encompassing the teaching of cultural awareness at Upper Secondary level, has been analysed to assess the students' cultural competence. The main differences between students' performances was the level of inter-activeness or ability to build from the interviewee's responses rather than interviewing from a pre-programmed agenda. Three different levels of competence are identified: limited, adequate and high, depending on the interviewer's responsiveness. These levels do not depend on the student's linguistic ability but rather on the ability to understand contexts from another point of view. The manner of interviewing appropriate to the interviewee's culture is not considered and would need to be supported by quite different kinds of research and teaching. The student in the interviews takes responsibility for the content, organisation and style of the interview and does not follow a blind pre-set schedule. The pattern followed in oral proficiency interviews (where linguistic skill is measured) is reversed with student as interviewer and native speaker as interviewee. Quite different styles of interviewing seemed to be successful. The key factor was the student interviewer's ability to listen sensitively and respond appropriately, a key competence in cultural understanding. © 1996 M. Lessard-Clouston.

AB  - The core purpose of this paper is to describe a new educational paradigm as well as possible directions and tasks for education reform in the 21st century. The present-day education system has failed to nurture the kind of creative people who can play leading roles in development or to produce citizens of a good character and democratic tendencies. We need to look at education from the standpoint of expanding the totality of possibilities for national development. The current educational system of Korea can be characterized as one of "manpower-centered education." In this system, education functions to produce the human resources needed by the nation, and there is a strong belief in the classification and selection of high-quality human capital via the school system. We can think of an educational model that is parallel to the current system of manpower classification and selection and call it "competency-based education." In this model, the identification of individual ability, talent, and aptitude is deemed to be the most important, and the key task of education is selfactualization through recognition and cultivation of such talents and abilities. What educational values should be pursued within a new competency-based paradigm? First, we can reduce the relative weight of subject-centered education and introduce a competency-based curriculum in order to teach key competences for life. Second, new intelligence theories must be introduced into education in order to foster the development of students' talents, aptitudes, and potentials. Third, we can make use of positive psychology, which is a newly emerging field, the core concept of which is the belief that happiness in life depends on one's ability to develop and maintain positive feelings and emotions.

AB  - CCETSW has encouraged DipSW programme providers to work within a CATS framework, and CAT is a required feature of CCETSW's new post-qualifying awards. CCETSW's approach to CATS appears to be based on three assumptions: that academic credit should be given for practice learning, that there is a direct equivalence between academic and professional attainment, and that ‘competence-based’ training is appropriate for social work.

AB  - The Finn Report highlights the need for young people to collect, analyse and organise ideas and information as a key competency within the area of Workplace Language and Communication. This paper redefines the collection, analysis and organisation of ideas and information as a constituent part of the broader concept of information literacy. It is further suggested that information literacy should be identified as a separate key competency which is essential to the development of broad- based skills required for workplace efficiency and the ability to encompass change. The paper describes the competencies required within the field of information literacy as integral to all subject areas and recommends their infusion into the curriculum development process. It is further suggested that the competencies are not exclusive to one educational sector, that they should be developed in a continuum which encompasses the transition from school to work, from school to tertiary education and from tertiary education to work. A recommendation of the paper is that the Mayer Committee pursue the development of an information skills curriculum which would support the continued development of information literacy across all educational sectors. © 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Because learning and instruction are increasingly competence-based, the call for assessment methods to adequately determine competence is growing. Using just one single assessment method is not sufficient to determine competence acquisition. This article argues for Competence Assessment Programmes (CAPs), consisting of a combination of different assessment methods, including both traditional and new forms of assessment. To develop and evaluate CAPs, criteria to determine their quality are needed. Just as CAPs are combinations of traditional and new forms of assessment, criteria used to evaluate CAP quality should be derived from both psychometrics and edumetrics. A framework of 10 quality criteria for CAPs is presented, which is then compared to Messick's framework of construct validity. Results show that the 10-criterion framework partly overlaps with Messick's, but adds some important new criteria, which get a more prominent place in quality control issues in competence-based education. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is worldwide contestation at the moment over what constitutes the role, function and purpose of post-compulsory education and training. Through a sociological analysis of a particular instance in Australia known as ‘Key Competencies’, this article illustrates the way the competing discourses might be analysed around issues of access, equity and social justice. The article concludes that there are dangers in embracing economic rationalist interpretations of key competencies, but there are also progressive possibilities when vocationalism links work, learning and life in a contemporary social, economic and cultural context. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper outlines some of the issues emerging from research in to competence based training and assessment, and National Vocational Qualifications. A model for analysing the key purposes of formal assessment systems is suggested and a conceptual framework is presented which uses the notions of use and exchange value for gauging the worth of qualifications. The author presents material collected during a study of the training and assessment of student air traffic controllers to illustrate how contextual features, particularly at the occupational level, can affect the purpose and design of a qualification as well as the value attached to it by recipients and employers. It is suggested that elements such as: 'purpose', 'perceived value''qualification design' and 'context' provide a conceptual framework within which further understanding of the role of qualifications can be achieved. The longer term aspiration of the analysis begun in this paper is the development of a contextsensitive theory of occupational qualifications. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Diagnostic reasoning is a key competence of physicians. We explored the effects of knowledge, practice and additional clinical information on strategy, redundancy and accuracy of diagnosing a peripheral neurological defect in the hand based on sensory examination. Method: Using an interactive computer simulation that includes 21 unique cases with seven sensory loss patterns and either concordant, neutral or discordant textual information, 21 3rd year medical students, 21 6th year and 21 senior neurology residents each examined 15 cases over the course of one session. An additional 23 psychology students examined 24 cases over two sessions, 12 cases per session. Subjects also took a seven-item MCQ exam of seven classical patterns presented visually. Results: Knowledge of sensory patterns and diagnostic accuracy are highly correlated within groups (R2 = 0.64). The total amount of information gathered for incorrect diagnoses is no lower than that for correct diagnoses. Residents require significantly fewer tests than either psychology or 6th year students, who in turn require fewer than the 3rd year students (p < 0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of subjects is affected both by level of training (p < 0.001) and concordance of clinical information (p < 0.001). For discordant cases, refutation testing occurs significantly in 6th year students (p < 0.001) and residents (p < 0.01), but not in psychology or 3rd year students. Conversely, there is a stable 55% excess of confirmatory testing, independent of training or concordance. Conclusions: Knowledge and practice are both important for diagnostic success. For complex diagnostic situations reasoning components employing redundancy seem more essential than those using strategy.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to review the main perspectives or issues dealt with in the research on considered to be key competences, in order to develop a fuller understanding of how human competence functions. As a result of this review, two themes considered as having important implications for the actual practices can be identified: that there exists an holistic nature with different aspects of a given competence and that influences of a contextual and cultural nature are factors which affect the operation of human competence. By incorporating four characteristics and three domains of competence with the review conducted in this study, we began to appreciate what the research on human characteristics related to key competences has achieved and what is needed for future research.

AB  - This article discusses the praxis of non-governmental development organisations (NGDOs). It starts constating the crisis of the field of development cooperation and shows perspectives for a new strategic outlook. The crisis of NGDOs is on the one hand identified as a crisis of legitimisation and on the other hand it has structural causes rooted in political economy. Solutions which react by adopting mechanistic-objectivistic models of knowledge and organisation turn out to be inadequate due to the complexity of the crisis. Clearly more relevant are models of reflexive development cooperation that are based on a productive handling of contradictions, critique and dialogue. Increasing its capacities of reflection will have to become a key competence of NGDOs, decisive for its own future and a vision for development cooperation in general. The article ends by making a pleading in favour of creating spaces of reflection and dialogue in the field of development cooperation - and whereever relevant.

A detailed critical analysis of the MCI materials in Management Education is presented, in order to show how many of the problems raised by these documents have been resolved in an alternative format for competence-based education devised by the ASSET Programme, a competence-based degree level qualification is social work, recently developed by the author and a colleague from Essex Social Services Department. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The use of competences has proved to be perhaps the major growth area in management development during the last ten years. An increasing number of organizations have looked to competence-based training as the solution to enhancing the performance of their managers. But there remain several fundamental weaknesses that supporters of competences have yet to counter adequately. Identifies and challenges the dominant myths behind the competence approach, the suggestion being that it is perhaps time to stop and evaluate the usefulness of competence-based training in more depth. © 1997, MCB UP Limited

AB  - The rapid expansion of competence-based education (CBE) through the work of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ) has now, thanks to generous public funding and official endorsement by the Department for Education, penetrated the theory and practice of professional studies in teacher education at both school and post-school levels. The NCVQ model of CBE is criticised and alternatives described. The current NCVQ approach is neither the only nor necessarily the most appropriate model of occupational development on offer. Models of professionalism based on the concept of ‘expertise’ are recommended as the ones most likely to produce the reflective practitioners required to enhance the status and quality of teaching in schools and colleges. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - At an early stage in the development of competence based vocational education and training in the UK the Association of Accounting Technicians was planning a fundamental rethink of its own scheme. The Association decided to proceed within the framework being set up by the national council which allowed for maintaining the principles and criteria it had already identified as particularly important in its own situation. With the new scheme now nearing full implementation this is a review of how it evolved towards a bespoke product granted accreditation in terms of nationally agreed standards of competence for accounting work at the technician level. A key issue in competence based education and training is the need to secure confidence in the assessment process whilst ensuring that the skills and understandings assessed are vocationally relevant. How this and other issues were addressed is fully discussed. © 1995, by Taylor & Francis Group. LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present paper, I am going to present general assumptions of the technology education system as modelled in Poland with an example of a syllabus, text-book and work books for technology in elementary school and gymnasium. It is required to develop the system of technical skills including informatics skills which manifest themselves in key competencies determining the quality of a human life. Technology education is (should be) sphere of pedagogical activities helping students on way of building own human natures. Technology education can cooperate in significant manner with all these pedagogical activities (education spheres), which aim to restoring subjectiveness, of strengthening individualities and of uncovering identities of students (pupils).

AB  - Graduates of public administration programs regularly find themselves in roles accorded substantial responsibility and authority. It is therefore crucial that these programs provide effective instruction that helps students develop leadership skills and attributes. The dilemma is that leadership concepts are not susceptible to traditional didactic instructional approaches, which are cognitively based. Leadership learning is best accomplished in the affective and behavioral domains as well as in the cognitive. We present a pedagogical model that we believe is more appropriate for teaching leadership in public administration, public policy, and public affairs. This model marries the key competencies of effective leaders with suitable teaching orientations. We illustrate how this model may be applied by describing a graduate leadership course we have developed and taught. © 2007, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Using computer-based simulation to assess clinical skill-a key competence for medical trainees-enables standardization and exposure to a broad sample of physical findings. The purpose of this study is to provide evidence of construct validity for a computer-based outcome measure of neurology clinical skills. Method: A total of 128 medical students and neurology residents at four institutions volunteered to take a 34-question computer-based test designed to measure neurology clinical skills. Subjects were classified into three groups based on level of training: novice, intermediate, and experienced. Results: Overall performance increased with level of training. Question difficulty discriminated between groups as predicted. Twenty-six of 34 individual items discriminated between novices and more advanced learners. This test separated learners at different levels of training with a consistency of .92. Conclusion: This study provided evidence of construct validity for a computer-based outcome measure of neurology clinical skills.

AB  - The article explains how a formative evaluation in the context of a university in a developing country involving different stakeholders contributed to the development of proposals to improve ongoing educational practices. The case to be discussed is the implementation of generic competencies in the Faculty of Education at the Eduardo Mondlane University in Mozambique. The evaluation was carried out when the first group of Master's students of the faculty was about to finish their studies. It shows how the evaluation of a competence-based curriculum can bring university staff, their students and representatives of the world of work together. The common goal is the improved training of competent professionals, taking into account the learning process of the students, their professional practices and the specific difficulties they encounter.

AB  - This paper notes the critical response that the 'competence movement' has received from writers in philosophy of education and argues for a more positive assessment of what it offers in relation to: (i) the place of practical competence in a liberal education, (ii) the meritocratic principles underlying the competence movement, (iii) the 'transparency' of expectations in assessment, and even (iv) the element of practical competence in moral performance. It emphasises, however, that not all versions of 'competence' can be defended in these terms and that this requires a more generic and cognitively laden concept of personal and professional competence. © The Journal of the Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britain 1996.

AB  - Imagine a course block in which students discuss the cultural implications of 17th century iron working in North America in one hour, and design experiments to examine connections between composition and strength in modern steel padlocks immediately afterwards. In the Paul Revere: Tough as Nails course block, students don't just study materials science and history of technology topics, they experience them. Through a series of readings, discussions, and self-designed projects, students explore materials science concepts alongside the social, cultural and environmental factors that shaped technological and scientific history. Although the course includes many formal in-class activities, approximately half of all class sessions are flexible, allowing students to engage in individualized learning approaches. The projects are loosely framed, enabling students to develop key competencies while investigating topics of personal interest and controlling project focus and direction. In this paper, we discuss the processes and motivating factors that led to the initial design and continued development of the Paul Revere: Tough as Nails course block. We describe the pedagogical and practical benefits of the course, and we elucidate the important role the course plays in Olin's engineering curriculum. © 2006 TEMPUS Publications.

AB  - Purpose. Educators have begun to question whethei medical students are adequately prepared for the core clerkships. Inadequate preclerkship preparation may hinder learning and may be predictive of future achievement. This study assessed and compared the views of clerkship directors regarding student preparation for the core clinical clerkships in six key competencies. Method. In 2002, a national survey was conducted of 190 clerkship directors in internal medicine, family medicine, pediatrics, surgery, obstetrics/gynecology, and psychiatry from 32 U.S. medical schools. Clerkship directors were asked to report their views on the appropriate level of student preparation needed to begin the core clinical clerkships (none, minimal, intermediate, advanced), and the adequacy of that preparation (ranging from "much less" to "much more than necessary") in six key clinical competencies. Results. A total of 140 clerkship directors responded (74%). The majority reported that students need at least intermediate ability in five of six competencies: communication (96%), professionalism (96%), interviewing/physical examination (78%), life-cycle stages (57%), epidemiology/probabilistic thinking (56%), and systems of care (27%). Thirty to fifty percent of clerkship directors felt students are less prepared than necessary in the six competencies. Views were similar across all specialties and generally did not differ by other clerkship director characteristics. Conclusions. Almost half of clerkship directors were concerned that students do not receive adequate preparation in key competencies before starting the core clinical clerkships. Many medical schools may need to give more attention to the preclerkship preparation of students in these high-priority areas.

AB  - As part of a broader research objective concerned with identifying the range of employer defined skill profiles that characterize workplace performance, this paper examines skill contexts for Application of Number, one of six UK defined Key Skills similar to Australian defined Key Competencies. Following the construction of questionnaires, grounded in the Analytic Hierarchy Process, applications of the instrument in both the UK and in Australia produced a ratio scale of priorities within the Key Skills area. This enabled a specification of the relative balance between classical competencies, e.g. facility with pen and paper calculations and emerging competencies demanded by the effective use of ICT. Relevance to workplace learning, including the transition from school to employment, and related aspects of mathematics education are discussed. Among the research outcomes is that spreadsheets are assuming a pre-eminent position and that this is an overriding priority for each defined activity and at each job level. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The former Soviet economies have, for the past 12 years, looked to the advanced economies in the west for help in reforming their systems of vocational education and training. These “transition” economies still bear much of the legacy of the previous system and culture – academic in orientation, firmly supply led and implemented through vocational schools which are in economic crisis. They are offered the western “consensus” – competence-based training systems and the introduction of common or “core” skills. However, in introducing these methods, approaches and concepts, fundamental flaws appear, flaws that have not been seriously addressed in their countries and cultures of origin. This paper tries to address the problems in dealing with concepts like “competence” and “core skills”, and suggests that we need a coherent, grounded concept of occupational competence to replace the relatively unquestioned “deficiency model” which these concepts represent. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - This contribution follows the descriptive review of Weigel, Mulder and Collins regarding the use of the competence concept in the development of vocational education and training in England, France, Germany and the Netherlands. The purpose of this contribution is to review the critical analyses brought forward by various authors in this field. This analysis also remarks on the most important theories and critiques on the use of the competence concept in the above-mentioned states, The systems of vocational education within the four states covered in this study are: the National Vocational Qualifications in England, the approach to learning areas in Germany, the ETED and the bilan de compétences in France, and the implementation of competence-based vocational education in the Netherlands, and these are the respective focal points for the critical assessments of the competence concept presented here. These critiques encompass such aspects as the lack of a coherent definition of the concept of competence, the lack of a one-to-one relationship between competence and performance, the misled notion that employing the concept of competence decreases the value of knowledge, the difficulties of designing competence-based educational principles at the curriculum and instruction levels, the underestimation of the organizational consequences of competence-based education, and the many problems in the field of competence assessment. © 2007 The Vocational Aspect of Education.

AB  - In this paper, we describe how the shortage of teachers accelerates the development of Dutch teacher education in a more competence- and school-based direction. We address three themes. First, we note that Dutch teacher education institutes are taking initiatives to develop competence-based curricula and assessment. However, until now these developments have had a weak foundation. Secondly, it is clear that schools are developing and carrying out teacher improvement plans, but that student teachers are seldom part of these plans. Thirdly, the teacher educators in schools cannot meet the professional standards yet. Teacher educators in teacher education institutes also need time and support to adapt to new circumstances. However, there are promising developments in the right direction. © 2000 Association for Teacher Education in Europe.

AB  - The economies in developed countries have been undergoing rapid transformation in the last two decades. The most important characteristics of the transformation are: the tertiarization of the economy; technological innovations and modernization; intensified competition in the world market; globalization; demographic trends and privatization. These changes have been creating new demands for more adaptable, multi-skilled and creative labour. To meet the demands, it seems necessary to reduce the gap between academic education and vocational education; to raise the general education background of vocational education; to widen the route from vocational education to higher education; to deploy competence-based curriculum development mechanisms; to strengthen the co-operation between the education authorities and employment organization as well as industries; to decentralize the delivery system and to involve employers more in the process of TVET. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This article addresses the issue of how to develop and implement strategies for organizations which are in a turbulent environment. In this situation strategic leadership is about managing radical change to achieve a dramatic improvement in performance, and business strategy is the simple business logic which management use to explain to shareholders and other stakeholders how they see the environment changing and how their organization will survive and grow. For companies which are experiencing rapid change, traditional approaches to corporate planning are too bureaucratic. They need to be supplemented with new approaches which enable management to take charge of strategy and to develop strategies for implementation. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This article is a critical review of two books (O'Hagan, 1996; Vass, 1996) which set out to assist practitioners and educators working with the competence framework in social work. O'Hagan offers a defence of the competence model and a series of case studies showing how competences can be evidenced. It is argued that this defence is inadequate and that the case studies unwittingly reveal a tendency for those using the model to ignore some vital dimensions of practice. Vass offers a comprehensive model of competence in social work. It is argued that this contains much of value to social work educators, but that their alternative structure is likely to confuse readers who are expected to work within national requirements. It is suggested that competence-based education has encouraged an unfortunate parochialism in social work education in the UK. © 1998, The Board of Social Work Education.

AB  - A high level of personal capacity, the relevant professional competence and technical skills are essential for a graduate's successful transition to the workplace. The purpose of this survey was to identify the main competencies that higher agricultural education graduates should possess, based on the perceptions of potential agricultural employers. The population of this study comprised public, private, and cooperative managers and employers in the agricultural sector in the provinces of Mazandaran, Khuzestan, Kermanshah and Hamedan (N=485). A sample of 212 employers was selected using a stratified random sampling method. A four-part instrument in the form of a questionnaire was developed by the researchers to gather the required data. Factor analysis was used to elicit the preferences of employers for key competencies. The results show that employers value generic competencies relatively higher than field-specific competencies for agricultural graduates entering the agricultural field. The generic competencies identified include communication skills, problem-solving ability, agricultural ethics, business and computer skills, and general administrative skills and abilities, such as leadership and team-work. Technical skills and agricultural professionalism were identified as field-specific competencies. To develop these competencies, a new didactical arrangement, including supervised agricultural experience programmes, experiential learning, and fundamental changes in the teaching and learning process are proposed.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to identify the information technology (IT) competencies needed for information professionals in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach - A survey instrument was designed to elicit responses on a variety of IT competencies. For this purpose 13 key competencies were identified, namely: IT basics; word processing; electronic mail; internet and intranet; graphics; presentation and publishing; spreadsheet; project management; design; development and administration of databases; system maintenance; design and development of web applications; system analysis and programming for validation by the information professionals. Findings - All 13 competencies except for system maintenance competencies were found to be important. Research limitations/implications - The questionnaire basis of the investigation means that the data are a reflection of subjective responses from the sample in question. Practical implications - The study has shown that there are certain competencies that are important, and yet the respondents were not exposed to these competencies. Educators should ensure that these competencies are part of the curriculum content of the courses offered by the LIS schools. Originality/value - The paper gives important insights into the skills that are really needed by information professionals in the contemporary job market. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Western firms need to define very ambitious objectives for developing their presence in the region. Asia strategy is more than the sum of individual countries strategy; it requires specific investment effects to develop human resources, to build assets and competencies. Strategic intelligence and relationships management are the key competencies which are needed. For Western firms it implies a complete transformation of management culture and practices. © 1995.

AB  - This article situates the concept of translation competence and its acquisition in the context of recent competence-based approaches to teaching and learning in general in higher education. It begins with the challenges posed by present-day curricula, the reform of university systems and corresponding changes in teaching requirements, in particular with reference to the European Higher Education Area. It then outlines the basic concepts of competence-based training, following Lasnier (2000), and proceeds to apply the concept specifically to translator training, building on the holistic and dynamic models of translation competence developed by the PACTE research group over recent years. The teaching and learning approach adopted is a translation task-based approach, organized in teaching units. Issues such as the establishment of objectives, task design, sequencing and assessment are all addressed. Finally, the entire approach is illustrated with a practical example. The course module chosen as an illustration is an introductory module to translation into students' A language or mother tongue, structured around six categories of competences, each with their own teaching and learning objectives and curricular content. © St. Jerome Publishing.

AB  - This paper uses an experimental design to estimate preferences of employers for key competencies during the transition from initial education to the labor market. The study is restricted to employers of entry-level academic graduates entering public health organizations in the Netherlands. Given the changing and complex demands in public health, we study the relative importance of generic and field-specific competencies during the transition from education to the public health field. A self-explicated approach and a choice-based conjoint analysis were used to elicit preferences of employers for key competencies. The results show that employers value generic competencies relatively higher than field-specific competencies for master level graduates entering the public health field. The results are relevant for the adjustment of training in public health. Universities should continue to train master level graduates in public health with high-level cognitive skills. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The National Staff Development Committee of the Vocational Education and Training Sector is promoting action learning as a preferred professional development strategy to support the implementation of key competencies. This paper reports on an investigation of action learning as trialed across five training areas within the Department of Employment, Training and Further Education in South Australia. Two semi-structured hour long interviews were conducted with participating staff, one at the beginning, the other at the end of the project, and two questionnaires were administered: the Stages of Concern Questionnaire and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. This paper focuses on the two interviews and these results are discussed in relation to the effectiveness of action learning as a change strategy that can move an organisation for learning toward becoming a learning organisation.

AB  - In recent months, certain major policy documents have highlighted the importance of facilitating the development of interpersonal communication competence in vocational teachers. These documents include the provocative Australian Education Council Review Committee Report (Finn Report) which lists interpersonal and personal development as one of six key competency areas. As new vocational teacher education courses like the Bachelor of Teaching are beginning to be developed on a national scale within Australia, it is appropriate to cater for the development of interpersonal communication competence in vocational teacher education curricula. Among the more vexatious questions which need to be addressed is the determination of whether vocational teachers can demonstrate interpersonal communication competence, particularly in relation to their professional roles. This paper examines current scientific literature on communication competence. Since competence implies more than skill alone, consideration is also given in this paper to ways of identifying vocational teachers’ understanding of interpersonal communication processes and their importance in relation to the facilitation of learning in the post-secondary vocational education sector. Such issues as assessing interpersonal communication competence in teacher-learner relationships by means of direct observation, video-based structured reflection, and self-analysis are identified for further study. Finally, implications are drawn for vocational teacher education curricula currently being developed within Australia. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lifelong learning encompasses formal and informal learning aimed at personal fulfilment, active citizenship, flexibility of employability and social inclusion (European Commission, 2001). Policy is often framed on the importance of skills in the new economies. Knowledge, being the foundation of modern economies, means learning is the central factor for economic sustainability and growth. The rhetoric surrounding lifelong learning has seen a significant focus on post secondary education in the vocational and higher education sectors. Research into the school sector and how well it prepares students for lifelong learning in the Australian context has been virtually non-existent. The current Australian school curricula often embeds competencies for entry into the world of work (Mayer key competencies, Employability Skills), but the inclusion of lifelong learning competencies or skills appears to have been overlooked. This is despite the significant role that school education plays in preparation of school graduates for a lifetime of learning. Without a framework of those skills and attributes of lifelong learning, it is not possible to reliably measure if or how well the school curriculum addresses the development of lifelong learning skills and attributes. This recent study within the Australian secondary school context was conducted to attempt to identify a framework of skills and attributes (a conceptual model) of lifelong learners leaving school for the last time. This paper details the outcomes of the study, where qualitative approaches were employed to explore the perceptions of 34 secondary school teachers, and from this data a conceptual model for lifelong learning is presented. This conceptual model may well help in answering the question "How well is the public secondary school system in an Australian context preparing students for a lifetime of learning" and provides much data, information and direction moving away from the rhetoric. It also allows a basis for further and much more extensive research within this area and may assist policy makers, administrators, curriculum developers and teachers in further advancing the effectiveness of school education within the context of lifelong learning. © 2007 Issues In Educational Research.
